1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,420
Speaker 1: The young

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 2: man

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
Speaker 1: I just saw you, just looking and smiling.

4
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,880
Speaker 1: You are so close to touching the touch.

5
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,700
Speaker 1: I'm still in awe of your dreams.

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:59,400
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you'll notice that your back is still in the back.

7
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,920
Speaker 1: The future is the only way to the future

8
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,380
Speaker 1: The endless endless endless

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,920
Speaker 1: The window from the end of the world

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,740
Speaker 1: The hot-pastus is the only way to the world

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,400
Speaker 1: The memories of the world

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,439
Speaker 1: The sky will be shining

13
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,980
Speaker 1: Shonen, Yoshiwa-ni-nare!

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,140
Speaker 3: Hello? Are you done with the Magi's checkup yet?

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,140
Speaker 3: Almost finished. Didn't

16
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,560
Speaker 4: I promise you I'd be done before today's experiment?

17
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,540
Speaker 4: There's something else, Ritsko.

18
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,480
Speaker 4: Three impossible things to do and you still beat the schedule.

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,580
Speaker 4: That coffee's cold.

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,520
Speaker 5: All three Magi systems have entered self-diagnostic locally.

21
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,480
Speaker 5: One hundred

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,600
Speaker 6: twenty-five team maintenance

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Speaker 3: has been completed.

24
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,420
Speaker 3: Confirmed. Well done, guys.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,660
Speaker 3: Go ahead and take a break until the test begins.

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,200
Speaker 3: Everything checked out.

27
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,960
Speaker 3: As usual, Mother's in good shape, but...

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,660
Speaker 3: Is it just me getting older?

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,860
Speaker 7: What? Do you want me to take my clothes off again?

30
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,760
Speaker 7: The next chamber is an ultra-clean room environment.

31
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,780
Speaker 7: Just taking a shower and changing your undergarments is insufficient.

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,080
Speaker 7: Why do I have to go through all this for a dumb autopilot test?

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,500
Speaker 3: With the advance of time comes the need for AVA technology to advance as well.

34
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,100
Speaker 3: To do so, we need a constant influx of new data.

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,340
Speaker 3: Now get undressed.

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,940
Speaker 3: Yes, ma'am.

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,600
Speaker 7: Alright, I'm here just the way you wanted.

38
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,560
Speaker 7: Butt naked and run through the wash cycle 17 times.

39
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,660
Speaker 8: Very good. And I want all three of you to stay that way as you walk through the room and board the entry plug.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:18,940
Speaker 8: What?

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,000
Speaker 8: Don't worry. The video recorders have been shut off. We do respect your privacy.

42
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,260
Speaker 9: Oh, sure you do, and that's not the point! This is a personal thing!

43
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,120
Speaker 9: The purpose of

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,900
Speaker 8: this experiment is

45
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,440
Speaker 7: to monitor

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,420
Speaker 8: the harmonics directly from your bodies, without the interference of your plugsuits.

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,020
Speaker 8: Aska, this is an order.

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,020
Speaker 7: Alright, but I don't want anybody peeking, okay?

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,800
Speaker 5: All

50
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
Speaker 7: pilots are ready for entry.

51
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,060
Speaker 3: Start

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,600
Speaker 5: test sequence.

53
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,080
Speaker 5: Beginning test. Initiate autopilot recording.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
Speaker 5: Inserting simulation plug.

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,900
Connecting the system with the simulation bodies.

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,140
Speaker 6: The simulation

57
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,020
Speaker 4: plug is now under

58
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,860
Speaker 6: the Magi's control.

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
Speaker 4: Man, that was fast.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,100
Speaker 4: The Magi are magnificent.

61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,320
Speaker 4: It's hard to believe that the first test took a whole week.

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,620
Speaker 3: Test duration will be three hours.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,960
Speaker 3: How do you feel?

64
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,920
Speaker 7: It feels quite hard.

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,700
Speaker 7: Yeah, it's a little different from the other times.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,660
Speaker 7: Something's wrong with my senses.

67
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,200
Speaker 7: My right arm's clear. Everything else feels fuzzy.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,000
Speaker 7: Ray, focus on moving the right hand.

69
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:27,920
Speaker 4: Right.

70
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,400
Speaker 5: Data collection is proceeding nicely.

71
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
Speaker 3: Everything's looking good.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,880
Speaker 3: Return the Magi to normal.

73
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,840
Speaker 3: Huh? A dilemma?

74
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,920
Speaker 3: Huh? You can sure feel their creator's personality, can't you?

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,680
Speaker 3: What are you talking about? Aren't you the one who created them?

76
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,360
Speaker 4: You don't know anything, do you?

77
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,860
Speaker 4: That's because, unlike me, you never talk about yourself, Ritsko.

78
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,700
Speaker 3: No, I don't. I only created the system uplinks.

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,040
Speaker 3: The basic theorems in the mainframe were my mother's.

80
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,880
Speaker 10: Are you double-checking this?

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,460
Speaker 10: Yes, sir. These are the parts that were installed three days ago.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,980
Speaker 10: The parts that are showing signs of deterioration.

83
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,260
Speaker 10: The 87th protein wall.

84
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,020
Speaker 10: With magnification, you can see some discoloration, but I can't identify it.

85
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,360
Speaker 11: It's got to be corrosion.

86
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,900
Speaker 11: There are slight variations in the temperature and conduction rate of the spots.

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Speaker 11: The clean rooms have been deteriorating a lot lately.

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,020
Speaker 11: The construction schedule was cut

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,840
Speaker 10: by 60 days,

90
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,640
Speaker 10: so it's possible some air bubbles might have gotten inside.

91
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,260
Speaker 10: B-Wing's construction is rather substandard.

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,420
Speaker 10: Well, this building was thrown up after the Angels appeared.

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Speaker 11: It's nobody's fault. Everyone was so exhausted back then.

94
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,540
Speaker 12: Well, just fix it by tomorrow, or Akari will chew our asses off.

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,020
Speaker 3: Understood.

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,280
Speaker 6: Another leak?

97
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,120
Speaker 6: No, it's some kind of corrosion in the protein wall above this floor.

98
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Speaker 6: Just

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Speaker 3: great.

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,800
Speaker 6: Could it affect this test?

101
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,640
Speaker 3: No, not at the moment, ma'am.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,460
Speaker 3: Then let's continue.

103
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,960
Speaker 3: We can't abort complex experiments because of minor technical problems.

104
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,980
Speaker 3: Akari would chew my ass off.

105
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:08,780
Speaker 3: Understood.

106
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,120
Speaker 6: Synchronization position is correct.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,580
Speaker 5: Connecting simulation entry plugs to AVA via the simulation bodies.

108
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,740
Speaker 5: Contact with AVA0 has been confirmed.

109
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,880
Speaker 9: AT field will generate R2.

110
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,720
Speaker 6: What's happening?

111
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,900
Speaker 6: Contamination alert! It's in Sigma unit on the A floor!

112
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,220
Speaker 6: The

113
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,600
Speaker 5: 87th protein wall is corroding and releasing heat.

114
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,340
Speaker 5: Abnormality in six pipe detected.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
Speaker 6: Corrosion of the protein wall is increasing

116
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,520
Speaker 6: at an incredible rate.

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,840
Speaker 6: It's spreading everywhere.

118
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,560
Speaker 6: Abort the test.

119
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:45,860
Speaker 6: Shut

120
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Speaker 3: off all flow through the six pipe system.

121
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,100
Speaker 3: Right.

122
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,780
Speaker 5: Numbers 60, 38, and 39 are all hermetically sealed.

123
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
Speaker 5: Corrosion present in six through 42.

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,760
Speaker 6: It's no good.

125
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,320
Speaker 6: The corrosion

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Speaker 3: effect is spreading along the walls.

127
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,360
Speaker 3: Deploy polysomes.

128
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,220
Speaker 8: Set laser power at maximum.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
Speaker 8: Snap every invasive particle.

130
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,640
Speaker 6: Corrosion is reached 6 through 58.

131
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,880
Speaker 6: It's here!

132
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,540
Speaker 6: Ray!

133
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,060
Speaker 6: Ray's simulation body, it's moving!

134
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,200
Speaker 6: Impossible!

135
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,460
Speaker 6: The corrosion is still spreading!

136
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,800
Speaker 6: It's invading the simulation body's active water system!

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
Speaker 7: How's Rey?

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,120
Speaker 7: She's alright!

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
Speaker 7: Eject the entry plugs immediately!

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,360
Speaker 7: Use the lasers!

141
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,020
Speaker 4: That's an AT field!

142
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,180
Speaker 4: It can't be.

143
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,379
Speaker 4: Is that an...?

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,880
Speaker 3: Pattern analysis is blue. ID confirmed. An angel.

145
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,060
Speaker 13: An angel? You let an angel get inside these facilities?

146
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
Speaker 9: I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,740
Speaker 13: No time for excuses.

148
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,200
Speaker 13: Right. Let's cut off Central Dogma.

149
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,940
Speaker 13: Isolate it from the Sigma unit.

150
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,040
Speaker 11: Initiate physical lockout of Central Dogma.

151
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,160
Speaker 2: Evacuate immediately.

152
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
Speaker 11: Abandon the box.

153
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,000
Speaker 4: What the hell are you doing? Come on.

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,140
Isolating Sigma unit from B4.

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,620
Closing all partitions.

156
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,780
All personnel in the area must evacuate.

157
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,500
Speaker 14: I know that.

158
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,940
Speaker 14: Take care of it.

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,540
Speaker 14: Cancel the red alert.

160
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,860
Speaker 14: Very good.

161
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,900
Speaker 14: Call the committee.

162
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
Speaker 14: Tell them there was an error in our alarm system.

163
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,660
Speaker 14: Daminated area is still descending, sir.

164
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,340
Speaker 14: It's spreading all over Sigma unit from the Privnow box!

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,440
Speaker 14: That's too close.

166
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,980
Speaker 14: Yes, much too close to Adam.

167
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,640
Speaker 14: We must stop the Angel inside Sigma unit.

168
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,660
Speaker 14: If necessary, sacrifice the Geo front.

169
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,420
Speaker 14: Ava status.

170
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
Speaker 14: They're standing by in the seventh cage.

171
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,820
Speaker 14: We can launch them as soon as the pilots are recovered.

172
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
Speaker 14: There's no need to wait for the pilots.

173
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,580
Speaker 14: Launch them immediately.

174
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,340
Speaker 11: What?

175
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,400
Speaker 14: You will launch Unit 1 first.

176
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,440
Speaker 14: If necessary, the other two Evangelions are to be abandoned.

177
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:51,860
Speaker 14: Unit

178
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,080
Speaker 11: 1 has priority?

179
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
Speaker 11: But sir, how can we possibly destroy this Angel without the Avas?

180
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,180
Speaker 14: If the Avas are contaminated first, we'll be finished. Get moving!

181
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,020
Speaker 14: Yes, sir!

182
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,940
Central Dogma's Sigma unit will be locked down in 60 seconds.

183
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,980
Thirty seconds until vacuum pump activation.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,960
Speaker 11: So that's the new Angel. Time to take a break, I think.

185
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,040
Speaker 9: Central Dogma has been sealed. Megadeth facilities are all occupied by the intruder.

186
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,500
Speaker 12: So, how do we fight the Angels without the Avas?

187
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,980
Speaker 3: Look at this. The border between the normal and heavy water. There's a higher oxygen content.

188
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,980
Speaker 3: Yeah, their preference is pretty obvious.

189
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,020
Speaker 10: It looks like the place where ozone is vented in to maintain aseptic conditions isn't contaminated.

190
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:53,740
Speaker 10: Does that

191
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,000
Speaker 6: mean its weakness is ozone?

192
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,800
Speaker 4: It would seem so.

193
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,680
Speaker 10: Injecting ozone. Ozone concentration increasing.

194
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,820
Speaker 10: It's working alright. Will this work?

195
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,380
Speaker 6: Zero A and zero B seem to be recovering.

196
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,560
Speaker 6: The

197
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
Speaker 10: area around the pipes is getting back to normal.

198
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,140
Speaker 10: True, but the central mass is proving more resistant.

199
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,880
Speaker 10: Alright, inject more ozone.

200
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,600
Speaker 3: Huh? What the...

201
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,320
Speaker 11: Uh-oh. It's not shrinking.

202
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,760
Speaker 11: Something's wrong. Heat levels are rising dramatically.

203
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,700
Speaker 6: It's not working. The ozone's not working anymore.

204
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Speaker 11: I don't believe it. It's absorbing the ozone.

205
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,360
Speaker 3: Stop the ozone.

206
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,140
Speaker 3: Amazing. It's actually evolving.

207
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,880
Speaker 2: What's going on?

208
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,640
Speaker 11: We've got an unidentified intruder.

209
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,500
Speaker 11: Someone's hacking into the subcomputer.

210
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,380
Speaker 11: Ah, not now.

211
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,760
Speaker 11: They're coming in C mode.

212
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,940
Speaker 11: We can't stop them.

213
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
Speaker 11: We've got to unfreeze the barrier.

214
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Speaker 11: Open a decoy entry.

215
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,260
Speaker 1: Decoy

216
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,280
Speaker 11: entry has been avoided.

217
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,180
Speaker 11: Running barrier.

218
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,840
Speaker 11: Barrier has been penetrated.

219
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,620
Speaker 5: Opening another false entry.

220
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,380
Speaker 11: Trace completed.

221
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,860
Speaker 11: The hacker's in this building.

222
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,380
Speaker 11: It's under B-Wing.

223
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Speaker 11: In the Primnow box.

224
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,900
Speaker 6: The optical pattern is changing!

225
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,540
Speaker 11: Those glowing lines are electronic circuits.

226
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,140
Speaker 11: It's an organic computer.

227
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,740
Speaker 11: I'm opening a new decoy entry.

228
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,300
Speaker 11: Negative. Too much interference.

229
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,660
Speaker 4: Cut off the main

230
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,100
Speaker 11: cable.

231
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,160
Speaker 5: Negative. It refuses to accept the command.

232
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,240
Speaker 6: Utilize the

233
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,660
Speaker 11: lasers.

234
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,280
Speaker 6: It's generating an AT field.

235
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,060
Speaker 6: There's no effect.

236
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,860
Speaker 11: Intruder is accessing the main security banks.

237
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,320
Speaker 11: It's cracking the passcode.

238
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,460
Speaker 11: 12th digit, 16th digit, it's in!

239
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,060
Speaker 11: - My God!

240
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,540
Speaker 11: - It's broken into the main pegs!

241
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,800
Speaker 11: It's reading all the files!

242
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,160
Speaker 11: We can't stop it!

243
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,600
Speaker 11: It's

244
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,540
Speaker 12: got all our codes!

245
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,220
Speaker 12: - What in the hell is it looking for?

246
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,480
Speaker 11: - It's scanning the main directories!

247
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,100
Speaker 11: Accessing codes for, oh my God!

248
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,220
Speaker 11: It's going after the Magi system!

249
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,680
Speaker 14: - Shut down the I/O system.

250
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:08,500
Speaker 14: System shutdown!

251
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,180
Speaker 11: Three, two, one!

252
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,260
Speaker 11: Quick and set it down!

253
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,260
Speaker 6: The Angel is entering the computers!

254
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,140
Speaker 6: It's made contact with Melchior!

255
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,880
Speaker 6: The Angel is taking over Melchior!

256
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,300
Speaker 6: What?

257
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,300
Speaker 6: Melchior is being reprogrammed by the Angel!

258
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,120
Speaker 6: Melchior auto self

259
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 15: -destruct has been initiated.

260
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Speaker 16: Overruled.

261
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,740
Speaker 11: Overruled.

262
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,200
Speaker 16: Overruled. Overruled.

263
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,900
Speaker 11: No! It's taking over Melchior!

264
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,520
Speaker 11: And it's hacking into Balthazar!

265
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,120
Speaker 11: Fast! Too fast!

266
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,320
Speaker 11: Its calculation speed is incredible!

267
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,720
Speaker 3: Change the login mode!

268
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,740
Speaker 3: Change synchronization code to every 15

269
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,220
Speaker 10: seconds!

270
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,760
Speaker 10: Roger!

271
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,300
Speaker 10: Yes ma'am!

272
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,000
Speaker 12: How much time did

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,400
we buy?

274
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Speaker 10: At least two hours, I think.

275
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,020
Speaker 14: The Magi have become our enemy.

276
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,560
Speaker 3: This angel must be composed of a group of nanomachines, each the size of a virus.

277
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Speaker 3: These nanomachines then group together to form colonies, and in a very short period of time,

278
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,540
Speaker 3: they mutate in a focused exponential series to form a sophisticated intelligent circuit.

279
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,360
Speaker 12: Evolution.

280
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:44,140
Speaker 3: Yes. They're continuously changing and adapting themselves to attain the best system to cope with any environment they may encounter.

281
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,860
Speaker 12: I understand. It's this angel survival mechanism. Total adaptability.

282
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,180
Speaker 12: The

283
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,320
Speaker 4: only effective countermeasure for an enemy that continually evolves to overcome its own weakness is to eliminate the host.

284
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,260
Speaker 4: If the Magi died, the Parasites died too. Therefore, Commander, I propose the physical

285
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,480
Speaker 3: destruction of the Magi.

286
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,060
Speaker 3: Impossible! Destroying the Magi means destroying headquarters itself!

287
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,900
Speaker 3: That's my recommendation as Head of Operations!

288
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,980
Speaker 3: You're out of line!

289
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,460
Speaker 3: This situation is the responsibility of my department!

290
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,260
Speaker 3: Why are you being so stubborn?

291
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,040
Speaker 3: This whole thing is a result of

292
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,800
Speaker 4: my carelessness.

293
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,300
Speaker 4: Why do you have to be like this?

294
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,160
Speaker 4: You never share the responsibility.

295
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,440
Speaker 4: Why won't you trust someone else?

296
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,580
Speaker 4: As long as this Angel keeps evolving,

297
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,740
Speaker 3: we still have a chance.

298
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,680
Speaker 14: By controlling its evolution.

299
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,680
Speaker 3: Yes, sir.

300
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,520
Speaker 14: We must structure an evolution that leads to self-destruction, death itself.

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,940
Speaker 12: We'll set it up so that absorbing the Magi will lead to an evolutionary dead end.

302
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,100
Speaker 12: If

303
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,160
Speaker 3: the Angels believe it to be their only practical means of survival,

304
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,560
Speaker 3: they may choose to coexist with the Magi's system.

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,440
Speaker 11: But how?

306
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,540
Speaker 3: What's your plan?

307
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,660
Speaker 3: Since this Angel is like a computer, we could hack into it by connecting it to Kaspar.

308
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,600
Speaker 3: Once we've done that, we could then upload some kind of auto-self-destruct program.

309
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,740
Speaker 3: But

310
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,020
Speaker 6: in order to do that, we'll have to remove the barriers that are protecting the last Magi.

311
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,060
Speaker 14: But if Kaspar is faster than the Angel, we'll succeed.

312
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,120
Speaker 4: Yes.

313
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,740
Speaker 4: This program, can it be ready in time?

314
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,820
Speaker 4: If Kaspar's taken over first, it'll be all over.

315
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,880
Speaker 3: I keep my promises.

316
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,300
Speaker 9: Red alert. Red alert.

317
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,920
Speaker 9: An emergency has occurred in Nerve headquarters.

318
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,520
Speaker 9: All D-class personnel must be back.

319
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:26,720
Speaker 9: - Fine.

320
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,780
Speaker 6: - What are those paper things, ma'am?

321
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,100
Speaker 3: - These are the developer's personal notes.

322
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,180
Speaker 3: - My god, they're access codes, the Magi secret codes.

323
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,040
Speaker 3: It's like having a map to all of

324
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,080
Speaker 6: the Magi's back doors!

325
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 6: Am I allowed to see these?

326
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,860
Speaker 6: I can't believe this is all INTC! Schematics! Everything!

327
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,980
Speaker 6: With these notes, we can program much faster than we thought. Right, ma'am?

328
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,459
Speaker 3: Mm-hmm.

329
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,760
Speaker 3: Thanks, Mom. With your help, we can make it.

330
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,819
*Bell rings*

331
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:25,939
Speaker 3: Okay.

332
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,140
Speaker 3: Wrench, please.

333
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,120
Speaker 4: Hey, doesn't this remind you of our college days?

334
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,480
Speaker 4: Board number 25, please.

335
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 4: So, why don't you tell me all about the Magi?

336
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:44,980
Speaker 4: It's a

337
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,820
Speaker 3: long story.

338
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,900
Speaker 3: Do you know about the personality transplant OS?

339
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,140
Speaker 4: Yeah. It's a system for implanting personality onto a seventh generation systematic computer

340
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,080
Speaker 4: to allow the system to think for itself.

341
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,240
Speaker 4: The same

342
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,560
Speaker 3: technology is used for operating the A-blast.

343
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,860
Speaker 3: The Magi's programming used one of the first test subjects.

344
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,760
Speaker 3: So, since my mother was the one who developed the technology...

345
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,920
Speaker 3: Wait. You mean it was her personality that

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,860
Speaker 4: was transplanted?

347
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,580
Speaker 3: That's right.

348
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,180
Speaker 3: In a very real sense, the Magi's brains are my mother.

349
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,400
Speaker 3: Is that why you want to protect the Magi?

350
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,400
Speaker 3: I don't think so. Actually, to be quite honest, I never really liked my mother.

351
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,300
Speaker 4: My

352
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,780
Speaker 3: decision was that of a scientist.

353
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 11: It's happening! Balthazar is being taken over!

354
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,040
Speaker 11: Flash

355
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,020
Speaker 15: -Eye auto self-destruction sequence has been determined.

356
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,580
Speaker 15: It started!

357
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,280
Speaker 15: Will occur 20 seconds after all three AI consent.

358
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:03,380
Speaker 15: Area of destruction will include geoid depth minus 280, minus 140, and floor 0.

359
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,460
Speaker 15: Under special command 582.

360
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,520
Speaker 11: Balthazar is now invading Casper!

361
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,860
Speaker 11: They're faster than us.

362
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,940
Speaker 11: They're faster, right?

363
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,960
But...

364
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,620
Speaker 15: T minus 20 seconds to self-destruct.

365
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,700
Speaker 11: My God!

366
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,440
Speaker 11: Casper will be taking over in 18 seconds!

367
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,160
Speaker 11: T minus

368
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,440
Speaker 15: 15 seconds to self-destruct.

369
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,960
Speaker 15: Ritzko, hurry!

370
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,880
Speaker 2: Don't worry!

371
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,820
Speaker 11: I've got one whole second to spare.

372
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,440
Speaker 11: Only

373
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,220
one second?

374
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:30,900
Speaker 6: That's

375
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,020
not a zero or a minus.

376
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,580
Speaker 6: Maya!

377
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,540
Speaker 6: We can do it!

378
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,500
Speaker 15: Hit it!

379
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,020
Speaker 15: One, zero.

380
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,760
Speaker 15: Autonomous self-destruct has been cancelled.

381
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,920
Speaker 15: Special Command

382
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,580
Speaker 2: 582

383
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,260
Speaker 15: is cancelled.

384
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,240
Speaker 2: Mash

385
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,220
Speaker 1: -Eye system returning

386
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,300
Speaker 15: to normal mode.

387
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,480
Speaker 15: Red Alert has been cancelled.

388
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,300
Speaker 9: Red Alert has been cancelled. Red Alert has been cancelled. All hands return to

389
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,500
Speaker 16: first

390
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,000
Speaker 16: state alert. What's going on out there?

391
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,760
Speaker 9: How am I going to get out of here naked? Somebody

392
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,280
Speaker 9: Somebody help me!

393
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,340
Speaker 9: Sigma unit has been released. T-minus zero three to magi reactivation.

394
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,220
Speaker 3: I must be getting old. These all-nighters are really rough.

395
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,640
Speaker 3: Yeah, but at least you kept your

396
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Speaker 4: promise again. You did good.

397
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,220
Speaker 4: Oh, thank you.

398
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,580
Speaker 3: You know, this is the first time I've ever really appreciated this paint thinner you call coffee.

399
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,940
Speaker 3: The night before she died, my mother told me that the Magi were the three aspects of her life.

400
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,380
Speaker 3: Herself as a scientist, herself as a mother, and herself as a woman.

401
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,520
Speaker 3: Those three aspects of her are struggling for dominance inside the Magi.

402
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,520
Speaker 3: She intentionally implanted the dilemmas of the human experience into it.

403
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,500
Speaker 3: Actually, each of the three programs are slightly different as well.

404
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,460
Speaker 3: You know, I don't think I'm the kind of woman who will ever have children of my own,

405
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,920
Speaker 3: So I don't really understand her as a mother, but I respected her as a scientist.

406
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,140
Speaker 3: However, when it came to her as a woman, I hated her.

407
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,100
Speaker 4: Well, you're rather talkative today.

408
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,840
Speaker 3: About some things.

409
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Speaker 3: The program that was installed in Caspar was the one of my mother as a woman.

410
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,840
Speaker 3: And she stayed a woman down to the very last second.

411
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,600
Speaker 3: How totally like my mother.

412
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,020
Speaker 3: *BANG

413
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,780
Speaker 16: In other words, darling kiss me

414
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 16: Fill my heart with song out, let me sing forevermore

415
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,860
Speaker 16: You are all I long for, all I wish you'd bend the door

416
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,660
Speaker 16: In other words, please be true.

417
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,240
Speaker 16: In other words, I

418
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,200
love you.

419
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,440
Speaker 17: Are the angel attacks and Ikari's responses actually ordained by the Dead Sea Scrolls?

420
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Speaker 17: Sele, the secret organization that controls both Nerve and the Human Instrumentality Project,

421
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,060
Speaker 17: joins with Ikari to verify the events of both the past and present.

422
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,480
Speaker 2: Will the answers be revealed?
