Speaker 1
The young man I can only see you, but I'm smiling. I'm so happy to touch my heart. I'm still in awe of the pain. But I'll see you soon. There is a way to see the future. The world is a great place. The world is a great place. If you're a hot dog, you'll be afraid of your thoughts. You'll be shining in the sky, a man, you'll be a fairy tale.

Speaker 2
Mama! Mama, they chose me! I'm an elite pilot now! I'm the best in the whole world now! I must keep this a secret, but I'll only tell you, Mama! Everybody's so nice to me now, I don't feel lonely anymore! I'm okay now, even without Papa! Look at me! Look at me, Mama!

Speaker 3
*Screams* No reason left to live. Nobody cares about me anymore. My father, my mother, nobody cares. I have no reason left to live.

Speaker 4
Are you Oscar Langley,

Speaker 5
so are you. Intelligence Division 2 just took the second child into protective custody.

Speaker 6
Right. It isn't like them to lose her in the first place. And then it takes seven days to find her.

Speaker 5
They must have done it on purpose. They're trying to make trouble for us, aren't they, Major?

Speaker 6
Could be. And the fifth child arrives to replace Asuka today. This whole thing is just too convenient.

Speaker 7
Rei Ayanami. There's a feeling about her, almost as if my mother-- Ray and my mother... What are you doing with them, father?

Speaker 8
Hello, Commander. Did you know my cat died? The cat my grandmother was taking care of? I hadn't seen it for a long time, but now I know that I'll never see it again.

Speaker 4
Why did you destroy the dummy system?

Speaker 8
It wasn't the dummy system that I destroyed. It was Ray!

Speaker 4
I'll ask you once more, why did you do it?

Speaker 8
I'm not happy anymore. Not even when you make love to me.

Speaker 9
Do whatever you want with me! It's never stopped you before!

Speaker 4
You disappoint me.

Speaker 9
You had no hopes or expectations of me to start with! I was nothing!

Speaker 8
What can I do now? What, Mother?

Speaker 7
Where have you disappeared to, Asuka? But what can I even talk to her about? Could I talk about Ayanami with her? All of my friends, Toji, Kinsuke, all of their homes have been destroyed and now they've left. Friends. I don't have anybody left. I could call my friend. and... nobody. I can't go see Ayanami again. I don't have courage to face her. I don't even know how to talk or act around her now. Asuka. Misato. Mother. What can I do? What can I do? Who?

Speaker 10
This song is good. Huh? Singing brings joy and revitalization to the human soul. I think that song is the highest achievement of the Lilam culture. Don't you agree, Shinji Ikari? How do you know my name? Everyone knows your name. I don't mean to sound rude, but you're rather ignorant of your own position.

Speaker 7
Oh, really?

Speaker 10
Who are you? I'm Kaoru. Kaoru Nagisa. I am like you. One of the selected children. The fifth child.

Speaker 7
You're the fifth child? Um, Mr. Nagisa... Call me Kaoru,

Speaker 10
Mr.

Speaker 5
Ikari.

Speaker 7
Mr. Ikari? Oh no, you can call me Shinji.

Speaker 5
The fifth child has just arrived.

Speaker 6
Kaoru Nagisa, Kaoru of the seashore. And all of his past records have been erased, just like Rei.

Speaker 5
But at least one record remains. He was born on the same day Second Impact occurred.

Speaker 6
The committee sent him directly to us. There must be something else.

Speaker 5
The Marduk report's file on the fifth child was classified. So I hacked into the intelligence department's computer system.

Speaker 6
I can't believe you did that.

Speaker 5
Oh, it was worth doing. I found out where Ritsuko is. So what do you want to do about the fifth child's sync tests?

Speaker 6
I don't have any tricks up my sleeve this time. Let's see what he can do.

Speaker 11
Take it down 0.3 more.

Speaker 6
Yes, sir.

Speaker 11
Are these data readouts correct? All of the test systems are operating correctly, sir.

Speaker 9
The Magi confirmed that there are no data errors.

Speaker 11
It's incredible that he can synchronize with Unit 2 even before we've reconfigured the core. He's amazing.

Speaker 6
But this isn't possible, sir. Nevertheless, it's happening. We must accept that fact and start an investigation into why it is so.

Speaker 10
You must be the first child, am I correct? You are Rei Ayanami. And you are the same as I am. How interesting that both of us have ended up in the same form as the Lilim for life on this planet.

Speaker 6
Identify yourself.

Speaker 11
The fifth child has made contact with Rey. I see. The Magi are currently analyzing the nature of the fifth and what his powers may be.

Speaker 6
And we still don't know who or what he is. Who in the hell is this boy? Shinji hasn't come back yet either. I guess I'm not deserving of his trust.

Speaker 10
Central Dogma is now open. Mays use route. We are the transfer. Hello. You weren't waiting here for me, were you?

Speaker 7
No. Well, not really waiting anyway.

Speaker 10
So what are you doing for the rest of the day?

Speaker 7
Well, usually when tests are over, I'll just take a shower and go home. But I don't really want to go home these days.

Speaker 10
The fact that you have a place where you can return, home will lead you to happiness. That is a good fact. You think so? I want to talk to you some more. May I come with you? To the shower, I mean. Aren't you going to the shower?

Speaker 7
Yeah.

Speaker 10
Or do you mean no?

Speaker 7
No, I don't mean no.

Speaker 10
You are extremely afraid of any kind of initial contact, aren't you? Are you that afraid of other people? I know that by keeping others at a distance, you avoid a betrayal of your trust. For while you may not be hurt that way, you mustn't forget that you must endure the loneliness. Men cannot erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone.

Speaker 7
It's time.

Speaker 10
Time to go?

Speaker 7
Yeah. I have to go to bed.

Speaker 10
With me?

Speaker 7
No, I think you have your own room that they gave you, I mean.

Speaker 10
Okay. You know, pain is something that man must endure in his heart. And since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe life is pain. You are delicate like glass, especially your heart. I am? Yes, and worth

Speaker 7
earning my empathy. Empathy?

Speaker 10
I'm saying I love you.

Speaker 12
The Nerve organization was established to execute the wishes of Sele. It was intended to enact the scenario we had created. However, it appears to have become dominated by a single zealous individual.

Speaker 1
Yes,

Speaker 12
it has. We must take it back into our own dominion. It is time. We must restore Nerve and the Ava series to their proper role. Ikari, you will take responsibility for betraying Sele.

Speaker 4
I'm afraid there's not much time left for accomplishing our goal. However, the Lance of Longinus, which would have impeded the realization of our plan, is now gone forever. The last Angel shall soon appear, and with its destruction, our wishes may be born. Soon, Yui, please have patience.

Speaker 1
Why am I here? Why am I still alive?

Speaker 3
For what purpose? For whose purpose? The fifth child.

Speaker 3
Why? In what way

Speaker 6
are he and I alike? Thank God this apartment block is on the outskirts of town. It's a miracle that it and you survived. But I can't guarantee your safety any longer. So the Haraki family will be taking care of you. From now

Speaker 13
on...

Speaker 6
I may not see you for a while, Pen-Pen.

Speaker 10
I think I should sleep on the floor. No,

Speaker 7
I'm staying at your place. I'm fine. I'll be okay on the floor.

Speaker 10
What did you want to say to me? What? You wanted to tell me something, didn't you? So much has

Speaker 7
happened since I came. Before this, I lived with my teacher. It was calm and boring in those days. I wasn't really doing anything. But I was fine with that. There was really nothing that I had to do.

Speaker 10
Did you hate dealing with people?

Speaker 7
More or less. But I didn't really care as much. However, I really hated my father. Why am I telling all of this to Kaoru?

Speaker 10
I think I may have been born just to meet you, Shinji Ikari. Humans cannot create from nothingness. Humans cannot accomplish anything without holding on to something. Humans are not gods.

Speaker 12
But there is one man who is trying to obtain the power of god. There is a man

Speaker 1
who

Speaker 12
is not one of us, who seeks to reopen Pandora's box. There is a man attempting to close the

Speaker 10
box before the hope at the bottom appears. The hope. You're saying this is the Lilim's hope?

Speaker 12
Hope exists in as many forms as there are people. For the human heart is the only place where hope exists. However, our hope is becoming substantiated. That is Lilith, the progenitor of mankind, the false successors from the Black Moon. And also Adam, progenitor of the Angels, who are the true successors from the Lost White Moon. His salvaged soul exists only within you. Yet his resurrected body exists within Ikari. Shinji's

Speaker 10
father.

Speaker 12
So he also is the same as me. That is so. And that is why we entrust you with our wish.

Speaker 10
All of this I know. Is that not why I am here after all? It's no good.

Speaker 6
I can't read his lips from all the way up here. But going out at the crack of dawn just to talk to himself is pretty suspicious. He noticed me? That's impossible.

Speaker 10
All will be as the

Speaker 5
Lilum directed.

Speaker 6
Well, did you get the data on him?

Speaker 5
Yeah, this is it. I sort of borrowed it from Lieutenant Ibuki without asking. I'm

Speaker 6
sorry that I made you do something like that. What is this? Yeah,

Speaker 5
it's no wonder that Maya can't talk about this. It's not even theoretically possible.

Speaker 6
Yeah, it's getting more and more mysterious. How can he set his sync ratio at any level he chooses? I guess it's time to go Maverick again. It's you again.

Speaker 8
How surprising.

Speaker 6
I have a question for you.

Speaker 8
Our conversation is being monitored, you know. I don't care. The fifth child, what is he? He is probably the last angel.

Speaker 10
It is time. Let us go, Adam Stark's shadow, servant of the Lilum.

Speaker 14
Ava Unit 2 just activated! That's impossible! Where's Asuka? She's in room 303! I've confirmed it! Who the hell is piloting it? It's unmanned! The entry plug hasn't even been

Speaker 9
inserted into Unit 2!

Speaker 6
Unmanned?

Speaker 14
Then the fifth child isn't there? AT field detected in Central Dogma! Ava 2? No, the blood pattern is blue! It's definitely an angel! It's an angel? No! That means that Ritz goes. The target has passed through the fourth defensive layer and is still descending. It's no good! We can't cut the power to the linear carriage!

Speaker 11
Evacuate the area! Seal all shatters and bulkheads surrounding Central Dogma. We've got to buy ourselves some more time.

Speaker 15
Closing all bulkheads

Speaker 4
immediately! All personnel

Speaker 5
and athletes! All personnel and athletes! God have mercy. Saleh has sent an angel to us. The

Speaker 4
old man wants to advance his schedule using us as his tools.

Speaker 12
Humans forget their foolishness and repeat their mistakes. If humans do not redeem themselves willingly, they will not change. We must not rely on Adam or the angels.

Speaker 13
We have no

Speaker 12
choice but to make changes with our own hands. I pray that Unit 1 will accomplish its task.

Speaker 14
Unit 2 has penetrated the armored shutters! Target has penetrated the second barrier, sir!

Speaker 4
Send unit one in to pursue it.

Speaker 14
Yes, sir.

Speaker 4
Under all circumstances, the last angel must be kept from entering Terminal Dogma.

Speaker 6
But why did the angel take unit two?

Speaker 4
You don't think it's going to attempt to fuse with unit two, do you? Or will it try to bring about our total destruction?

Speaker 6
No! No! No!

Speaker 9
It's not possible! I won't believe that

Speaker 10
Kauru's an angel! It's a lie!

Speaker 6
It's a fact, Shinji. You must accept it. Prepare for combat, do you understand?

Speaker 10
Shinji, you are late.

Speaker 14
Any Unit 1 descending via access route 2. It's about to make contact with the target. You betrayed me! You betrayed the trust I placed in you!

Speaker 15
You betrayed me just like my father did! Unit 1 has reached the fourth layer. It's about to confront the target. There he is!

Speaker 10
I've been waiting for you, Shinji.

Speaker 15
GAURU!

Speaker 10
Asuka,

Speaker 7
I'm sorry.

Speaker 10
The Ava series was born from Adam, born from man's antithesis. And yet the Lilum will utilize that which they hate most in order to survive. I do not understand.

Speaker 15
Skaru, stop! Why is this happening?

Speaker 10
Your Avas and I are composed of the same matter, born from Adam. I can synchronize with it easily as long as there is no dominant soul. Unit 2's soul is now hiding itself. Thus, Ava 2 is mine. No!

Speaker 7
You've got your own AT field?

Speaker 10
Yes. At least that is what Yulilam called this thing. This is the light of my soul. A sacred territory in which no one may intrude. Aren't Yulilam even aware that your AT field is merely that wall that encloses every mind that exists?

Speaker 15
I don't understand what you're talking about! Both

Speaker 10
Avas have penetrated all

Speaker 6
the way down

Speaker 14
to the final layer! 20 seconds until

Speaker 6
the target reaches track. If Unit 1's signals cut off or disappears, or if any other change should occur for the worse.

Speaker 5
I know. I'll initiate the self-destruct for this entire facility. It's better than letting third impact take place.

Speaker 6
I'm sorry.

Speaker 5
It's all right. Dying beside you wouldn't be a bad way to go out.

Speaker 6
Thank you.

Speaker 10
This is mankind's fate. The thread of human hope is spun with the flecks of sorrow.

Speaker 14
What the hell is that? It's

Speaker 13
another AT

Speaker 14
field, the strongest we've ever detected! It's shutting

Speaker 13
out everything!

Speaker 14
Light, magnetism, subatomic particles!

Speaker 9
It's blocking everything out? I can't sense anything! The targets, Unit 2, Unit 1, they're all gone! We've lost communication with the pilot!

Speaker 5
*Bang* They've reached it. Heaven's door is opening.

Speaker 6
Then the angel has finally reached its goal. Get ready.

Speaker 15
Enough! What's that? What's going on? It's another AT field. A field as strong as the first one has appeared around Terminal Dogma. He's right! It's breaking through the other AT field! What is it? Another angel? I don't know. I can't confirm it. God! It just disappeared! Disappeared? The angel?

Speaker 10
Adam, that from which we came. Must one who was born from Adam return to Adam, even though it would destroy man? But wait, this isn't... Lilith? I see. I understand now. The Lilum! Lilith! I thank you, friend Shinji. I wanted you to stop Unit 2 and take her from me. Otherwise, with her, I might have survived much longer.

Speaker 7
Karu, but why?

Speaker 10
It is my destiny to live forever, though my survival will bring destruction to the human race. However, it is possible for me to be killed, and whether I live or die makes no great difference. In truth, death may be the only absolute freedom there is.

Speaker 7
What are you? Garu? I don't understand what you are talking about, Garu!

Speaker 10
This is my wish. Please, destroy me. Otherwise, you will be destroyed. Only one life form Everyone can be chosen to evade the destruction and seize the future. And you are not the existence which should die. You need the future. It's what you live for. Thank you, Shinji. My life was meaningful because of you.

Speaker 7
Amen, amen. The End I've never felt such kindness before. He was like me. And he was like Ayanami. I liked him too. Kauru should have survived. He was much better than I am. Kauru should have survived, not me. He deserved to live.

Speaker 6
No! The one who deserves to survive is the one who has the will to make it happen. He wished for death. He ignored his will to survive and chose to die for a false hope. Your survival is not a mistake, Shinji.

Speaker 7
Misato, how can you be so cruel? Oh.

Speaker 16
The Last Angel is gone, but Shinji's heart is filled with torment. Misato and Asuka find their souls laid bare seeking the help of others as they search for salvation. Acceptance becomes a means to an end in the next episode, the Ending World. world.
