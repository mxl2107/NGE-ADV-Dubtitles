That's the automated defense system's kinetic weapon.

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,120
Not a problem.

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,600
Multiple

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
An anti-AT field!

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,320
Or you a little prick!

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,320
Damn it!

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,140
Screw this!

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,500
Help it!

66
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,460
Fine crony!

67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
Quit that singing! You're kissing me off!

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,500
Some cover, Fire! You're two seconds late!

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,920
Then you shouldn't move into position three seconds early.

70
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,540
I'm going with a plus

71
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,420
improvise!

72
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,980
Damn it. The Princess beckons.

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,380
Your noble wish is my commit.

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,080
I've cleared the Fullerene Shift.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,260
Reaching Final Defense is Area 89.

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,840
The

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,720
target object is

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,040
moving!

79
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,160
Hey!

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,540
Hospital Correction can't keep up!

81
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,120
I'm gonna go for a drop!

82
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,980
Decelerating!

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:47,820
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, burn complete!

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,760
Fon 2 dash has jettison final boosters.

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,480
Minimum safe re-entry window secure.

86
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,880
Target seized and secure.

87
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,580
Ready to return Roger

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,300
we'll be waiting at the retrieval point

89
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,620
We're just about to attend three entry here

90
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,800
Boy, crony, cover me!

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,060
Sorry, no can do.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,420
I've got insufficient altitude and I'm out of here.

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,400
You'll have to get your own back on this one.

94
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,180
Good luck.

95
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,120
Thanks for nothing.

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Damn persistent jerk! This wasn't part of the mission briefing!

97
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,440
What is this, boy?

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,780
The AT field is a neutralizing engine!

99
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,480
I have got to take out that damn core block!

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,740
Where are you going? Come back here!

101
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,520
- Caution! The high angle of attack is ending. - Dammit!

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,300
I can't maintain my angle of descent!

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
At this rate, my aim is gonna burn up!

104
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,420
Two dash! Operational objective has top priority.

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,000
Do not release the target object!

106
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,320
Even if it means losing the agent, you don't think I know that already?!

107
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,560
Come on!

108
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,940
Do something, anything!

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,300
Idiot Shinji!

110
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,440
Please!

111
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,340
I've been waiting for you, Shinji Ikari.

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,720
Welcome home.

113
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,240
All cardio functions appear normal.

114
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,220
No signs of paralysis either.

115
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,740
Yes, his eyes are open.

116
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
Can you understand what I'm saying to you?

117
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,800
Where am I?

118
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,400
What's going on?

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,160
He's speaking clearly.

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,860
Seems fully cognizant.

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,520
I think I...

122
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,200
I

123
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,660
saved Ray, didn't I?

124
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,220
Yes.

125
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,220
He's exhibiting signs of a continuity of memory.

126
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,480
Um, is Ray here?

127
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,600
Do you recognize this person?

128
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,080
Uh, what?

129
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,620
You mean me?

130
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,520
He's self-aware.

131
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,000
He seems to be fine.

132
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
What's on my neck?

133
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Do you feel comfortable or you should urinate?

134
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,220
Cargo loading 86% of ship.

135
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,640
N2 reactor in operation.

136
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,740
Maintain output at 90%.

137
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,160
No service

138
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,260
contact within a radius of 12.

139
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,520
Manly open the pressure vent.

140
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,620
Sky's all clear as well.

141
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,080
You don't have to

142
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,640
worry about the defense.

143
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,400
Make the D-block ship to the top priority.

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,940
We don't have enough

145
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,539
manpower

146
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,539
on the food restock.

147
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,080
Initializing gyro.

148
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,940
Get some more people on it.

149
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,320
ASAP.

150
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,380
Stabilizers show all green.

151
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,080
Workflow status for outfitting the ship.

152
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,659
Armament work is behind schedule by 3%.

153
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,979
There.

154
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,920
Subject, BM-03, now in custody.

155
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
Roger, undo the restraints.

156
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,200
You may leave now.

157
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,140
Unit number

158
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,280
106, supply operation.

159
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,020
-

160
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,660
-

161
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,960
-

162
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,200
- Check the wiring of the synchronized gun directors.

163
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,900
Number three in reporting errors.

164
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,460
- Misato?

165
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,100
- Shinji Ikari.

166
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,760
Can we call him that?

167
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,360
- Yes.

168
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,700
According to the physical analysis, he's a perfect match to the third child.

169
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,960
Every last detail, even his dental work, is an exact biological reproduction of him at N3I.

170
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,160
The deep synchronization test results are still being processed, though.

171
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
And what about the DSS Joker?

172
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,420
It's already been applied, Captain Katsuragi.

173
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,280
Captain Katsuragi?

174
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,680
So you are Misato.

175
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,620
What the...

176
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,800
It's operational.

177
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,440
And it's set to the captain's access code.

178
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,540
Understood.

179
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,080
What is this thing?

180
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,960
Will you please get it off of me?

181
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,440
Please?

182
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,380
You will never be allowed to take it off.

183
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,440
Not ever.

184
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,940
The interview's over.

185
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,760
Take him to quarantine.

186
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,660
Decoy 0-1 and 0-5 lost.

187
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,100
Wave

188
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,720
pattern detected.

189
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,840
Huh, what is that thing?

190
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,460
It's another pattern blue.

191
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,720
Target ID'd. Code 4C.

192
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,860
The Nemesis

193
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,200
Series.

194
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
They don't give up.

195
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,620
It's widening its formation.

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,980
All sides. They must want to pen us in before it attacks.

197
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
We're not ready to move yet.

198
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,400
Halt all operations except main engine outfitting.

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,980
All hands.

200
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,580
Battle stations condition 2.

201
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,820
Target all Nemesis Series entities.

202
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Roger. All hands.

203
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,100
Battle stations condition 2.

204
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,920
Ready. AAA anti-surface, anti-sub.

205
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,480
Stats! Halt all supply ops! Crew transfer gets priority.

206
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,760
Ready anti-air, anti

207
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,060
-surface, anti-submersible ordnance systems!

208
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,320
Ready remote-controlled gun turrets and torpedo launch tubes!

209
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,600
All aircraft clear out of current airspace immediately.

210
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,620
Please proceed to assembly area.

211
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,840
Be all of the loaded cargo. Transfer of crew gets top priority.

212
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
Continue operations to element the ship.

213
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,140
Keep the assembly work going right up until we engage the enemy.

214
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,500
All turrets, prepare to fire.

215
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,520
Remote control activated. Initiating SDS system. Prepare for sudden engagement.

216
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,840
Hurry! Continue supplying power to the main engine conductors.

217
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,120
Crank it up. N2 reactor at 99%.

218
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,780
Continuing power injection. Vals up to number 90 have been opened.

219
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,500
Power pipeline connected.

220
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,340
N2

221
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,000
reactor first. Number three

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,340
and number four. All green.

223
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:43,780
Roger.

224
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,200
Vals up to number 90 have all been opened. Resuming power injection.

225
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,600
Power supply

226
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,020
to the

227
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,080
N2 reactor. APU is holding steady.

228
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,820
Insecting LCL circulation pumps.

229
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,880
Checking filtration.

230
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,640
Battle stations.

231
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,660
That means now, people.

232
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,780
You there, get it in

233
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,140
gear.

234
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
We're doing the best we can here, Chief.

235
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,040
We've got a makeshift crew,

236
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,980
and half these guys are civvies with no training.

237
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,820
Give us a break.

238
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,720
No excuses.

239
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,460
Run your station, not your mouth.

240
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,220
Damn whiners.

241
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,420
I hate these young men.

242
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,120
Let's

243
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,280
see.

244
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,520
Outfitting operations are suspended.

245
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,960
So next, close the bulkheads?

246
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,660
Is that it?

247
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,120
Okay, so aerial attacks show up here, and here's the sonar.

248
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,740
Kotakami, how's the deck maintenance coming?

249
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,540
The deck? I'm not in charge of that too, am I?

250
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,620
Yeah, among other things. Get to it!

251
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,080
What? Seriously?

252
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,280
There we go.

253
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,220
It won't be safe to

254
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,000
transport you.

255
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,780
We'll just stay put for now, okay?

256
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,740
Wow, to be here on the bridge during a

257
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,380
battle alert?

258
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,860
Talk about exciting!

259
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,380
All anti-air systems. Protect Unit 1 at all costs.

260
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,780
Unit one?

261
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,680
It's here!

262
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,300
Target pillars of light confirmed!

263
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,540
Um,

264
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,420
it looks like their numbers are increasing!

265
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,200
Unable to detect target's core blocks, it's most likely concealed within its camouflage cocoon.

266
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,340
This is serious. If we stay here, they're going to overwhelm us.

267
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,020
T-minus 600 seconds to contact!

268
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,520
Captain Katsuragi, I propose that we immediately disperse the fleet.

269
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,420
We're understaffed and our crew is inexperienced.

270
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,420
The ship isn't even fully outfitted.

271
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,140
And unless we're able to get a fix on those core blocks, we'll be fighting blind.

272
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,740
In other words, we have a 0% chance of winning.

273
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,440
Our only option is to retreat.

274
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
There's no other choice.

275
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,420
Captain Katsuragi!

276
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,060
We stop running.

277
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,480
We change the game and stop second-guessing ourselves.

278
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,700
XO, let's fly.

279
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,840
Wait, why? You don't mean not the main engine.

280
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,880
Oh, personnel,

281
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,340
prepare for takeoff.

282
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,080
Pride, main engine!

283
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:53,960
What?

284
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,820
Taking this ship into combat is complete madness, Captain.

285
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,160
I agree. We still need a test run.

286
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,200
It's too dangerous.

287
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,640
I have no experience with gravity control, and I'm not optimistic.

288
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,840
Can we stick to fighting battles we can win?

289
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,020
I'm not quite ready to die yet.

290
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,320
Nobody's ready to die when they die, kid.

291
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
I'd rather burn out than fade away.

292
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,420
What?

293
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,680
How did you get this old making decisions like that?

294
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,080
Damn the risks.

295
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,140
We will use the ship as bait to draw out the target.

296
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,340
Time we find out if this ship is capable of deicide.

297
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,600
But the ignition system hasn't even been installed yet.

298
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,860
Unless you're using an

299
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,140
Ava.

300
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,360
Mari?

301
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,060
Unit eight still not ready.

302
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,000
Asuka.

303
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,260
Asuka?

304
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

305
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,100
All I've got to do is punch the igniter in there, right?

306
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,720
It's up to you.

307
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,140
But the

308
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,940
containment field is dangerously strong near the main engine.

309
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,840
And your Ava is still being refitted.

310
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,560
Eh, whatever.

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,740
Like the Colonel always says, mission first, safety last.

312
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,800
No time to worry about it.

313
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,880
Unit two improved.

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,720
Go!

315
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,040
Ava, unit

316
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,660
two high.

317
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,120
Launch.

318
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,780
Roger. Unit two

319
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,320
improved in process of launching.

320
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,140
Next.

321
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,300
Motoring underwater motor and left container number one.

322
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:05,980
Drop.

323
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,520
Man, they give me this awesome new decked out unit,

324
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,940
and then they put me on maintenance duty.

325
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,340
It really is Unit 2.

326
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,900
Thank goodness.

327
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,360
Asuka pulled through.

328
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,360
Misato, what about me?

329
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,540
All hands, condition one, battle stations.

330
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,140
All

331
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,240
hands, condition one, battle stations.

332
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,800
I repeat, all hands. Condition one battle stations.

333
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,500
Engaging battle command system.

334
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,580
Essential personnel to battle bridge.

335
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Prepare gravity ballasts for launch.

336
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,520
Roger. Now checking ventilation.

337
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,340
Centralized main ship controls in the anchoring plug.

338
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,140
Roger. Preparing for descent.

339
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,900
Injector, check. Starting countdown.

340
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,840
Ready, Kiernstam

341
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,500
tower movement.

342
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,120
Misato, put me in! Where's Unit 1?

343
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,340
I'll pilot it! Let me help Asuka!

344
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,440
You do need me to pilot it, don't you?

345
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,620
Misato!

346
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,300
You're

347
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,900
wrong. We have no need for you to pilot an Ava.

348
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,100
You have no need for me?

349
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,880
But then, what else can I do to help?

350
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,660
Misato!

351
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,320
Misato!

352
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,380
Listen closely, Shinji.

353
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,220
From this moment on, you do nothing.

354
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,360
LCL gas build. Ionization density reached.

355
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,500
Start entry sequence.

356
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,040
LCL ionization state is normal.

357
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,020
Initiating all processing systems.

358
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,640
Status. Personnel headcount complete.

359
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,220
Crew transfer confirmed.

360
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,500
Primary launch checklist complete.

361
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,240
Closure of all bulkheads confirmed. Pressure check complete.

362
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,020
APU power output increasing.

363
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,699
Ignition

364
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,839
power in section to main engineering completion.

365
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,439
Five percent to threshold.

366
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,880
Initializing gyro compass. Stabilizers show all green.

367
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,500
Initiating visual display data processing. Activating main monitor.

368
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,060
Target still inbound. It's taking up an encircling formation.

369
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,500
Unit to improve now discarding UPV.

370
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,820
Switching out left arm.

371
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
It's showtime.

372
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,320
Yeah.

373
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,140
All right, then.

374
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,780
Let's do this.

375
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,500
AT field, deploy.

376
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,160
Shift and pillars of light.

377
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
Energy levels are rapidly increasing.

378
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,140
Entire formation closing in.

379
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
We lost a cruiser! Vaporized!

380
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,400
It's

381
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
a full-on blitz.

382
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,800
If it makes it to the ship, it's all over.

383
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,860
T-minus 360 seconds to contact.

384
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,320
Here goes nothing!

385
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,500
Unit 2 improved. Pracking ignition.

386
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,420
Injection pressure at 300%.

387
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,360
Ignore it! Direct all energy to the flywheel.

388
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,620
Priority one!

389
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,240
The seventh converter array has exploded!

390
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,120
Disregard the lines that have gone down.

391
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
Continue the forced injection.

392
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,120
Just ignore the damn pressure gauges.

393
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Releasing pressure plate lock on flywheel.

394
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,960
Beginning rotation!

395
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,540
Main engine energy pump now operating.

396
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,720
Adjusting APU rotation power to 80%.

397
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,220
Drive in the cantilegation.

398
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,980
That just leaves.

399
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,360
T-minus 35 seconds.

400
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,680
Rotation rate increasing.

401
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:37,940
Unit

402
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,840
to improve an ignition position.

403
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,020
We've hit critical.

404
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Flywheel energy at 102%.

405
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,460
Threshold reach.

406
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,520
Main engine priming.

407
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,420
Final stage.

408
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,440
Roger. Change helm systems.

409
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,020
Roger.

410
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,660
Time-space controls.

411
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,820
Switching to tri-axis helm systems.

412
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,760
Simultaneously deploy AT field with ignition.

413
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,820
36,000 RPM. All green.

414
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,140
Reactor contact. All green.

415
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,740
Skip countdown! Initiate contact!

416
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,100
Engage now!

417
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,640
Ignition!

418
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,680
Flight path, all clear!

419
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,140
All sectors check in! Evacuate escort ships!

420
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,860
Here we go.

421
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,480
Volnder, lift off!

422
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,160
*Eight rings penetrating! Damage unknown!

423
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,880
Never mind! Annihilate the enemy! Pitch down 90 degrees! Go astern!

424
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,120
Go astern! Aye aye, Captain!

425
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,260
DRAG THE CORN BLOCKS INTO THE OPEN!

426
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,140
HOLD THEM OUT OF THE CAMOUFULOUS COCOON!

427
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,260
VISSERS HOLDING IN RIGHT MAIN WINGPAPE!

428
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,480
HAL, MAINTAIN COURSE! TACA HOLD, GIVE ME FULL POWER!

429
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,000
ALL BACK SLOW!

430
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,160
MAXIMUM BATTLESPEED!

431
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,400
We got it!

432
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
The core blocks!

433
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,060
Now!

434
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,060
Turn hard to port! Swing them around!

435
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,540
Roger!

436
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,380
Emergency stock! Full thrusters!

437
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,440
Target inactive!

438
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,180
Main guns, prepare to fire!

439
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,800
Load energy AP routes. All turrets enable direct feed for main engine. Engage reload circuit!

440
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,440
Roger! Circuits engaged!

441
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,620
Refining measurements,

442
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,100
pinpointing max accuracy!

443
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,760
Range keeper synchronization on!

444
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,160
All turrets still have direct visual targeting. Manual tracking enabled.

445
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,980
That's good enough!

446
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:23,960
Fire!

447
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,800
Targets annihilated.

448
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,300
All stations, stand down to condition two.

449
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,340
Prepare to retrieve unit two improved.

450
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,340
Expedite repairs to main wings.

451
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,000
Amazing.

452
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,080
Wow, we

453
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,980
actually won.

454
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,960
That was absolutely insane.

455
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,040
Kaji said she was nuts, but I think he sold her short.

456
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,100
So this is the God Slayer's power.

457
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,200
Wunder.

458
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,660
A fitting name for a ship of hope.

459
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,220
*Loud

460
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:42,620
sound*

461
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:58,080
Subject BM-03. Tentative name Shinji Ikari. The XO is here to explain some things.

462
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,880
That's

463
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,700
Unit 1?

464
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,980
Correct. Unit 1 is being utilized as the main engine for this ship, which is why we don't need a pilot anymore.

465
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,320
I guess you really don't need me.

466
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,160
Also, your deep synchronization test results have come in.

467
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,100
The synchronization rate is 0.00.

468
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,660
Even if you did board an Ava, it wouldn't activate.

469
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,180
That's wonderful.

470
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,580
Isn't that great, Mr. Hikari?

471
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,680
Despite this, we cannot overlook the fact that you went into a state of awakening for 12 seconds earlier.

472
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,800
To avoid further incident, we've equipped you with a DSS choker.

473
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,620
Which is what exactly?

474
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,100
Call it an insurance policy.

475
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,940
It's a safety device that suppresses any potential awakening from occurring.

476
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,720
A symbol of our distrust.

477
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,360
And your punishment as well.

478
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,400
What do you mean, my punishment?

479
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,860
If you're ever to board an Ava while wearing that,

480
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,960
and your emotions begin to inexorably consume you to the threshold of an awakening,

481
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,180
that contingency will be suppressed at the cost of your life.

482
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,000
So that means...

483
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:05,700
You're saying it will kill me?

484
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,400
I won't deny it.

485
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,520
But that's... you'd...

486
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,160
Misato, you'd really let me die?

487
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,160
What the hell is going

488
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,740
on here?

489
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,380
This is so messed up, it doesn't make any sense!

490
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,740
I know this must be disorienting. Lieutenant?

491
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,820
Yes, ma'am.

492
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,520
State your name and rank to him.

493
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,280
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,780
It's, um, kind of late for this,

495
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,900
but I'm your attending medical officer.

496
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,520
Second Lieutenant Sakura Suzahara.

497
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,260
It's nice meeting you.

498
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,780
Oh, likewise.

499
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,420
Wait, Suzahara?

500
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,600
Toji's...

501
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,040
Yep. Thanks for being such a good friend to my brother.

502
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm his little sister, Sakura.

503
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
His little sister? Don't you mean older?

504
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
Nope. I'm younger.

505
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,100
But that doesn't... How could you...

506
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,860
Because it's been 14 years since you've opened your dumb eyes.

507
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,100
Idiot, Shinji.

508
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,600
Asuka!

509
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,840
Thank goodness. I was so worried about you.

510
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,940
But you're okay.

511
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,300
I can't do it.

512
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,640
It won't stay back.

513
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,400
I can't hold it in any longer.

514
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,340
You can't

515
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,000
hold what in?

516
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,540
A whole lot of pent-up anger and sorrow.

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,460
I don't understand what you're...

518
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,360
Wait, Asuka, your left eye.

519
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,980
It's none of your damn business.

520
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,180
Asuka.

521
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,420
If 14 years have passed, how come you haven't changed except for your eye?

522
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,200
The curse. The curse of the Avas.

523
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,280
What does that mean?

524
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,360
Wait a minute! You gotta tell me!

525
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,180
Please! Please just tell me where Rey is!

526
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,840
No idea.

527
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,400
What do you mean, no idea?

528
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,360
I saved her! I know I did!

529
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,540
It doesn't even matter if you did.

530
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,700
We don't have time to worry about one measly person anymore.

531
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,000
Not in this world.

532
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,340
Isn't that right?

533
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,820
Colonel Katsuragi

534
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,420
Asuka!

535
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,200
Misato, tell me where Rei is

536
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,420
Please tell me!

537
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,740
If you must know

538
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,700
Rei Ayanami no longer exists in this world

539
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,760
That can't...

540
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,800
I know for a fact I saved her

541
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,060
She's probably still inside Unit 1's plug

542
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,240
You've got to check

543
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
she's in there

544
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,300
Shinji, we carefully searched every single inch of Unit 1

545
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,780
The only things left inside were you and this

546
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,160
We don't know why, but this was reconstructed.

547
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,660
The tests we ran on it were clean, so you can have it back.

548
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,540
This was my father's.

549
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,660
Ray had it on board with her.

550
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,300
Which means I must have saved her.

551
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,140
What's happening?

552
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,080
Talk to me.

553
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,800
The target's on the afterdeck. It just latched onto

554
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,040
us.

555
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,960
This must be the real deal.

556
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,320
All hands, Condition One, battle stations.

557
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,780
- Our tactic unit for the priority!

558
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,580
- Unit! Are you back in the game?

559
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,940
You bet

560
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,380
I am.

561
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,220
I'm on

562
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,280
it,

563
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,820
your highness.

564
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,800
But first things first, how was our little puppy?

565
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,220
Did he sit like a good little boy?

566
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,980
He's the exact same! Same stupid face topped with bedhead!

567
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,200
That goofy face of him, that's what you wanted to see, Brian.

568
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,980
Shut up! I went there to bat him one! And I feel better!

569
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:28,860
Misato!

570
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,660
Ritsuko! Tell me what's happening! Is it an angel attack?

571
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,580
Shinji Ikari, where are you?

572
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,120
That was Rey. Did you hear that?

573
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,940
That was Rey's voice! Risa!

574
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,400
Come on, what the hell?

575
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,480
We're ready, Mr. Ikari. You need to come with me.

576
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,140
Tell me, Shinji, where are you?

577
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,740
That is Rey.

578
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,280
Rey's looking for me!

579
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,140
Mr. Ikari, please hurry!

580
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,500
I've had enough.

581
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,700
Rey! I'm here!

582
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,040
Dammit! The central soldier!

583
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,100
This is the current attack.

584
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,840
Why the hell should I be, Sato?

585
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,540
You made it very clear that you don't need me!

586
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Regardless, you're to remain in our custody!

587
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,180
Why? Just because you say so?

588
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,240
Stop it! Why are you letting them shoot an Eva?

589
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
Because it's an Eva! We'll destroy every last one of Nerve's Eva's.

590
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,260
Nerve's Eva's? But isn't this a part of Nerve 2?

591
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,640
No, we are Vilea. Our whole objective is to annihilate Nerve.

592
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,860
But that's... No!

593
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,080
Don't you realize that's Reya there?

594
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,140
It's not. I told you she no

595
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,940
longer exists.

596
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,580
You're lying!

597
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,900
She's there! Inside Unit Zero!

598
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,720
How can you be so blind? Just forget it!

599
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,120
No! Wait!

600
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,320
Do whatever you think is best!

601
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,840
As long as you never get in an A-bug!

602
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,600
I'm begging you, just anything but that!

603
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,020
Don't let him escape, all right, crony?

604
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,980
Sure thing, boss.

605
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:45,500
When I set my sights on a target, I never miss.

606
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,240
All right, come on.

607
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,780
How do you like that?

608
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
Is this the vessel of the atoms?

609
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,160
Hey, I'm talking to you! Come back here, jackass!

610
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,400
They didn't care about Unit 1, they just wanted him!

611
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,040
Which means they know he can still be used as the trigger!

612
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,560
Misato, use the choker now!

613
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,080
This is a director from the EXO. No need to pursue.

614
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,440
All personnel, resume emergency repairs and finish outfitting the ship.

615
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,160
Roger.

616
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,320
No need to pursue.

617
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,100
I've changed my mind.

618
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,140
He's not an idiot. He's a brat.

619
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,840
The

620
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:52,860
End

621
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,120
See, I knew I saved her, I knew it.

622
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
You lied, Misato.

623
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,080
Come with me.

624
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,740
So, um...

625
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,060
Isn't this the geofront?

626
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,120
Why can you see the sky?

627
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,120
Is that Nerve HQ?

628
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,620
What happened here?

629
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,220
She wasn't lying when she said 14 years have passed.

630
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,040
We're here.

631
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,700
What is that?

632
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,820
An Eva?

633
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,200
That's correct.

634
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Father?

635
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,740
This is Evangelion Unit 13.

636
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,740
You will share this unit with your co-pilot.

637
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,620
Weren't you the one playing the piano?

638
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,700
When the time comes, the two of you will pilot the Ava.

639
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,800
This talk is over.

640
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,060
Wait! Where are you going, Father?

641
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,920
I need to talk to you! Tell me what's going on here!

642
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:45,980
Father!

643
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,220
There's no dial pad.

644
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,420
I guess they only want me to receive calls then.

645
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:22,880
Oh, yeah.

646
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,080
I really need to go thank her.

647
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,700
Hey Ray!

648
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,220
Where are you?

649
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,540
Ray!

650
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,420
Ray!

651
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,540
Yay!

652
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,040
I wonder what this place is.

653
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,840
Is that Ray?

654
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,180
I didn't think I was going to find her.

655
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:28,820
Ray!

656
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,220
I've been looking everywhere.

657
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,280
Whoa!

658
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:32,900
Clothing!

659
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,940
Where are your...

660
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,320
Will you put some clothes on?

661
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,220
Is that an order?

662
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,380
I'm going to come in now.

663
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,500
Um, so, uh, I just wanted to say thanks for this.

664
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,860
Thanks for keeping it safe.

665
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,240
So I guess you got a new plug suit, huh?

666
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,920
Black is an interesting choice.

667
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,140
It's so strange.

668
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,640
Everything changed so much since yesterday.

669
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,020
None of this makes sense.

670
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,920
Why are Misato and the others fighting nerve now?

671
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,000
And what the hell is my dad up to?

672
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,780
And what happened to everyone?

673
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,100
Come on, Rey. Catch me up here.

674
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,660
I don't know.

675
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,920
I see.

676
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,760
I guess you wouldn't.

677
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,420
So, how did you make it out of Unit 1, anyway?

678
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,860
This place...

679
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,780
It's not even a proper room.

680
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,960
I know you've always been a minimalist, but still...

681
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,160
It's not like there's a school left.

682
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,480
So what do you do?

683
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,940
I wait for orders.

684
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,100
You don't even have any books.

685
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,840
Jeez, don't you get bored?

686
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,140
Books.

687
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,620
Does Rei Ayanami read books?

688
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:17,620
Yeah.

689
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,740
You used to read all the time.

690
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,040
You loved reading.

691
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,320
I see.

692
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,640
Tell you what, I'll try to find some books in the library and bring them to you.

693
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,900
Um, are English books okay?

694
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,280
You like those, right?

695
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,220
You always seem to have one with you.

696
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,060
Like?

697
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:33,880
Yeah.

698
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,500
At least I thought you did.

699
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,240
What is... like...

700
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,700
No word from Sele?

701
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,640
I take it they're still maintaining their silence?

702
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,520
The human instrumentality project will be enacted as per the Dead Sea Scrolls.

703
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,660
At this point, there is no further need for them to speak.

704
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,320
Ikari, do you intend to employ Unit 13 for the next mission?

705
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,140
Well, I...

706
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,660
No matter, I'll go along with whatever you have planned.

707
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,900
For Yui's sake, at least.

708
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,380
Huh.

709
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,520
I guess it's broken.

710
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,080
You do nothing.

711
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,700
It's none of your

712
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,560
damn business.

713
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,360
As long as you never get in an

714
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,740
Ava!

715
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,420
Pilot the Ava.

716
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,260
I don't know.

717
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,080
Why don't you come down here, Shinji?

718
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,160
Let's talk.

719
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,000
I thought you wanted to talk.

720
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,220
This isn't exactly what I thought you meant.

721
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,700
Playing piano with four hands is a conversation,

722
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,200
just in scales.

723
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,980
Yeah, but I don't think I can do this.

724
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,880
If you want to live your life,

725
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,680
you can't be afraid of the change

726
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,180
that comes with trying new things.

727
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,280
It's easy.

728
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,060
You just take your hands and use them to play these keys down here

729
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,260
Go on you've just got to jump in

730
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,860
This is great.

731
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,980
I like playing music with you.

732
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,320
Sounds are so much fun.

733
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,720
Isn't it nice what two people can do?

734
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,440
Thank you.

735
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,460
That's the first time I've had fun in forever.

736
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,820
Yeah, me too.

737
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,480
Let's do it again.

738
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,900
Anytime you want.

739
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,260
Sound good, Shinji?

740
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,080
What's your...

741
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,780
Kaworu Nagisa, I'm a child burdened with a predestined fate just like you.

742
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,120
She's still not here. And she didn't even touch the books.

743
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,860
Hey, good morning, Shinji.

744
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,780
You're here bright and early.

745
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,580
I don't really have anything else to do.

746
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,520
*music*

747
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,120
Are there any

748
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,860
techniques I can learn to get better?

749
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,420
Don't worry about playing well.

750
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:07,200
Just create sounds that feel good to you.

751
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,380
Well, I think what would feel good is if I could get better at playing.

752
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,120
Then keep practicing.

753
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,100
Just repeat the same thing over and over

754
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,420
until you're finally happy with the way it makes you feel.

755
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,460
That's all you can do.

756
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,840
*music*

757
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,200
Sure, no problem. I know I can get it working again.

758
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,840
Really? Thank you.

759
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,140
I feel bad asking you on top of everything else you've done.

760
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,000
Don't feel bad about it. We're friends, after all.

761
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,680
It's starting to get dark, huh?

762
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,240
Guess we should call it a day.

763
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,680
Hey, wait. Let's stay a little longer.

764
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,920
We can hang out and look at the stars.

765
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,020
The stars?

766
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,320
So you like looking at the stars.

767
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:26,760
Yeah.

768
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,160
Taking in the vastness

769
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,800
of this universe.

770
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,300
It's given me this feeling of serenity

771
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,180
ever since I was a little kid.

772
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,080
In 14 years, nothing out there has changed,

773
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,660
which is comforting.

774
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,740
It makes me feel like the things that happen to me

775
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,560
don't really matter,

776
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,900
and there's something peaceful about that.

777
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,440
I mean, if that even makes sense.

778
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,300
The sentiment came across just fine.

779
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,860
Shunning change.

780
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,200
You prefer the empty, indifferent world of the abyss.

781
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
That's so like you.

782
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,040
This is nice, the two of us lying here talking.

783
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,580
Who knew something so simple would feel so good?

784
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,620
Thank you for asking me to spend time with you.

785
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,460
Oh, no, it's nothing.

786
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,620
I just figured that, you know, that it might be fun to look at the stars.

787
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,340
It is fun.

788
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,940
I now realize I was born to meet you, Shinji.

789
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:41,980
That's different.

790
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,860
This one's a little big on me.

791
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,560
Here. It should work just fine.

792
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,040
Thank you.

793
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,440
You're amazing, Kaworu.

794
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,100
It's like you can do anything.

795
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,260
It's nothing but applied knowledge.

796
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,780
I've just had more time on this world

797
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,140
to pick these things up than you.

798
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,900
Well, it's still

799
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,280
amazing.

800
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,520
You seem rather deflated.

801
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,080
Is something wrong?

802
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,180
I just can't stop thinking about my friends.

803
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,600
Your old friends?

804
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:23,820
Yeah.

805
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,280
There used to be a city above Nerve headquarters,

806
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:28,520
and everyone

807
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,220
lived up there.

808
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,420
Toji and Kinsuke, all of my classmates.

809
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,740
I was apparently catatonic inside Unit 1 for an entire 14 years,

810
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,780
and everything changed.

811
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,100
It changed so much while I was in there.

812
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,320
and those changes are too much for you.

813
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,680
You're in pain.

814
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,400
I'm just kind of worried

815
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,420
of what's happened

816
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,340
to the city and everyone in it.

817
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,100
It's the not knowing,

818
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,220
the wondering.

819
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,440
It...

820
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,080
It scares me to death.

821
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,640
Do you want to know?

822
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,780
Oh, fuck!

823
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,620
Come on, we're almost there.

824
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,880
There'll be a break in the clouds,

825
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,400
and you'll get all of the answers you're looking for.

826
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,220
What is all this?

827
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,800
This is the result of your assimilation with Unit 1.

828
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,220
The result of the third impact.

829
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,600
You mean...

830
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,380
everyone I knew?

831
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,740
This planet is no stranger when it comes to mass extinctions.

832
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,660
They actually help to spur on evolution.

833
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:59,000
After all, most life forms transform themselves to adapt to the world.

834
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,440
The Lilin are unique in that regard.

835
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,680
They labor to transform the world instead of themselves.

836
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,640
They instituted a ritual that would expedite the process and artificially evolve them.

837
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:19,740
A ritual that sacrifices an older life form in order to give the fruit of life to a new one and make way for its reign.

838
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,060
It's a programmed extinction devised and pursued since ancient times.

839
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,320
Nerve labeled this ritual the Human Instrumentality Project.

840
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,060
The Nerve did this?

841
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,540
My father, what is he doing?

842
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,580
Listen, Shinji.

843
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,560
Once it awakened,

844
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,820
Ava Unit 1 opened the gates of Gaff,

845
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,640
and it became the catalyst for the third impact,

846
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,960
what the Lillan called the near third impact.

847
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
Someone brought all of this about.

848
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,460
You were the one.

849
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:01,900
No.

850
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,660
I didn't mean to.

851
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,120
I just...

852
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,980
I just wanted to save Ray.

853
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:09,420
Perhaps.

854
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,420
But you were still the trigger.

855
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,080
This can't be.

856
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,320
You can't put this on me.

857
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,740
You blame me for this, but I can't do anything about it.

858
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:23,920
You're right.

859
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,500
You can't do anything to change the past.

860
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,240
But this is the truth you wanted to know.

861
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:35,520
As a consequence, the Lilin have forced you to bear the wages of that sin.

862
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,640
Isn't that what this thing around your neck represents?

863
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:41,880
My sin?

864
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,800
I didn't do anything!

865
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,240
This has got nothing to do with me!

866
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,940
I'm afraid the others don't see it that way.

867
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,980
However, all sins can be atoned for.

868
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,700
There is still hope, Shi-ji.

869
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,080
There will always be hope.

870
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,020
The Sele boy seems to have made contact with the third child.

871
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,000
He's even revealed the outside world to him.

872
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,080
I can only imagine how he must be taking it.

873
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,240
You're okay with this, Ikari?

874
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,800
We'll take it upon ourselves to rewrite Sele's script.

875
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,520
The whole of existence is nothing more than a tool for revision.

876
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,080
And you feel opening up to your son,

877
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,560
telling him about your life's work won't help?

878
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
I can't honestly say I believe that.

879
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,220
Why did this happen?

880
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,680
Things weren't supposed to end up this way.

881
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,700
I mean, I saved Ray, didn't I?

882
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,960
Isn't that good

883
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,060
enough?

884
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,020
She's not here again.

885
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,600
She still hasn't read them.

886
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,120
What the hell? Ray too? How can she treat me this way?

887
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,660
Tell me, third child, do you know how to play Shogi?

888
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,540
Well, sure, I know the rules.

889
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:52,820
That's good enough.

890
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,840
Let's

891
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,660
play a game then.

892
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,800
I'll even spot you the rook and bishop.

893
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,340
You have to quiet your mind and make it calm.

894
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,220
It's a necessary task in order to win battles.

895
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,520
You have only 31 moves before you're in checkmate.

896
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,460
This should be more enjoyable.

897
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:31,240
Noel, thank you for taking the time to humor an old man with his hobby.

898
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,140
I'm easily daunted as well, you see.

899
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,560
Without some sort of pretext, I doubt I would have been able to speak with you like this.

900
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,500
Tell me, do you remember much of your mother?

901
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,120
No.

902
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,160
I was so little when she...

903
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,560
And then, my father, he got rid of all of her belongings.

904
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,840
She looks just like...

905
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,020
Is that Rey?

906
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,700
That woman is your mother.

907
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,240
Her name was Yui Ayanami.

908
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,780
She was a student of mine at the university.

909
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,440
And now she serves as the control system for Ava Unit 1.

910
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,740
It seems the power has finally been restored.

911
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,520
This is the prototype of the Ava's control system.

912
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,060
Yui devised the method of direct entry into the core,

913
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:36,260
and she attempted it with herself as the test subject in this very system.

914
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,940
You watched it happen, too, although your memories have since been erased.

915
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,560
Upon entry, she disappeared within the system.

916
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,820
All that remains of her is the data used for the Ayanami series.

917
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:59,860
The Rei Ayanami that you came to know was nothing more than a replicant of your mother.

918
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,160
And like your mother before her, that girl is now stored and within the system of Unit 1.

919
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,760
And it's all part of your father's plan.

920
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,520
This can't be true.

921
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,360
It's shocking how simple it is to tear the world apart.

922
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,580
Although, rebuilding it from scratch is not so easy.

923
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:26,220
Like time itself, the course of the world cannot be reversed, nor can people's hearts.

924
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:35,020
Which is why, in order to make his wish come true, Ikari is making a bounty of sacrifices, including his very own soul.

925
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,240
I felt it was only right that you know some of the truth, and to know about your father.

926
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,520
Such a painfully unpleasant role.

927
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:57,440
Yui.

928
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,800
I hope this is what you wanted.

929
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,300
The time of the final covenant is near.

930
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,980
We'll see each other soon, Yui.

931
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,160
Why haven't you read any of the books I've left for you?

932
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,480
I haven't been

933
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,140
ordered to.

934
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,640
Ordered to?

935
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,420
Then just forget it!

936
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,680
Tell me.

937
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,340
You are Rei, right?

938
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,720
Yes. Rei Ayanami.

939
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,400
Then I... I did save you, didn't I?

940
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,120
I don't know.

941
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,020
Shinji?

942
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,880
I didn't really save her.

943
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,200
I lost Rey.

944
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,500
Father.

945
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,960
Mother.

946
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,480
Misato.

947
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,740
What have I been doing

948
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,080
with

949
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,480
my life?

950
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,480
*Screams*

951
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,000
So, the final executor is at last complete.

952
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,660
Yes, we now possess all the

953
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,740
tools we need.

954
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,480
The moment has arrived.

955
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,100
It's finally time, Shinji Ikari.

956
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,760
I won't!

957
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,360
I'll never pilot an Eiba again!

958
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,760
I couldn't even save Rei!

959
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,700
Nothing good could come from piloting an Ava.

960
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,100
I'm done. I won't do it.

961
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,080
You hear me?

962
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,540
And replaying the same traumatic refrain in your mind over and over again?

963
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,080
What good can possibly come of that?

964
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,960
Nothing good comes from anything.

965
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,980
You were the one who showed it to me.

966
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,660
That lifeless red world.

967
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,780
The changes that were inflicted by an Ava can be changed once again with an Ava.

968
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,280
It doesn't matter.

969
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,420
Eva's father, Misato.

970
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,640
I can't trust anything anymore.

971
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,860
But you can trust me, Shinji.

972
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,380
I don't know that.

973
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,620
Misato and the others locked this thing around my neck.

974
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,480
I can't get it in Eva again.

975
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,220
They told me it'll kill me if I do.

976
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:57,000
I just don't want anything to do with Eva's.

977
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,540
I understand.

978
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,840
The Lilin's curse and the risk of an Eva awakening.

979
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,160
I'll bear this burden for you.

980
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,680
But Kawaro...

981
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,440
Don't let it bother you.

982
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,200
The Lilin actually made this choker because they were afraid of me.

983
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,080
I've been planning on doing this anyway.

984
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,560
Listen to me, Shinji.

985
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,920
Your only hope is to retrieve the two spears from the heart of Central Dogma.

986
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,420
They're the key to initiating the human instrumentality project.

987
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,240
The two of us can wield those spears.

988
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,120
Without them, Nerve will be incapable of triggering the fourth impact.

989
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:49,000
But in our hands, together with Unit 13, they will grant us the power to restore the world.

990
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,680
You're right.

991
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,040
Yeah.

992
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,200
I know you can pull it off.

993
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,260
But not by myself, with you.

994
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,060
Ava Unit 13 is equipped with a double-entry system.

995
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,640
Together, we can restore the hope of the Lillan.

996
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,220
And that's what you need most right now.

997
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,840
Above all else, you need hope.

998
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,900
Atonement and peace of mind will help you get that.

999
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,540
You're amazing.

1000
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,920
You really have me figured out.

1001
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,980
That's because the only thing I do is think about you.

1002
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,980
Kaoru, thank you.

1003
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,080
Of course. We're friends.

1004
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,680
Yeah. You really are a great friend.

1005
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,720
It'll be like playing the piano.

1006
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,940
Good things happen when we're together.

1007
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,500
Right, Shinji?

1008
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:47,640
Right.

1009
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,060
Let's go, Kaoru.

1010
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:51,100
I don't know.

1011
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,380
Evangelion Unit 13, go!

1012
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,140
It's the signal.

1013
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,180
A new avi unit has been activated.

1014
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,160
I thought this was just you and me.

1015
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,160
What, you mean Mark

1016
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,400
9?

1017
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,160
She's here for backup, just in case Vila tries to intervene.

1018
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:07,980
But why?

1019
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,760
We could handle them on our own.

1020
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,500
She's not even the real Rey.

1021
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,480
I'm not Rey, so I'm...

1022
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,180
The walls!

1023
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,080
Yes, the remains of those who fell short of infinity.

1024
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,740
It's nothing for you to worry about.

1025
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,500
We're almost at Lilith's seal.

1026
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,620
The main shaft is completely blocked by it.

1027
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:43,100
Not once in 14 years has it allowed anyone to pass it.

1028
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,020
Oh.

1029
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,940
It looks just like a giant lid.

1030
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,500
It'll be okay. Unit 13 was specifically designed to overcome it.

1031
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,460
The two of us can get past it.

1032
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,280
We need to be in sync, just like playing the piano together.

1033
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,120
All right, Shinji, here we go.

1034
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,140
*Squeak

1035
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,260
We made it.

1036
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,300
The lowest level of central dogma.

1037
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,920
The epicenter of the third impact.

1038
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,140
Is that Lilith?

1039
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,780
What remains of her.

1040
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,900
You're looking at her corpse.

1041
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,360
Poor Misato.

1042
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,100
She risked her life to protect it.

1043
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,160
Is that an Ava?

1044
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:27,780
It

1045
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,120
is.

1046
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,020
What's

1047
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,180
left of Ava Mark VI.

1048
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,840
The Lilin modified it to be autonomous.

1049
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,340
And that's the wreckage left from their attempt.

1050
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,460
Those things sticking out of Lilith.

1051
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:43,920
That's what we're here for?

1052
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,180
Exactly.

1053
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,160
Bonginus and Cassius.

1054
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,720
Removing them requires two souls.

1055
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,120
That's the only way they can even be retrieved.

1056
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,880
Hence the necessity of the double entry system.

1057
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,620
Well, if that's all,

1058
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,160
couldn't she just as easily have taken my place?

1059
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:00,860
Not at all.

1060
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,980
A replica can't take a Lilin's place.

1061
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,700
Its soul resides in a different place than ours.

1062
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,880
Now then, let's begin.

1063
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,440
Hold on a second.

1064
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:18,460
Something's off.

1065
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,200
What's the matter, Kaworu?

1066
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,259
This isn't right.

1067
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,580
They seem to have shifted in form.

1068
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:27,920
They're matching now.

1069
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,839
Let's just hurry and pull them out.

1070
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,100
That's what we came down here for now, isn't it?

1071
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,000
Let's...

1072
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,520
What the hell is going on?

1073
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,220
Unit 2?

1074
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:49,759
Asuka!

1075
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,020
What are you doing?

1076
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,259
Stop, Asuka!

1077
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:57,839
Idiot,

1078
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:58,420
Shinji!

1079
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,100
Don't tell me you're dumb enough to pilot Naeva!

1080
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,180
I guess I am.

1081
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,080
But it's different.

1082
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:04,819
I'm gonna change the world!

1083
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,080
You damn brat!

1084
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,160
Haven't you changed enough?

1085
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:17,240
Late

1086
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,080
again! Can

1087
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,500
you try to be on time?

1088
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:20,259
My bad!

1089
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,940
Well, hello there, vessel of the atoms.

1090
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,160
I know I can't blow your head off, but I can at least keep you on the ground.

1091
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,319
*Bang*

1092
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,180
You've already caused one impact!

1093
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,460
Listen to me!

1094
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,440
With those spears, we can redo everything!

1095
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,520
We can save the world with them!

1096
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,460
You are so damn naive.

1097
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,660
You just don't get it!

1098
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,560
How about a little help, Kaworu?

1099
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,400
Cassius and Longinus.

1100
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,900
It's imperative we get both Spears.

1101
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,440
But these two look identical, like they're one and the same.

1102
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,340
Hey, come on!

1103
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,860
So that's it.

1104
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,800
Now I understand.

1105
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,380
Lillan!

1106
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,500
Hey, little Miss Provisional Sailor Pilot.

1107
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:51,300
You can hear me, right?

1108
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,080
I think about getting out of that Ava

1109
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,040
before it goes all vessel of the atoms.

1110
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,920
I can't. Those aren't my given orders.

1111
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,860
Man, you are uptight.

1112
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,060
I miss your original version.

1113
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,620
She was a whole lot friendlier.

1114
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:05,780
Original?

1115
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,060
A different me?

1116
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,600
Kauru!

1117
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,020
What's wrong with you?

1118
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:28,340
No!

1119
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:28,640
No!

1120
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:30,360
No!

1121
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:36,980
Asuka!

1122
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:38,960
I'm begging you!

1123
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,840
Please let me do this!

1124
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,720
Just lie down and take your punishment!

1125
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,120
Quit fighting!

1126
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,240
Are you serious?

1127
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,420
Moron Crony, the spear!

1128
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,300
Now's our chance to grab them!

1129
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,360
You hit a woman when she's not looking, you bastard.

1130
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,640
Here's your spear, Highness.

1131
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,900
We should turn around, Shinji.

1132
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,660
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1133
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,260
You can't be serious, Kaworu!

1134
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,120
After everything we've gone through to get them?

1135
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,080
You don't get

1136
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,280
it.

1137
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,340
Those aren't the spears we need.

1138
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,740
They're not!

1139
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,100
But how?

1140
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:41,580
You're the one who said we needed these spears!

1141
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,760
That's the only reason that I'm even in this damn Ava!

1142
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,620
The control system!

1143
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm doing this for you, Kaoru.

1144
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,420
For you and everyone else I know.

1145
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,680
I have to make everything right again.

1146
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,040
If I can restore the world, then even Misato will...

1147
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:07,760
Oh, no.

1148
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,360
Four-eyed crony, I've cleared all the obstacles.

1149
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,320
Permission to use AA ammo.

1150
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,000
I was hoping you'd say that.

1151
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,920
Here's my ace in the hole.

1152
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:23,240
There's no AT field.

1153
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:24,880
Their unit.

1154
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,460
It can be.

1155
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,420
Don't do it, Shinji.

1156
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,180
Stop it, you crap!

1157
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,520
Ahhhh!

1158
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:07,520
Fieldski, let's begin.

1159
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,880
Ava Mark 6?

1160
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,960
Hold on, pattern blue?

1161
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:19,780
What the hell is going on?

1162
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,620
Oh no!

1163
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,920
The 12th Angel is showing signs of life!

1164
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,240
Corrid, Colonel!

1165
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,400
Container 3!

1166
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,420
On the way!

1167
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,660
I'm not letting the third impact start back up!

1168
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:35,260
This

1169
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,540
thing is dead!

1170
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,340
This was my order.

1171
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:52,640
An angel!

1172
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,620
Hey, highness.

1173
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,320
You're wasting ammo blasting away like that.

1174
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,960
That thing is all core.

1175
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,540
It's pointless. We can't even make a dent in it.

1176
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,900
Besides, even if we defeat the final angel, who knows what'll pop out next?

1177
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,200
That'd be a real sight.

1178
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,040
Is that...

1179
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:29,960
It is.

1180
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,200
It's me.

1181
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,420
What am I?

1182
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,160
I can't...

1183
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,360
It's not responding!

1184
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,580
What's wrong with it?

1185
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:41,080
Kaoru!

1186
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,780
Are you okay?

1187
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,500
To think that I could have been so easily ensnared.

1188
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,740
Me, the first angel, utterly defeated by the 13th.

1189
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,700
What are you talking about?

1190
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,660
What do you mean?

1191
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,460
It means that the end and the beginning are one and the same.

1192
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,000
All devised by the king of the Lilin.

1193
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,300
All devised by your father.

1194
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,260
The

1195
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,420
DSS choker's detecting a pattern blue?

1196
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,660
But the 13th isn't supposed to exist.

1197
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,880
So this is what Gendo was after all this time.

1198
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,920
The time has come to revise the covenant of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1199
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,620
Now we say farewell.

1200
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,320
Though you may have transformed the shapes of your souls,

1201
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:31,280
you are still life forms gifted with the fruit of knowledge.

1202
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:40,500
You might be capable of living for eternity, but just like the rest of us, you cannot evade death when it comes for you.

1203
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:49,380
You assisted the evolution of those burdened with mortality by granting us the sophistication of civilization.

1204
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,760
On behalf of all mankind, I'm deeply grateful.

1205
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:01,280
In granting your demise, we honor your souls by returning them to their rightful place.

1206
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,280
Be assured your human instrumentality project

1207
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,000
And the deicide you've long sought

1208
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,820
Will be carried out for you

1209
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,100
Please rest peacefully

1210
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,760
Our wish for mankind has already come to pass

1211
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,580
And behold, it is good

1212
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,640
All is very good

1213
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,660
May the instrumentality of humanity come about

1214
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,939
As well as the peaceful purification of souls

1215
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,860
*Gunshot*

1216
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,240
We're too late. It's going beyond

1217
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,500
the pseudo-DNS phase.

1218
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,560
That thing's awakened already. Must be a straggler, Adam.

1219
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,040
*Mario screams*

1220
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,000
What's happening?

1221
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,880
What the hell is this?

1222
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,820
Is this my fault?

1223
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,420
because I pulled out the spears?

1224
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,240
This can't be.

1225
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,220
It's the fourth impact.

1226
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,160
You're witnessing the opening rites.

1227
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:37,920
Kado!

1228
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:39,620
The collar!

1229
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,440
Misato!

1230
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,640
18 field at maximum!

1231
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,240
Distill the EVA inside!

1232
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,580
All main guns ready Solveld!

1233
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,800
Load high angle rounds!

1234
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:00,340
We're preventing the fourth impact at all costs!

1235
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,020
Fire!

1236
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,080
We've been hit!

1237
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,600
Main gun down!

1238
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,920
The vessel of the atoms!

1239
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:19,280
Citral block hit!

1240
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:19,920
Damage unknown!

1241
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,060
New

1242
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,600
model A-bet is breaking free!

1243
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,460
We're not responding.

1244
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:24,800
We're going down.

1245
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,300
*Emergency crash

1246
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:49,220
*

1247
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:56,880
Oh, man!

1248
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,360
Holy crap.

1249
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:00,940
This situation is

1250
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,060
right

1251
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,260
on the verge of Boobar.

1252
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,960
You cover the brats, Ava.

1253
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,980
I'll do what I can to help Wunder.

1254
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,420
Roger, we can't shake the vessel of the atoms!

1255
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,860
An identified data

1256
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,380
infiltrating the main control system.

1257
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,740
It's taking over control of the entire ship!

1258
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,640
You have to stop today!

1259
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:38,520
No fair! Of course, Zaley's playing dirty!

1260
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,580
After mode!

1261
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,700
Come triple seven!

1262
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,220
Who the hell are you?

1263
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:19,540
Report from observation deck. It's Unit 2. She's engaging the vessel.

1264
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,140
I'm counting on you, Asuka.

1265
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,140
*Squeaking

1266
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:51,780
We're gonna go!

1267
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,120
This bastard's whole body is the car!

1268
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:04,820
We're out of time!

1269
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,800
Unitube, please! Forgive me!

1270
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,280
The control system's back on, Marek!

1271
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,780
I can't! Emergency takeoff!

1272
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,660
Immediately pursue the target, Eva!

1273
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,900
Captain, we can't do

1274
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,200
that while the main engine is down.

1275
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:32,760
Shinji!

1276
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,960
Is this really my fault?

1277
01:23:59,520 --> 01:23:59,960
Because

1278
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:00,660
I...

1279
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,740
Because I...

1280
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,460
It's not your fault, Shinji.

1281
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:10,420
This is happening because I've become the 13th angel.

1282
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,680
I'm the trigger, not you.

1283
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,820
What do I do?

1284
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:18,900
What do I do?

1285
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:24,760
Kaoru.

1286
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,280
What should...

1287
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:28,760
What should I do?

1288
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,440
Even after a soul is gone,

1289
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,780
Its wishes and curses still cling to this world.

1290
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,920
Its will will hew to the world's information

1291
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,320
and transform it.

1292
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,640
In time, we rewrite the very nature of who we are.

1293
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:46,700
I'm sorry.

1294
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,000
This is not the happiness you wanted and deserved.

1295
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,780
I'll close the gates of Goth.

1296
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,640
I don't want you to worry anymore, Shinji.

1297
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,560
Kaoru.

1298
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,260
I don't understand what you're telling me!

1299
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:03,620
I don't understand!

1300
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,320
Keep looking, Shinji. I know you'll find peace in a place where you belong.

1301
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,940
Let the ties that bind be your guide.

1302
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,780
Hey, try not to look so sad.

1303
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:35,040
We'll meet again, Shinji.

1304
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,600
Kauru!

1305
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,880
The gates of Goff still aren't closing.

1306
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,100
Puppy

1307
01:25:59,100 --> 01:25:59,620
boy must be

1308
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,540
Sele's insurance!

1309
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:18,700
Everything is wrapped up here!

1310
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,300
Snap out of it! Pod together!

1311
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,500
Stop being a baby!

1312
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:25,360
You can at least save the princess!

1313
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:26,960
Get up, King!

1314
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,040
Hear me? And while you're at it, quit being so

1315
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:31,620
damn naive!

1316
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,820
What a horrific mess.

1317
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,040
Almost precisely following Sele's designs.

1318
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:31,420
Not true.

1319
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,920
We did eliminate Sele's child,

1320
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:37,260
and we successfully led Unit 13 to its awakening.

1321
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,360
Even Colonel Katsaragi acted as expected.

1322
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,260
This will do fine for now.

1323
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,100
All hands, maintain alert status condition two.

1324
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,800
No pattern blue readings detected.

1325
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,840
Monitored airspace remains clear.

1326
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:53,380
Emergency repairs to midship area complete.

1327
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,940
We've managed to avert a fourth impact.

1328
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,820
No idea why.

1329
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:02,240
Misato, let's just call this a win for now.

1330
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:03,980
*BOOM

1331
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:03,980
*

1332
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:02,220
*Sigh*

1333
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,340
All you do is think about yourself.

1334
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:06,620
You think shutting up is the answer.

1335
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,640
Still acting like a baby

1336
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:41,980
Even after all these years you're the same old annoying brat come on put this on I

1337
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:46,200
Swear can't you even stand up on your own damn feet?

1338
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:55,660
You're that pilot right from the first batch of Iyanami types

1339
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,060
The L containment field density is too strong for them to rescue us here.

1340
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,500
We've got to move somewhere the Lilin can get close to.

1341
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:15,720
Come on!

1342
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:50,700
The flower that was just opened

1343
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:55,400
The flower that was just shining

1344
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:01,040
This year is too early

1345
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:04,860
In the end

1346
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,920
In the end

1347
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,620
You are the one who

1348
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,480
I am the following steps

1349
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:36,740
Everybody might be alive

1350
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,580
In the end

1351
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:45,680
No one can't wait

1352
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,580
I can't believe it

1353
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,080
I can't wait

1354
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,720
I can't wait

1355
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:09,340
I can't wait

1356
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:20,960
I'm sorry.

1357
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,640
I love you.

1358
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,700
teaches him what it means to hope.

1359
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,780
The instrumentality project is finally set in motion.

1360
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,960
Phile makes a bid for one last showdown

1361
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,100
to prevent the final impact.

1362
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,320
The Wunder cleaves to the skies.

1363
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,860
Ava unit eight plus two tears across

1364
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,480
the red wasteland of the earth.

1365
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,460
Next time, Sheen Evangelion, theatrical edition.

1366
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,700
And as always, we'll keep the fan service

1367
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,020
coming to the very end.
