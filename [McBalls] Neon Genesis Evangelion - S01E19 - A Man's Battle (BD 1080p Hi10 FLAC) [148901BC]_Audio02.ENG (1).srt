1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Speaker 1: I just saw you just look at

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,980
Speaker 1: The world's

4
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,260
*Ejects*

5
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,540
Speaker 2: It's not working! Unit 1's interlock circuit has been cut off!

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,960
Speaker 3: What about the eject signal?

7
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,760
Speaker 2: All codes are being blocked from inside the plug!

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
Speaker 2: It's not being accepted!

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,220
Speaker 3: Look! Shinji, if we hadn't taken over, you would have been killed!

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,140
Speaker 2: That's not the

11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,580
Speaker 4: point.

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,160
Speaker 3: Maybe, but it's the truth!

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,940
Speaker 4: Stop pushing me, dammit! Don't push me anymore!

14
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 4: Unit 1 has 185 seconds of power left.

15
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,640
Speaker 4: That's enough to destroy at least half of headquarters!

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,200
Speaker 5: He'll do it too, the way he is right now.

17
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,180
Speaker 2: Shinji, will you listen to us?

18
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,760
Speaker 2: If the commander hadn't made the decision to engage the dummy plug,

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
Speaker 2: everyone here could have been killed!

20
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:07,820
Speaker 2: I said

21
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,440
Speaker 4: that's beside the point, damn you!

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,720
Speaker 4: My father tried to kill Toji, and he did it using my hands!

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,320
Speaker 4: That bastard!

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,620
Father! I know you're there!

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,760
Say something! Answer me!

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,160
Speaker 5: Increase the entry plug's LCL pressure to its maximum level.

27
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,320
Speaker 6: What?

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,860
Speaker 5: I have no time to waste on a petulant child.

29
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,040
Speaker 4: I've still got a

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,060
Speaker 7: direct control circuit!

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,100
Damn it. Damn you.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,440
Speaker 2: How

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,880
Speaker 8: are you?

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,980
Speaker 8: I'm not hurt enough to stop doing my job.

35
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,140
Speaker 8: I couldn't lie in bed during an emergency like this.

36
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,580
Speaker 8: So what did they end up doing with Shinji?

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,760
Speaker 8: It's my understanding that they had to

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,060
Speaker 6: cut the

39
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 8: escape hatch open

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,120
Speaker 9: with a laser cutter and remove him forcibly.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,060
Speaker 10: This sucks. I'm afraid that this time...

42
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,780
Speaker 10: He's really finished. He can't talk his way out of this. Idiot.

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,160
Speaker 10: Is he alright?

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,940
Speaker 10: He wasn't injured, if that's what you mean.

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,840
Speaker 10: He's probably imagining that it was all a dream.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,500
Speaker 10: A dream?

47
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,320
Speaker 10: Yeah. Don't tell me you don't dream either.

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,340
Speaker 4: Shinji, why is he in the hospital there next to me?

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,020
Speaker 4: Is this the same hospital where my sister is?

50
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,580
Speaker 4: Shhh.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,860
Speaker 4: Shhh.

52
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,120
Speaker 4: Shinji and Ayanami?

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,180
Speaker 9: Ikari, why did you do that?

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,160
Speaker 4: Because I couldn't trust him.

55
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,420
Speaker 4: My father betrayed me, Rei.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,459
Speaker 4: Even though I was finally able to talk to him, he still doesn't understand me... at all.

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,840
Speaker 9: Did you try to understand him? His feelings?

58
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,420
Speaker 4: I used to try.

59
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Speaker 9: Why don't you try to understand him?

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,780
Speaker 4: I SAID I DID!

61
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,880
Speaker 9: You're running away from the truth because it's ugly?

62
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,440
Speaker 7: Why not?! What's wrong with running away from reality if it sucks?!

63
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,020
Speaker 4: This

64
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,940
Speaker 1: is weird.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,260
Speaker 1: What are those two arguing about?

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Speaker 8: This is by special permission. You've got exactly five minutes.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:46,900
Speaker 8: Thank you.

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,060
Speaker 6: Hey,

69
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,520
Speaker 11: it's the class rep.

70
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,900
Speaker 9: Tizuhara, how are you feeling?

71
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,900
Speaker 11: Lousy, but at least I'm

72
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 3: still alive.

73
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,220
Speaker 3: That's strange. I thought Shinji was here. Was that just a dream?

74
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,380
Speaker 9: They took him out of here yesterday.

75
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,960
Speaker 9: You slept for three days, Toji.

76
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
Speaker 1: I did? Three days?

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,040
Speaker 1: Did you?

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,060
Speaker 1: No,

79
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,460
Speaker 9: I've only been here a little while.

80
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,420
Speaker 9: They wouldn't let me.

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
Speaker 9: I mean, I came as the class representative, you know.

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,720
Speaker 3: Of course, I know that.

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,400
Speaker 9: Do you really?

84
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,060
Speaker 4: I'm sorry.

85
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,760
Speaker 4: I didn't get to eat the lunch you made.

86
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,560
Speaker 9: Don't worry about it.

87
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,160
Speaker 9: It's alright. Just wish I could bring you a lunch here, but it's not allowed.

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,540
Speaker 4: Uh, Srep, would you do me a favor?

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,260
Speaker 4: Uh-huh.

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,660
Speaker 4: Would you tell my sister that there's nothing wrong with me?

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,900
Speaker 4: Shinji Akari, Commander wants to see you.

92
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,800
Speaker 5: Disobeying orders. Using an Eva for personal vendettas.

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,740
Speaker 5: Childish intimidation.

94
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,900
Speaker 5: These are all criminal offenses.

95
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,180
Speaker 5: Do you have anything to say?

96
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,380
Speaker 4: Yes.

97
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,620
Speaker 4: I don't want to pilot an Ava anymore.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,040
Speaker 4: And I don't want to stay here either.

99
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,380
Speaker 5: Well then, you may leave.

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,260
Speaker 4: Yes.

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,260
Speaker 4: I'll go back to my old teacher.

102
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,540
Speaker 5: So, you're running away again?

103
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,600
Speaker 5: You disappoint me.

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,860
Speaker 5: I assume that we will never meet again.

105
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Speaker 4: Yes.

106
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,860
Speaker 4: That's my intent.

107
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:54,080
Speaker 5: This is me. Erase the third child's ren. Ray will become Unit 1's designated pilot, with the dummy plug as backup.

108
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:20,840
*phone rings*

109
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,840
*phone rings*

110
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:24,680
*phone rings*

111
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
*phone rings*

112
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,760
Speaker 4: Hey! Shinji!

113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,020
Speaker 4: Can you hear me?

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,860
Speaker 4: Is it true that you're leaving?

115
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,240
Speaker 4: It is true, isn't it?

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,720
Speaker 4: But why?

117
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
Speaker 4: Why are you running away again?

118
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,960
Speaker 4: I admired you!

119
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,740
Speaker 4: I envied you!

120
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,260
Speaker 4: You're different from us!

121
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,500
Speaker 4: Damn!

122
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,880
Speaker 4: Even Toji became a pilot!

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Speaker 4: - I don't think Asuka will be coming.

124
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,680
Speaker 4: She must be pretty disgusted with me.

125
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,220
Speaker 8: - Yes, she didn't even ask me to say goodbye to you.

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,100
Speaker 4: - That sounds like her.

127
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,280
Speaker 4: That's good.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,300
Speaker 8: - It's going to be hard if you keep hiding your anger like that.

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,660
Speaker 4: - That's your philosophy, Misato.

130
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,400
Speaker 4: I can't live the way you do.

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Speaker 8: - As I'm sure you may.

132
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:19,860
Speaker 8: - I'm sure you may.

133
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,440
Speaker 8: You know there will be a lot of restrictions

134
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,580
Speaker 8: placed upon your activities from now on.

135
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,640
Speaker 4: Yes, I know that, but--

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,260
Speaker 8: Yes?

137
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,720
Speaker 6: Let

138
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,020
Speaker 8: me ask

139
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,640
Speaker 4: you one thing.

140
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,219
Speaker 4: Why was Toji chosen to be the fourth child?

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,840
Speaker 8: It would seem that all of the students that are in your class

142
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,700
Speaker 8: are fourth-level candidates, Shinji.

143
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,200
Speaker 8: I just found out myself that it was yet

144
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,440
Speaker 8: another elaborate fabrication.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,460
Speaker 4: All of them?

146
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,340
Speaker 8: All of my classmates?

147
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,760
Speaker 8: Shinji, about Suzuhara.

148
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,040
Speaker 8: That was a mistake that can't be mended with words alone.

149
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,180
Speaker 8: But I have to be honest with you.

150
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,080
Speaker 8: I was projecting all of my dreams, hopes, and purpose

151
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,700
Speaker 8: onto you.

152
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,220
Speaker 8: I know that it's been a huge burden for you,

153
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,720
Speaker 8: but we-- and by that, I mean everyone at Nerve--

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,780
Speaker 8: have had no choice except to place our future in your hands.

155
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,580
Speaker 8: I want you to remember that.

156
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,340
Speaker 4: The end justifies the means?

157
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,940
Speaker 8: Yes, that's how it is.

158
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,580
Speaker 8: And another thing--

159
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,380
Speaker 8: I'll be leaving your passcode to headquarters

160
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,720
Speaker 8: and your room as they are.

161
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,660
Speaker 4: What's the point?

162
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,860
Speaker 4: Get rid of them.

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Speaker 4: It's over now. I won't pilot that thing.

164
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,940
Speaker 8: This is the real Shinji talking.

165
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,780
Speaker 8: I've never heard him sound so certain about anything before.

166
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,500
Speaker 12: A special state of emergency has been declared for the Tokai region.

167
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,220
Speaker 12: All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately.

168
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,540
Speaker 12: A special state of emergency has been declared for the Tokai region.

169
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,960
Speaker 12: An angel?

170
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,200
Speaker 13: All personnel, go to first stage battle stations. Prepare for ground-to-air intercept.

171
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,120
Speaker 6: Target status!

172
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,080
Speaker 9: It's broken through

173
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,660
Speaker 6: our perimeter!

174
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,120
Speaker 6: The Kamagataki defense line has been shattered!

175
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,900
Speaker 8: The first 18 layers of armor have been breached!

176
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,860
Speaker 8: I don't believe it. 18 layers destroyed in one shot.

177
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,140
Speaker 8: The AVAs can't deploy fast enough to intercept up top.

178
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,240
Speaker 8: Position Unit 2 for combat inside the geo-front, directly in front of headquarters.

179
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,140
Speaker 8: ASCA will snipe the target as soon as it breaks into the geo-front.

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,620
Speaker 2: Zero status?

181
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,500
Speaker 2: Unit 0 is in the AT Field Neutralization Zone, Major.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,040
Speaker 2: But the left arm still hasn't been regenerated.

183
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,900
Speaker 2: Then it's not ready for

184
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,420
Speaker 5: combat yet.

185
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,920
Speaker 5: Send Ray out in Unit 1.

186
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,880
Speaker 5: Prepare a dummy plug as the backup system.

187
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:42,960
Speaker 8: Right.

188
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,020
Speaker 8: Initiating entry. Charging LCL. Commencing A10 nerve connection.

189
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,260
Speaker 8: The pulse

190
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,620
Speaker 2: flow is reversing!

191
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,400
Speaker 2: Unit 1's refusing the neural connection!

192
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 6: Is that possible?

193
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,000
Speaker 5: Ikari? Yes. Is it refusing me?

194
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,280
Speaker 5: Abort the activation. Send Ray out an AVA Unit 0. Reactivate Unit 1 with the dummy plug.

195
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,820
Speaker 8: But Unit Zero isn't ready!

196
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,680
Speaker 8: It's not a problem. I can go.

197
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,300
Speaker 8: Rey?

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,720
Speaker 8: If I die, I can be

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,200
Speaker 4: replaced.

200
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,220
Speaker 4: I made up my mind. I swore I'd never pilot that thing.

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,140
Speaker 1: Hey, you there! What are you doing? Get in the shelter, quickly!

202
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,480
Speaker 3: It's no use! One more hand in the armor will be completely destroyed!

203
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,780
Speaker 8: I'm counting on you, Asuka.

204
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,320
Speaker 10: Here it comes. I can beat this angel even without Shinji the hero here to help out.

205
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,960
Speaker 9: Damn you!

206
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 6: Shite!

207
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,940
Speaker 13: Next!

208
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,080
Speaker 6: I'm

209
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 13: neutralized against AT Field, aren't I?

210
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,680
Speaker 13: Why won't you collapse, damn you!

211
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,880
Speaker 13: This can't be happening, I can't lose again, not again!

212
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,520
Speaker 6: My god!

213
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,880
Speaker 11: - Adopt a train hunt!

214
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,940
Speaker 11: - Alaska, no!

215
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,840
Speaker 11: Disengage your nerve connections now!

216
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,260
Speaker 10: - Evacuation training?

217
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,560
Speaker 10: What are you, stupid?

218
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,920
Speaker 10: That stuff's not for pilots like us.

219
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,260
Speaker 11: - Direct hit on the eighth block.

220
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,040
Speaker 11: Abandon the sixth shelter.

221
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,420
Speaker 11: All

222
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:05,960
Speaker 6: survivors

223
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,360
Speaker 11: go to the third shelter.

224
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,380
Speaker 3: - Unit two is severely damaged.

225
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,560
Speaker 3: It can't continue combat.

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,620
Speaker 3: How's Asuka?

227
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,600
She's alive!

228
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,940
Speaker 8: Verdumpt!

229
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,740
Speaker 3: The Angel has started moving again!

230
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
Speaker 8: What's Unit 1's status?

231
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,180
Speaker 8: Dummy plug

232
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,240
Speaker 2: upload completed.

233
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,960
Speaker 2: Call insertion completed.

234
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,520
Speaker 8: Initiate contact.

235
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,420
Speaker 8: Roger!

236
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,060
Speaker 8: What?!

237
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,940
Speaker 8: The pulse has vanished!

238
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,820
Speaker 8: It's refusing the

239
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,300
Speaker 2: dummy plug!

240
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,800
Speaker 2: Unit 1 won't activate!

241
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,420
Speaker 2: The dummy and

242
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:36,860
Speaker 5: Ray...

243
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,620
Speaker 5: Were both refused.

244
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,800
Speaker 5: Fyutsuki, take the con.

245
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,340
Speaker 4: Evacuate the casualties to the 6th block!

246
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,140
Speaker 4: Uninjured! Go to the 3rd shelter!

247
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,140
Speaker 1: Hey!

248
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:48,980
Speaker 1: This way!

249
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,980
Speaker 1: Hey, what are you doing? Do you wanna die?

250
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,140
Speaker 3: Asuka...

251
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,000
Speaker 3: Hey, Shinji!

252
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,240
Speaker 4: Kaji? What are you doing here?

253
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,380
Speaker 3: That's my line. What are you doing here, Shinji?

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,280
Speaker 3: I...

255
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,460
Speaker 4: I decided that I'd never pilot an Ava again.

256
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,660
Speaker 4: And since I decided that...

257
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,700
Speaker 3: Oh, really?

258
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,060
Speaker 3: Well, to answer your question, since my other job became public knowledge,

259
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,700
Speaker 3: I'm off the combat roster.

260
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,880
Speaker 3: So, here I am, sprinkling.

261
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,740
Speaker 3: At

262
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,580
Speaker 4: a time like this?

263
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,060
Speaker 3: What better time?

264
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,180
Speaker 3: Although I'd rather be between Misato's melons,

265
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,660
Speaker 3: this is a place I'd like to be when I die.

266
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,280
Speaker 4: Die?

267
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:46,560
Speaker 3: That's right. It is said that if an angel comes into contact with Adam, who lies sleeping beneath this very ground, humanity will be eradicated in the third impact.

268
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,760
Speaker 3: The only thing that can stop this is the one thing that has power equal to an angel's. Evangelion.

269
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,620
Speaker 4: Ayanami, with no rifle!

270
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,680
Speaker 4: It's an N2

271
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,100
Speaker 8: mine!

272
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,520
Speaker 8: Ray!

273
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,120
Speaker 8: AT Field, full power.

274
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,820
Speaker 6: Unit zero.

275
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,340
Speaker 6: Rei!

276
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,700
Speaker 6: Oh dear god.

277
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,360
Speaker 3: Shinji, the only thing I can do is stand here in water.

278
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,620
Speaker 3: But you, you have something that you can do.

279
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,280
Speaker 3: That only you can do.

280
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Speaker 3: Nobody is forcing you.

281
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,340
Speaker 3: Think for yourself and make that decision by yourself.

282
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,240
Speaker 3: Think about what you have to do now.

283
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,220
Speaker 3: Think about no longer having any regrets.

284
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,840
Speaker 3: *Sounds

285
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,000
of

286
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,300
Speaker 5: process from step 108.

287
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,840
Speaker 7: Let me pilot it!

288
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,740
Speaker 7: Please, let me pilot Unit 1!

289
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,780
Speaker 5: Father…

290
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,800
Speaker 5: Why are you here?

291
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,400
Speaker 4: I'm here because I'm the pilot of Evangelion Unit 1,

292
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,700
Speaker 7: Shinji Ikari!

293
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,700
Speaker 7: We've been breached! Target is inside the main shaft! It's advancing!

294
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,740
Speaker 7: Where is it heading?

295
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,320
Speaker 7: It's advancing directly towards Central Dogma!

296
00:16:59,580 --> 00:16:59,820
Speaker 7: It's

297
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,000
Speaker 8: coming

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,320
Speaker 6: here!

299
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,760
Speaker 8: All personnel evacuate!

300
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,339
All personnel evacuate! Repeat, all personnel evacuate!

301
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,400
Speaker 6: Wait!

302
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,319
Speaker 8: Ava Unit 1?

303
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,980
Speaker 8: Shinji!

304
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,900
*Screams*

305
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,140
No!

306
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,980
Speaker 1: - Please, I know! - Launch the fifth catapult!

307
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,300
Speaker 1: Check!

308
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
Speaker 1: *Mario screams*

309
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,880
Speaker 1: *Mario screams*

310
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,540
Speaker 6: *Mario

311
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:03,540
screams*

312
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,460
*Mario screams*

313
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,600
Speaker 2: Huh?

314
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,220
Speaker 2: Energy reserve depleted!

315
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,400
Speaker 2: One is completely drained its reserves!

316
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,220
Speaker 2: The backup power supply isn't working!

317
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,720
Speaker 2: Shinji!

318
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,580
Speaker 2: Shinji!

319
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:30,900
Speaker 7: Shinji!

320
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
Speaker 7: Dammit, move! Move! Move!

321
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,160
Speaker 7: Come on, move, you goddamn piece of junk!

322
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,540
Speaker 7: Move now or there's no point to any of this, dammit!

323
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,420
Speaker 11: Huh?

324
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,360
Speaker 11: What's that?

325
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,440
Speaker 7: Move! Move! Move!

326
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,740
Speaker 7: Move! Come on! Move!

327
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,740
Speaker 7: Oh, God! You've got to move now!

328
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,180
Speaker 7: Everyone will be killed!

329
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
Speaker 7: God, I'm sick of it already!

330
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,500
Speaker 7: Come on move! God damn you, you filthy stinky buster!

331
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,060
Speaker 2: It's... it's reactivated.

332
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,940
Speaker 8: Oh my god!

333
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,400
Speaker 2: This is impossible.

334
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,400
Speaker 2: It must be wrong. How can Shinji's sync ratio with Unit 1 be over 400%?!

335
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,360
Speaker 2: It's finally happened.

336
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,780
Speaker 9: It's aware.

337
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,560
Speaker 9: Oh!

338
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,800
*Sigh*

339
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,080
Speaker 6: It's breaking

340
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,460
Speaker 13: free!

341
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,720
Speaker 13: Free of what?

342
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,620
Speaker 13: Those plates weren't just armor.

343
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,140
Speaker 13: They were also restraints.

344
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,680
Speaker 7: Those bindings allowed us to control it.

345
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,100
Speaker 7: But now the Ava is removing the web that binds it to our will.

346
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,900
Speaker 7: The beast inside the Ava is free at last!

347
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,180
Speaker 3: Unit 1's awakened and been set free.

348
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,640
Speaker 3: Zele sure won't stay quiet for this.

349
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Speaker 3: Was this part of your scenario, Commander Ikari?

350
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,340
Speaker 3: It's begun at last.

351
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,980
Speaker 3: Indeed.

352
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,860
Speaker 3: This is the beginning.

353
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,900
Speaker 3: Oh!

354
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,640
Speaker 11: In other words, the rain is big

355
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 11: Fill my home with song and let me sing forevermore

356
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,060
For all our love, for all our love

357
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,920
Speaker 11: In other worlds, please be true.

358
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,240
Speaker 11: In other worlds, I

359
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,840
love you.

360
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,120
Speaker 8: Fused with another existence, what will Shinji see?

361
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,460
Speaker 8: Meanwhile, everyone who was left behind tries desperately to rescue him, but the attempt fails.

362
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,700
Speaker 8: It's the next episode. Form of the mind, form of the man.

363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:47,860
.
