The young man like a man like a man You are a young man, you are a fairy tale If the wind is now on the door, I can only see myself, You are smiling You are so happy You are so happy I don't know what you can do You are so happy But I will know that you will find the back of your back The future will be the way to the future The holy of the天使 of the day The window from the day to the day The hot-to-day light of the day The dream of the day to the day The sky will be the shining

Speaker 2
Ashton.

Speaker 3
The fact

Speaker 2
that the instrumentality project is behind schedule? The

Speaker 3
projects are all linked together. There are no problems.

Speaker 2
Including Rey? Well, I won't press you. So how will we deal with you-know-who? Let him do as he wishes. The same with the Marduk Institute. I agree. We can make use of him. For a while. What

Speaker 4
started here? Sixteen years ago.

Speaker 5
It's me.

Speaker 4
Ah, so it is. This

Speaker 5
is Shannon Bio Inc., a foreign chemical firm. It's been like this for nine years, nine years without a single change. So far, 106 corporations out of the 108 affiliated with the Marduk Institute have turned out to be dummy companies.

Speaker 4
And this one is the 107th.

Speaker 5
This is the company's registration record.

Speaker 4
And you want me to take a look at the board of directors, don't you?

Speaker 5
You already know about this? I

Speaker 4
know most of the names, yes. The Marduk Institute is supposed to be an advisory body established under the control of the Human Instrumentality Committee for the purpose of selecting EVA pilots. Something's not adding up right here.

Speaker 5
Your task is to investigate Nerve. Getting involved with the Marduk may be an ill-advised step.

Speaker 4
Well, I can't help it. My nose for trouble has a penchant for getting my eyes in the

Speaker 5
wrong places.

Speaker 4
Hi, this is Kaji. I'm out right now, but you can leave your name and a message at the beep.

Speaker 6
Help me, Kaji! Don't touch me, you pervert!

Speaker 7
That ought to do it. What's going

Speaker 1
on?

Speaker 7
I was just calling Kaji. I wanted him to take me out tomorrow. I've been calling him and calling him, but he's always out these days. He's always out doing something. You mean you'll be available tomorrow? Unfortunately, it seems so. Great! Then I've got a favor to ask you. Well, you see...

Speaker 8
What? A date? The guy's a friend of Kadama, my big sister, and he keeps asking and asking me to set you and him up.

Speaker 7
Pretty please?

Speaker 9
Huh? Get back to your work! Sorry.

Speaker 10
Why don't you get back to work, Toji?

Speaker 7
Microsis operation completed. Inversible

Speaker 10
graph measurement

Speaker 9
byline. So,

Speaker 11
which dress are you wearing? Oh, for the wedding tomorrow?

Speaker 6
Well, I

Speaker 8
wore the pink suit for Kiyomi's wedding, and I wore the dark blue dress for Kotoko's shower, and... There's that orange one. You haven't worn that one lately. The orange one? Well, there's a reason I haven't worn it. It's too tight. Thank you! Maybe I should just buy a new one. Man, all these stupid weddings are killing my bank account. Tell me about it. We've been to so many showers, I'm almost broke. Yeah, it's like everyone's in a rush to get married before they turn

Speaker 11
30. And you don't want to be the last one still single, do you?

Speaker 7
Excuse me? Okay, you

Speaker 11
guys can take off now.

Speaker 7
Good work. It's about time! These stupid experiments are really getting on my nerves! Speaking of

Speaker 11
which, Shinji seems more subdued than usual. Tomorrow's the day. Oh, yeah. Tomorrow.

Speaker 9
Tomorrow. I have to see my father tomorrow. What should I talk to him about, Rei? I don't understand. Why are you asking me? Because I've seen you talking with my father and actually enjoying it. Say, my father. What's he like?

Speaker 12
I don't know. Oh. Have you been watching me because you wanted to ask that question? Mm-hmm. Hey, when we were cleaning, that cloth,

Speaker 9
the way you ringed it, it reminded me of a mother when you squeezed it. A mother? Yeah. It just reminded me of a mom. I bet you'll make a great mother, Ray. I mean...

Speaker 1
You... Embarrass me.

Speaker 7
I'm home! What's

Speaker 12
happening?

Speaker 7
You better go to bed, Oscar. Don't you have a date tomorrow? With some med student. Oh, Misato! - Yo, can I use your lavender perfume? - Uh, no. - No, Nini. - That stuff's not for kids. Is Shinji in his room? - Yeah, ever since he got home. I don't think he wants to meet his father. If he hates him so much, why doesn't he just say? You Japanese are weird. - Well, he doesn't actually hate him. That's the

Speaker 8
problem.

Speaker 3
- Leave. Good work, Shinji.

Speaker 8
Shinji! I'm coming in, okay? You're worried about seeing your father tomorrow, right? You mustn't run away, Shinji. Nothing will ever change unless you have the courage to step forward. I know that, Misato. You're going to find out the truth. You've got to keep moving forward. After each step, you've got to keep taking another afterwards. Anyway, when you see him tomorrow, you've got to keep your chin held high, because you'll be seeing her too. Good night, Shinji.

Speaker 10
You bought a new dress, didn't you? Let me see. Oh, you want to see it, do you? It's an expensive one. Price doesn't

Speaker 7
always be pleasant. You're on. Tell me about it. Well, what do you think? Did you pick that one with Paji in mind? Grow up. Long time

Speaker 7
ago. Well, see ya. Later.

Speaker 8
You must keep three bags in your heart. And now, let us proceed to the reception.

Speaker 11
Little boy

Speaker 8
Blue is late. That over-sexed idiot's never been on time in his whole lazy life. For your dates, you mean? He gets to work early.

Speaker 4
Hello, girls. You're looking particularly lovely today. I had a little trouble getting out of work on time. I find

Speaker 8
that hard to believe since you don't do anything. You could at least

Speaker 4
have

Speaker 8
taken the time and trouble to shave that awful stubble. Your tie is crooked.

Speaker 4
Well, thank you. You act like you're married. You're very astute, Ritsipoo.

Speaker 8
Who'd marry

Speaker 6
this bum?

Speaker 3
It's been three years since we were last here.

Speaker 9
That's when I ran away. I haven't come back here since then. I just don't believe that my mom is really resting here. I don't even remember her face.

Speaker 3
Burying memories is man's way of surviving But there are some things a man should never forget Yui taught me that one irreplaceable thing, Shinji That is the reason I come here, to confirm that commitment

Speaker 9
You don't have a picture of her?

Speaker 3
No photographs Even this grave is an artifice Nothing remains

Speaker 9
That's like my teacher said You cast everything away

Speaker 3
Everything is kept in my heart I'm satisfied with that Our time is up. I'm leaving now.

Speaker 9
Father! I'm glad that we could talk together today.

Speaker 3
Indeed.

Speaker 7
- I'm not sure what

Speaker 9
you But I could have quit any time. So

Speaker 7
why didn't you? Huh?

Speaker 9
Nobody told me to stop, I guess. Oh, I should have known. Hey, you're back early. I thought you were going out to dinner, too.

Speaker 7
Oh, my date was even more boring than you. Saw Wiley was standing in line for the roller coaster, I took a train back here.

Speaker 9
That seems kind of cold.

Speaker 7
Oh, gosh, he's the only real man in my life. I know it's getting a little late, but I've

Speaker 8
got to go powder my nose.

Speaker 4
Making a quick exit? High heels. It's been a while since we went out together.

Speaker 11
She's drinking too much. She's losing her control.

Speaker 4
Sometimes you just have to drink to keep yourself under control. All of us do.

Speaker 11
Well, you did used to live with her, so I guess you'd know the truth.

Speaker 4
Well, that was a lifetime ago. She didn't even own a set of heels back then.

Speaker 11
That's not how we saw it back when we were in school.

Speaker 4
We were kids, Ritsu. That wasn't real. We were just children playing house. It was nice. But life's not that simple. Oh, I almost forgot.

Speaker 11
The cat dragged this in. Thank you, Kaji, for being

Speaker 4
honest. To the ladies, yes. Otherwise,

Speaker 11
eh... I doubt that. And Misato?

Speaker 4
I've lost that war before. Doom battles aren't my style.

Speaker 11
I think you still have a chance.

Speaker 4
Well, what about you?

Speaker 11
Oh, I don't like to talk about myself. There's nothing much to say.

Speaker 4
Why is she taking so long? How much makeup can she wear?

Speaker 11
Hmm.

Speaker 4
What

Speaker 11
were you doing in Kyoto?

Speaker 4
I wasn't in Kyoto.

Speaker 11
Don't try to fool me. You'll get your fingers burned if you get too involved in this. That's the advice of a friend.

Speaker 4
I'd rather be burned by the heat of my passion for you.

Speaker 8
Well, should I buy you some fireworks?

Speaker 4
Hello.

Speaker 8
Oh, you never change, do you?

Speaker 4
Of course I change. The act of living is an embracement of change.

Speaker 11
Homeostasis and transestasis. Homeo-what? One is a force to maintain the present status, and the other is a force for constant change. Anything that lives is composed of these two conflicting forces.

Speaker 4
Like men and women.

Speaker 11
I'll just be taking off now. I've got some work to do. Now?

Speaker 4
That's too bad. Mm-hmm. Have fun.

Speaker 8
But... - - Hey, Shinji, it's me. I'm gonna be out drinking with Kaji. Don't wait up for me, okay?

Speaker 9
- Right. Yeah, sure. - Misato? - Yeah, she'll be late, so don't wait up for her.

Speaker 7
- What? You mean she won't be back until tomorrow morning?

Speaker 9
- I doubt it. She's going out with Kaji. - Are you dense? That guarantees it.

Speaker 8
Drinking

Speaker 4
till you throw up. How old are you?

Speaker 8
Old enough to regret it.

Speaker 4
I'm old enough as well.

Speaker 8
You're damn right. I can't

Speaker 4
believe that you wear high heels these days. Time really does fly.

Speaker 8
You need to shave your sloppy face.

Speaker 6
Okay, let

Speaker 8
me walk. Thank you. Kaji, do you think I've changed?

Speaker 4
You're even prettier.

Speaker 8
Not what I mean. When I told you there was someone else, it wasn't true. But you knew that, didn't you?

Speaker 4
No.

Speaker 8
One morning, I just realized how much like my father you were. I panicked. I couldn't believe that I wanted a man just like my father. I was terrified, so I ran. I was so scared. I was afraid of becoming a woman, afraid of being with you, and thought I hated my father. But then I fell in love with a man who was just like my father. I thought joining Nerve would be a way to sever those ties. And then it turned out that my father was with Nerve. So I tried to bury all of my feelings by swearing to avenge myself against the angels.

Speaker 4
Choosing that path was your decision. You don't have to apologize to anyone.

Speaker 8
Don't bullshit me, Kaji. I just turned tail and ran. It was just an escape from the real world and my father. I'm no better than Shinji is. I'm a Kawagashi. Well, it's just like right now. I had to get up the nerve to get drunk enough to even tell

Speaker 12
you the truth.

Speaker 8
I'm a child. I have no right to be Shinji's

Speaker 12
guardian.

Speaker 8
Look at me, afraid to accept a helping hand up from a man except when I'm so falling down drunk that I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm a horrible woman and I'd use you, use

Speaker 6
you because I'm

Speaker 8
a coward. I'm pathetic.

Speaker 7
Hey, Shinji. You wanna kiss me? Huh?

Speaker 6
What?

Speaker 7
Kissing, you know. Have you ever done it? Uh-uh. So let's do it. But why? I've got nothing else to do. That's your reason?

Speaker 9
You're weird.

Speaker 7
Afraid to kiss a girl on the anniversary of your mom's death? Is she watching you from up in heaven? That's not

Speaker 9
it. Or

Speaker 7
are you scared? I'm not

Speaker 9
afraid!

Speaker 7
Pucker up! Right. Did you brush her teeth? Yeah. Then here I come. Stop breathing. It's tickling me.

Speaker 6
*Gasp*

Speaker 4
- Hang on, we're here. - Hey, Kaji.

Speaker 7
- What? Hey, hello, Kaji.

Speaker 4
- There, I'll be leaving now.

Speaker 7
- You can spend the night here.

Speaker 4
- I'd never live it down if I went to work like this.

Speaker 7
- Oh, you could do it. Hey, come on, Kaji, it'd...

Speaker 4
Later, Asuka.

Speaker 9
Lavender review.

Speaker 4
Take care of Misato, okay?

Speaker 9
Sure. Good night, Kaji.

Speaker 4
Yeah.

Speaker 9
What's wrong? You look upset.

Speaker 7
That's because you kissed me, you jerk!

Speaker 9
Let me call a roll. Ladies first. Ayanami? Rei Ayanami? Is she absent again?

Speaker 4
*Bell rings

Speaker 8
And the other would appear to be a spy for the Japanese government.

Speaker 4
Hm. So you knew.

Speaker 8
Don't underestimate nerve.

Speaker 4
Was this ordered by Ikari?

Speaker 8
No. My initiative. But if you stay with this other job, you'll die.

Speaker 4
Perhaps not. Commander Ikari is using me for his own ends. But I am sorry that I've kept this secret from you.

Speaker 8
I'll let it pass. Repayment for your help yesterday.

Speaker 4
I appreciate that. But you should know that the Commander and Ritsuko are hiding something from you too. And this is it!

Speaker 8
Oh my god. Is it an Eva? No, it can't be.

Speaker 4
Yes. The key to the second impact and everything that's happened since. The starting point of everything. This is Adam.

Speaker 8
Adam? But why is the first angel here? You're right, Kashi. I don't know, Nerv. I don't know NERV at all!

Speaker 12
Darling, kiss me Fill my heart with song And let me sing forevermore You are all I long For all I worship and I do In other words Please be true Before the world

Speaker 10
I love you After finally getting ahead of Asuka and the sync tests, Shinji is full of pride, but everything comes crashing down when he's swallowed by the Sea of Darak. As his Ava's energy supply runs out, fear and loneliness surround him, enveloping him in a new level of anguish and despair. His very survival is at stake in the next thrilling episode.
