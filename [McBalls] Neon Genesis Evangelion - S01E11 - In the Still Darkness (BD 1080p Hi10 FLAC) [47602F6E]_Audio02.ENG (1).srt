1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Speaker 2: I'm

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,540
Speaker 1: just looking at you and smiling.

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,000
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to touch the one I want.

5
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:44,740
Speaker 1: I'm still in awe of my dreams.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,280
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you'll notice that the back of my eyes.

7
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,960
Speaker 1: The future will be the way to the future

8
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,260
Speaker 1: The world is a terrible, the天使's the day

9
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,960
Speaker 1: The window from the end of the day

10
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,740
Speaker 1: The hot air is a hot air to the day

11
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,460
Speaker 1: The memories of the night

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
Speaker 1: The sky is shining

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,800
Speaker 3: Hey, cool! I just want a free ice cream bar!

14
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,040
Speaker 4: The cost of having my laundry done is killing me.

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Speaker 5: Yeah, I know. I just wish I had the spare time to do my laundry for myself.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,600
Speaker 6: Could

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,200
Speaker 7: be worse.

18
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,580
Speaker 6: At least we sleep at home.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,680
Speaker 4: Oh, Commander Friutski. Good morning, sir.

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,160
Speaker 4: Good morning, sir.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,540
Speaker 6: Good morning.

22
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,820
Speaker 4: Well, you're up early today, sir.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,900
Speaker 6: I've got to represent Commander Ikari uptown.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,960
Speaker 4: Ah, today's the city council meeting, isn't it?

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,920
Speaker 6: An exercise in ennui.

26
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,940
Speaker 6: Ikari always sticks me with the most boring and tedious assignments.

27
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,520
Speaker 6: I couldn't handle it without the Magi's help.

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,180
Speaker 4: Speaking of which, election day is coming up, isn't it?

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,300
Speaker 6: Yes, but the council really has no authority anyway.

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,980
Speaker 6: Actually, the Magi run just about everything.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,140
Speaker 5: Really? You mean the same three supercomputers we use?

32
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,500
Speaker 5: Yes.

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,060
Speaker 6: Our government is run by the majority decision of three different computers.

34
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,680
Speaker 6: I suppose it's a sort of a form of democracy.

35
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,320
Speaker 5: And the council members just go along with their decisions?

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:57,720
Speaker 5: Well,

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,000
Speaker 6: it's been an effective form of government thus far.

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,900
Speaker 5: This city really is built on science. We're so lucky to be living in such a wonderful

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,280
Speaker 4: time.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,020
Speaker 6: Eh, technophiles.

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,700
Speaker 6: You're running an experiment with Unit Zero this morning, aren't you?

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Speaker 4: Yes. We're going to be performing the second prolonged EVA activation test at 10.30.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,440
Speaker 6: Ah, I'll expect good news.

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,040
Speaker 4: Abort the test! Break the circuits!

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,720
Speaker 4: Cutting circuits.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,260
Speaker 3: Power supply

47
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,800
Speaker 8: restored.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,200
Speaker 4: It seems that one's the problem again.

49
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,760
Speaker 5: Yes. It looks like the conversion efficiency is 0.8% lower than our calculation.

50
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,000
Speaker 8: The conversion is barely within tolerance, though. What'll we do?

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,740
Speaker 8: Let's

52
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,720
Speaker 4: try it again using the same configuration, but lower the reciprocal conversion rate by 0.01.

53
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,260
Speaker 4: All right, let's start the experiment over again.

54
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,020
Speaker 7: Hey!

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Hold the elevator!

56
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,660
Speaker 9: Got it.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,140
Speaker 9: Man, it's been a while since I ran that hard.

58
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,720
Speaker 9: So, what's with the black expression, Sunshine?

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,320
Speaker 10: It's nausea from having to see you.

60
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,620
Speaker 10: Yes,

61
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,680
Speaker 4: hold one minute, please.

62
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,260
Speaker 11: What?

63
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,720
Speaker 11: Uh,

64
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,540
Speaker 12: well, Father, uh, well...

65
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,700
Speaker 11: What is it? Hurry up.

66
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:55,160
Speaker 12: I'm supposed to tell my parents that an interview for advanced vocational education is going to be held at school.

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,600
Speaker 11: I've delegated all of that to Katsuragi. Don't bother me with such nonsense

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Speaker 9: anymore.

69
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,680
Speaker 9: Don't forward any more of these calls to me.

70
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,400
Speaker 10: Huh?

71
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,800
Speaker 9: The power's out?

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,220
Speaker 10: No, it can't be. It's not possible.

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,960
Speaker 2: Something's wrong. An accident?

74
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,700
Speaker 9: Perhaps Dr. Akagi made a mistake, huh?

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
Speaker 5: The main power supply is shut down.

76
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,220
Speaker 5: Voltage level is zero.

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,820
Speaker 5: Uh, it's not our fault.

78
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,540
Speaker 9: Well, what do you think?

79
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,180
Speaker 5: The backup

80
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,780
Speaker 10: supply should switch back on any second now.

81
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,240
Speaker 6: No, sir. The backup circuits aren't working either.

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,580
Speaker 6: That can't be.

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,540
Speaker 6: Which circuits are still functioning?

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,820
Speaker 2: Only 1.2% of them!

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,820
Speaker 2: Only 9 circuits from number 2567!

86
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,420
Speaker 6: Connect all the remaining power circuits to maintain the Magi in Central Dogma.

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,940
Speaker 6: But that could interfere with our life support systems.

88
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,280
Speaker 6: Do it! We need the Magi!

89
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,740
Nozomu Takahashi wants to help you form a more cheerful government...

90
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,400
Speaker 6: Man, that Captain Katsuragi sure is lazy.

91
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,180
Speaker 9: I mean, can't she at least make the time to go and pick up her own laundry?

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,580
Speaker 9: Huh?

93
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,620
Speaker 3: Maybe Commander Akari was just really busy.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,760
Speaker 3: I don't think so. And it wasn't like he hung up.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,240
Speaker 3: It sounded more like the line had failed.

96
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,380
Speaker 3: Hey, are you a man or what? Why do you let each and every little incident get under your skin?

97
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,420
Speaker 3: What are you doing?

98
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,260
Speaker 3: Here, let me...

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,300
Speaker 3: Hmm? Huh? Huh? Huh?

100
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,000
Speaker 3: Stupid thing! It must be broken, damn it!

101
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,140
Speaker 3: One, two,

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:45,960
three!

103
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,760
Speaker 4: We'd better head for the command center.

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,120
Speaker 4: If the backup power hasn't kicked in yet...

105
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,300
Speaker 4: Then something's very wrong.

106
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,160
Speaker 9: What's the backup system?

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
Speaker 4: There are three backup circuits.

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
Speaker 10: It's impossible for all of these to fail at once.

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,320
Speaker 11: Then that means these circuit breakers didn't go on their own.

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,100
Speaker 11: Someone did this intentionally.

111
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,100
Speaker 6: Well, it would be a disaster if an Angel were to attack right now.

112
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,840
Speaker 8: Radar's detected an unidentified object.

113
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,180
Speaker 8: Projected landing point is in the form of atomic region.

114
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,060
Speaker 8: It must be Angel number eight.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,380
Speaker 8: Yeah, an Angel.

116
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,600
Speaker 8: What'll we do?

117
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,140
Speaker 8: I guess the standard procedure is to go full alert status.

118
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,480
Speaker 8: It looks like this one's heading straight for Tokyo 3 and Nerve.

119
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,540
Speaker 8: Looks like it.

120
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,100
Speaker 8: Well, there's nothing we can do.

121
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,940
Speaker 4: It's still advancing.

122
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,020
Speaker 8: Any word yet from Tokyo 3?

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,400
Speaker 8: They're

124
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,060
Speaker 4: still not responding to our transmissions.

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,420
Speaker 8: What in the hell are those Nerve guys doing?

126
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,960
Speaker 4: I never thought I'd actually have to use one of these escape tubes.

127
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,880
Speaker 4: I figured they were just holdovers that we held onto just for

128
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,700
Speaker 2: our peace of mind.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,700
Speaker 2: Well, being prepared is half the battle.

130
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,060
Speaker 3: This one doesn't work either.

131
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,880
Speaker 2: None of the facilities work.

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,840
Speaker 3: This is odd.

133
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,920
Speaker 3: Has something happened in the geo front?

134
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
Speaker 2: A natural assumption.

135
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,560
Speaker 3: Well, let's try to

136
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,620
Speaker 10: contact Nerve headquarters.

137
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,600
Speaker 10: The emergency phone isn't working either.

138
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,280
Speaker 11: There's no answer on line 77. None of them work.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,260
Speaker 10: No,

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,440
Speaker 2: it's disconnected.

141
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,140
Speaker 10: This one, too. The

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,060
Speaker 3: main and emergency cables are all down.

143
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,580
Speaker 13: So what now?

144
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,380
Speaker 3: Oh.

145
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,919
Speaker 12: What are you looking for?

146
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,020
Speaker 3: What do you think, Doomkopf? I'm looking for my emergency manual.

147
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,260
Speaker 3: We should go to NERF headquarters ourselves.

148
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,000
Speaker 3: That's right, but before that, we're going to have to decide which of us will be this group's leader.

149
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,520
Speaker 3: Naturally, I have the best qualifications.

150
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,080
Speaker 3: Any objections?

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,140
Speaker 3: Well, let's go.

152
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,020
Speaker 2: Nervous over this way.

153
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,280
Speaker 2: We can use the access port for Route 7.

154
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,020
Speaker 12: But the doors don't work.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,260
Speaker 12: Oh, we can open it manually.

156
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,560
Speaker 3: Well, there you go, Shinji.

157
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,420
Speaker 3: This is your department.

158
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,900
Speaker 3: You're the one who wants to be in charge,

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,660
Speaker 13: but whenever going gets tough,

160
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,300
Speaker 13: you always defer to me.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,580
Speaker 8: That damn council always defers to us when the going gets tough.

162
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,480
Speaker 8: Well, what did they say?

163
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,440
Speaker 8: Those Tokyo-2 buttheads, they're getting ready to flee, of course.

164
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,180
Speaker 5: The angel is still advancing.

165
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
Speaker 8: In any case, we've got to try and make contact with Nerve.

166
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,500
Speaker 8: But how are we going to do that?

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,920
Speaker 8: We fly there ourselves.

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,220
This is the 3rd District JAS-DF.

169
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
An unidentified object is moving toward this area.

170
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,540
Speaker 6: Oh boy, I gotta report this to headquarters, but how? Oh man!

171
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:02,860
Speaker 6: Hey,

172
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,400
Speaker 10: Booster Takahashi, he's the candidate who remains calm, even in situations like this.

173
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,240
Speaker 9: Ah, alright.

174
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,640
Speaker 10: I'm dying, it's too hot in here.

175
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,500
Speaker 9: The air conditioners are down too. If you're so hot, Katsuragi, why don't you take off your shirt?

176
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,640
Speaker 9: There's no reason for you to be shy, you know.

177
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Speaker 10: Don't even think about trying to take advantage of this situation.

178
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 9: Yeah, right.

179
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,120
Speaker 10: It's getting even warmer now that

180
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,540
Speaker 4: the air is getting stagnant.

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
Speaker 4: It's hard to believe that this base has the world's most advanced technology.

182
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
Speaker 4: Yeah, but look at the commanders.

183
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,860
Speaker 5: Even in this heat, they're both still cool and in command.

184
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,060
Speaker 6: It's hot.

185
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,280
Speaker 6: Yes.

186
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,240
Speaker 6: This geofront was designed to be a self-sufficient colony.

187
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,180
Speaker 6: It's supposed to be able to operate even when completely isolated from the outside.

188
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,920
Speaker 6: It's impossible for all the power sources to have broken down.

189
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,160
Speaker 4: Someone caused this?

190
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,800
Speaker 6: It would be a logical way to

191
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,580
Speaker 11: indirectly dissect this facility.

192
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:31,920
Speaker 11: You

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,000
Speaker 4: mean that they could figure out Nerve's layout by the restoration process?

194
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,320
Speaker 6: They are clever bastards.

195
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:37,820
Speaker 6: I

196
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,780
Speaker 4: could run a dummy program through the Magi.

197
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,900
Speaker 4: That would make it more difficult to get a complete grasp of our structure.

198
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,060
Speaker 6: Make it so.

199
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,860
Speaker 4: Yes, sir.

200
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Speaker 6: I can't believe that the first havoc wrecked upon our headquarters was caused by another member of our own species.

201
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,940
Speaker 11: Mankind's greatest enemy is man himself.

202
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,940
Speaker 13: This usually only takes two minutes. Are you sure this is the right way?

203
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,140
Speaker 13: Of course I'm

204
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,040
Speaker 3: sure. We'll be at the Geo Front any minute now.

205
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,540
Speaker 3: Uh, haven't I heard that four times already?

206
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,240
Speaker 3: Jeez, why do you have to nitpick everything? You're always so negative.

207
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,220
Speaker 3: Me? What?

208
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,460
Speaker 2: Silence, please.

209
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:12,620
Speaker 2: Oh,

210
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
Speaker 3: what now, Wonder Girl?

211
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,080
Speaker 2: Listen.

212
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,820
Speaker 2: Attention

213
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,400
all nerve personnel. There's an angel approaching.

214
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,980
Attention all nerve personnel.

215
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
Speaker 14: That's Yuga! Hey!

216
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,200
Speaker 14: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

217
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,140
Speaker 14: There's an angel approaching.

218
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,060
An angel is approaching.

219
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,240
Speaker 3: A new angel?

220
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,160
Speaker 2: We can't waste any more time. There's a shortcut.

221
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,680
Speaker 3: Hey, don't forget that I'm the leader here.

222
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,660
Speaker 3: So where is this shortcut?

223
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,620
Speaker 3: This way may be quick, but we

224
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,980
Speaker 13: look really stupid.

225
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,460
Speaker 13: Hey, just what are the angels?

226
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,400
Speaker 13: Why are you asking now?

227
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,440
Speaker 13: I don't know. It just doesn't make sense. Angels are messengers from God, right?

228
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,840
Speaker 13: Why are we fighting angels?

229
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,760
Speaker 13: What are you,

230
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,980
Speaker 3: stupid? They attacked us. When someone's attacking you, you can't just sit there and do nothing, right?

231
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,060
Speaker 3: Let's see. To the right.

232
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,200
Speaker 3: I think the correct path is to the left.

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,560
Speaker 3: Stop contradicting me!

234
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,560
Speaker 3: Shinji, what do you think?

235
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,040
Speaker 3: Uh, uh...

236
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,820
Speaker 3: I'm not certain.

237
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,460
Speaker 3: Look, I'm the leader, so you can both just shut up and follow me.

238
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,500
Speaker 12: We're going up again.

239
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,000
Speaker 12: I thought something was odd here.

240
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,280
Speaker 3: So why didn't you say something earlier?

241
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,180
Speaker 3: You're always nitpicking, huh?

242
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,180
Speaker 3: This has got to be the Geo Front this time.

243
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,740
Speaker 3: -

244
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,740
Speaker 7: -

245
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,240
-

246
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,740
Speaker 7: -

247
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,040
- -

248
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,680
-

249
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,140
-

250
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:56,780
Speaker 3: - Well,

251
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:57,540
Speaker 3: we'd

252
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,480
Speaker 3: better hurry. Now that I've visually

253
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,960
Speaker 3: confirmed

254
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,180
Speaker 6: the angel's presence...

255
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,400
- - - There's

256
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,480
Speaker 6: an

257
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,720
Speaker 6: angel

258
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,280
Speaker 6: approaching! We have to dispatch an Ava immediately!

259
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,460
Speaker 6: But how?

260
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,800
Speaker 11: Fyutski, take charge here.

261
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,260
Speaker 11: What?

262
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,500
Speaker 11: I'm going down to the cage to prepare the Evas for manual launch.

263
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,020
Speaker 11: Manually?

264
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,160
Speaker 11: Can that be done?

265
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,760
Speaker 11: We have a diesel generator for emergencies.

266
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,420
Speaker 11: Well, yes, but who is going to pilot them?

267
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,100
Speaker 3: This

268
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,460
way.

269
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,380
Speaker 3: You're Commander Ikari's favorite, aren't you?

270
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,720
Speaker 3: I guess that that means you get treated a little different, right?

271
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,820
Speaker 3: Asuka, this isn't the time for this.

272
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,040
Speaker 3: You always look so smug, too.

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,100
Speaker 3: Hey, just because they like you best doesn't mean you can act so superior.

274
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:57,740
Speaker 3: I

275
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,800
Speaker 2: don't act superior.

276
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,620
Speaker 2: And I'm not treated any better either.

277
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,180
Speaker 2: I know that quite well.

278
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,060
Speaker 8: Understood. The termination plug has been ejected, sir.

279
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,000
Speaker 8: Excellent.

280
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,520
Speaker 11: Prepare for manual insertion of the entry plug.

281
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,260
Speaker 11: But the pilots aren't here yet.

282
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,820
Speaker 4: Don't worry. They'll be along soon enough.

283
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,960
Speaker 4: There's no way I can

284
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,820
Speaker 12: clear this away with my

285
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,280
Speaker 2: hands.

286
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,160
Speaker 2: Then we will have to break into another ventilation duct in order to get there.

287
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,300
Speaker 3: First child's feeling aggressive, and I'll bet she'd do anything to stay number one.

288
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,920
Speaker 3: Some people just think they're better than others.

289
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,200
Speaker 5: Entry plug is fixed and ready.

290
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Speaker 4: Now all we need are the children.

291
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,780
Speaker 3: If you dare look up my dress, I'll kill you.

292
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,740
Speaker 3: Do you hear me, Shinji?

293
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Speaker 3: You look!

294
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:06,820
Speaker 3: I'm there!

295
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,380
Speaker 3: I told

296
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,240
you not to look!

297
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,520
What I'm done to the board is you!

298
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:11,800
Huh?

299
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,120
Speaker 4: Oh, that's where you've been.

300
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,820
Speaker 4: We've been waiting for you.

301
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,960
Speaker 11: Prepare for manual entry.

302
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,540
Speaker 11: Roger!

303
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,340
Speaker 11: Never open

304
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,180
the hatches!

305
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,360
Speaker 4: The Evas?

306
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Speaker 4: They're already on standby.

307
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,520
Speaker 4: Huh?

308
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,420
Speaker 4: But there's no power.

309
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,120
Speaker 4: It was all done by hand.

310
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,440
Speaker 4: The Commander did it.

311
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,140
Speaker 4: My father...

312
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,560
Speaker 4: Commander Akari believed in you and prepared everything.

313
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,640
*Gunshot

314
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,400
Speaker 11: Understood. Remove all of the remaining restraints and supports. Commence launch!

315
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,200
Speaker 3: The Angel has stopped directly above us!

316
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,360
Speaker 3: Hurry up! Get a move on!

317
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,440
Speaker 4: The emergency batteries have been engaged!

318
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,560
Speaker 4: Well, we're ready. Let's move out!

319
00:17:59,259 --> 00:17:59,940
Speaker 7: Oh!

320
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Speaker 3: This is pathetic!

321
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,140
Speaker 2: Vertical shaft in sight.

322
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,020
Speaker 2: Get out of the way!

323
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,100
Speaker 3: I can't believe we're doing this, it's so embarrassing.

324
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,580
Speaker 3: Huh?

325
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,420
Speaker 3: Huh?

326
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,040
Speaker 2: It's acid, watch out!

327
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,720
Speaker 2: Huh?

328
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:24,940
Speaker 2: Oh!

329
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm not sure

330
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,960
Speaker 2: It would appear that the Angel plans to attack headquarters directly using that acid.

331
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,000
Speaker 3: What do we do?

332
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,660
Speaker 3: What do we do?

333
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,140
Speaker 3: We're gonna

334
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,060
Speaker 13: beat it, of course!

335
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,220
Speaker 13: Okay, but how?

336
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,400
Speaker 13: We dropped our rifles and the battery packs on our backs are running out of power!

337
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,520
Speaker 13: They will last more than another three minutes!

338
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
Speaker 3: I've got an idea.

339
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,960
Speaker 3: There will be three positions: defense, offense, and backup.

340
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,180
Speaker 3: Defense's job will be to neutralize that Angel's AT field and to protect the offense from the acid bath.

341
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,940
Speaker 3: Backup will go down the shaft, retrieve the rifles, and hand one to the offense, who will then fire a volley, destroying the target.

342
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
Speaker 2: How does that sound?

343
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,860
Speaker 2: I will take the defensive position.

344
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,440
Speaker 3: Sorry, Wonder Girl!

345
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,860
Speaker 3: That'll be my job.

346
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,220
Speaker 3: But it's too dangerous.

347
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,400
Speaker 3: That's why I'm doing it. And don't forget I still owe you one from the last time we fought an Angel.

348
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,220
Speaker 3: Shinji will be offense. Rei will be the backup.

349
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,460
Speaker 3: Got it?

350
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:55,920
Speaker 3: Understood.

351
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,740
Speaker 3: Right, here we go.

352
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,800
Speaker 3: Ava, let's go!

353
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,120
Speaker 3: Oscar!

354
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,520
Speaker 3: Hey, Nami!

355
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,580
Speaker 3: Oscar, get out of the way!

356
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,220
Oscar!

357
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,200
Speaker 3: Now we're even, Shinji.

358
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,240
Speaker 3: Oh, no, please open,

359
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,800
Speaker 10: please.

360
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,280
Speaker 10: Why won't it open?

361
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,820
Speaker 10: Please, I've got to go to the bathroom now.

362
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,840
Speaker 10: Hey, you're not looking at my dress, are you?

363
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,460
Speaker 10: No,

364
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,060
Speaker 9: ma'am.

365
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,100
Speaker 7: Huh?

366
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,560
Speaker 7: Ah!

367
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,540
Speaker 5: Ah!

368
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:03,840
Speaker 5: Ah!

369
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,460
Speaker 5: Watch out!

370
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,160
Speaker 5: Ah!

371
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,780
Ah!

372
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,760
Ah!

373
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,220
Ah!

374
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,180
Ah!

375
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,820
Speaker 5: Sex fiends.

376
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,260
Speaker 12: It's ironic.

377
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,140
Speaker 12: Without electricity and artificial light, the sky can look so beautiful at

378
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,280
Speaker 3: night.

379
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,920
Speaker 3: Yeah, but without the lights, it seems like there are no humans here.

380
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,140
Speaker 3: There. I feel much more comfortable this way.

381
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,660
Speaker 2: Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire.

382
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,100
Speaker 2: Hmph.

383
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,360
Speaker 12: Philosophy, huh?

384
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Speaker 12: So is that what makes mankind a special species? Is that why the angels attack us?

385
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,180
Speaker 3: What are you, stupid? Who knows what they think?

386
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,580
Speaker 14: In other words, darling, kiss me

387
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,040
Speaker 14: Fill my heart with soul

388
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,280
Speaker 14: And let me sing forevermore

389
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,200
Speaker 14: You are all I want

390
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,140
Speaker 14: For all I want to adore

391
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,200
Speaker 14: In other words

392
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,680
Speaker 14: With this feature

393
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,480
Speaker 14: In other worlds

394
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,760
I love you

395
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,620
Speaker 10: When Misada was promoted to Major, Shinji begins to learn about her personal vendetta against the Angels.

396
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,260
Speaker 10: Then it's up to the Eva team to stop the largest and most dangerous Angel yet!

397
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,760
Speaker 10: The size of this creature alone makes many abandon all hope, and that's before it unveils its

398
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,800
Speaker 7: terrifying new weapon!
