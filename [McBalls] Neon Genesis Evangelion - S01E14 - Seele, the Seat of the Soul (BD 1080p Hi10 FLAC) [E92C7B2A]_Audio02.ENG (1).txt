Speaker 1
The young man I'm just looking at you, I'm smiling. I'm so happy to see you, I'm not even curious. I'm still not sure about you, but I'm not sure about you. But I'm sure you'll notice that The back of the future is a great place to look for the future The cruel and cruel world of the world will soon be The dark world will soon be on the edge of the world

The *Bad*

Speaker 2
Although there was a great deal of damage as a result, the fact that Shinji Ikari, a boy with no prior EVA experience, managed to accomplish the mission against an unknown enemy, deserves special notice. However, for the Department of Strategic Operations, it was a difficult battle that would reveal many problem areas that were in desperate need of improvement.

Speaker 3
*Gunshot so stupid. I'm gonna find the jerks who hurt my sister and teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

Speaker 4
We'd already had a lot of evacuation training at the school, so we didn't really think it was that serious. The guys were all acting like jerks as usual, like they were on a field trip, and none of the girls were afraid either.

Speaker 5
I'm not sure

*BANG* *Gunshot*

Speaker 6
Shinji never really told me what really happened, but if I had to guess, I'd say that Rei must have tried to sacrifice herself in order to protect Unit 1 from the enemy's particle beam. The reason I'm so sure about this is Rei herself. I don't think she has much respect for her own existence. She's not just pessimistic. Hell, a lot of kids our age are like that. No, it's something much, much more. But nobody ever tells me nothing. Then...

Speaker 7
*Ezio The United Nations combined Navy lost one third of its entire fleet in this encounter. At least the lost ships belong to your country. The damage is negligible.

Speaker 8
Quite true. It was fortunate that so much of the damage was inconsequential.

*Gunshot* YAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

*Squeak*

I'm sorry.

The End

*Gun

Speaker 9
Hmm, this isn't good. It's happening too early.

Speaker 8
Yes. This did not occur in accordance with our predictions of when an Angel would invade Nerv. And

Speaker 7
to make it worse, you let it intrude into Central Dogma itself. If contact had occurred, then our entire project

Speaker 8
could have ended in disaster, Ikari. The report to this committee was in error. There is no fact behind this tale of an Angel invasion.

Speaker 9
Ikari, are you saying that the Eleventh Angel's intrusion never occurred? Yes.

Speaker 8
Watch your words carefully, Ikari. Lying to this committee is perishable by death. If you wish confirmation, check the Magi's data recorders. No such incident was ever recorded.

Speaker 9
This is absurd.

Speaker 8
We all

Speaker 9
know that bearing the

Speaker 10
truth is your specialty. The time

Speaker 8
schedule is being carried out in accordance with the descriptions in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Speaker 10
Alright, we won't discuss any possible guilt or punishment this time. However, let me remind you that you won't rewrite our scenario.

Speaker 8
I understand. Everything is proceeding according to Zayle's plan.

Speaker 11
Mountains. Heavier the mountains. But that changes. With the passage of time. Sky. Blue sky. What your eyes can't see. What your eyes can see. The sun.

Speaker 1
One.

Speaker 11
Only one. Water. It is agreeable. Commander Ikari. Flowers. So many the same. So many without purpose. Sky. Sky of red. Red the color. The color I hate. The liquid flows. It drips, ripples and pours. Blood. A scent of blood, a woman who does not bleed. From the red soil the humans come. Humans made by man and woman. City, a human creation. Ava, a human creation as well. What are humans? Are they creations of God? Humans are that which is created by humans. This is that which is mine. My life. My heart. I am a vessel for my thoughts. The entry plug. Throne of the soul. Who is this? This is me. Who am I? What am I? What am I? What am I? I am I. This object that is, is myself. That which forms is me. This is the self that can be seen and yet this is not like that which is myself. A strange feeling. My body feels as if it is melting. I can no longer see myself. My form, my shape, fades from view. Awareness dawns of someone who is not me. Who is here, there, beyond me here. Shinji... This person I know, Major Katsuraki. Dr. Akaki. People. My classmates. The

Speaker 5
pilot of

Speaker 12
Unit 2.

Speaker 11
Commander Ikari? Who are you?

Speaker 12
Who are you? Who are you? So, Rei, how does it feel to be piloting Unit 1 for the first time?

Speaker 5
Smells like Ikari.

Speaker 13
The sync ratio is almost the same as with Unit Zero. Unit Zero and Unit One's personal data patterns are almost identical. That's what makes this sync experiment possible. Error margin is 0.03. Harmonics are normal. No detectable problems found for compatibility between Ray and Unit One. Okay,

Speaker 12
the test is over, Ray. You can get out now. Yes.

Speaker 2
*BANG* Subject status?

Speaker 13
A bit jittery, but no problems found in the nerve patterns.

Speaker 2
This is his first time in Unit Zero. His first time piloting another Ava. It's only natural.

Speaker 14
That's stupid. Why should he care which Ava he's in anyway? It makes a difference to Shinji. That's how he is. I know that. He's such a dork. So why aren't you running these compatibility tests on me? Is there something wrong with me? Well, we didn't think he'd want to pilot any Ava except

Speaker 2
yours.

Speaker 14
Yeah, that's

Speaker 2
true, isn't it? I don't know if Unit 2 would even be compatible.

Speaker 15
Beginning entry. LCL electrolyzed.

Speaker 12
Commence first connection.

Speaker 1
Shinji,

Speaker 13
how do you feel in Unit 0's entry plug?

Speaker 1
It feels kind of weird.

Speaker 15
Like incompatibility?

Speaker 1
Not like that. This thing

Speaker 12
smells like rain. It smells like what?

Speaker 14
That's a mensch.

Speaker 12
Data received. Reconfirming.

Speaker 13
Pattern green.

Speaker 12
All restraints are nominal.

Speaker 13
Acknowledged. Now let's shift the mutual compatibility test to the second stage. Unit zero, entering second contact. How's it look? As I thought. The sync ratio is lower than that of unit one. Hmm, harmonics are all normal. But these are still good readings. These numbers mean that we can implement our current plan. You mean the tummy system? Ma'am, I'm really not sure that we should proceed. I understand your feelings on this, but we always have to be prepared for all options. It's our guarantee of survival. You know that I've always respected you, ma'am, and I still believe in our work. But I'm afraid I'm really not convinced. People who develop too many scruples will always have some difficulty working amongst others. You'll learn once you've gotten your hands dirty. You'll see.

Speaker 16
*Gasp* Initiate third connection. Self-state of Minecraft is stable.

Speaker 13
It's Shinji missing Mama's breath. Has it been in her womb or what? Asuka, stop interrupting. You're being obnoxious.

Speaker 14
Yeah, yeah. I don't get it. Why does everyone around here always pamper him?

Speaker 13
Commence A10 nerve connections. Harmonics level plus 20.

Speaker 1
What the hell? Something's trying to get into my brain. Uh...

Speaker 11
Uh... W-Rei?

Speaker 12
Uh...Rei Ayanami? Ah... This feeling...impression... Rei... It's hers! What's happening?! There's

Speaker 7
a problem in the pilot's nerve pulse!

Speaker 12
Mental contamination starting! Impossible! This can't happen at this plug tap! It's not FROM the plug! The intrusion is coming from the angle! Unit zero is out of control! Shut all circuits! Cut the power! Ava switched to reserve power! Ava

Speaker 3
is still activated.

Speaker 12
Shinji status!

Speaker 3
The circuit's closed. We can't monitor him! Unit

Speaker 12
zero is rejecting Shinji. Negative! The auto-ejection! It doesn't work! The same error. The same one. Is it trying to absorb Shinji?

Speaker 15
Break it back here! Break it! Activation will terminate in seven seconds! Six, five, four,

Speaker 2
three, two, one, zero! Zero, activation terminated. Hurry up and get the pilot out of there! Did Unit Zero just try to kill Ray? Do you think this could be related to the incident that occurred when Ray was the pilot? I can't tell you much right now. The only thing I'm sure of is that we must reconfigure Unit Zero for Ray's personal data and run a new synchronization test between Ray and the Zero as soon as possible. As the director of operations, I request that it be done as soon as possible, before there are further problems. I understand that,

Speaker 13
Major Katsuragi. Right. Unit Zero wanted to attack me. That's got to be it.

Speaker 15
He said hello. Do you understand me? He said yeah. This is great. So what's the top of the house? He said room. And what's the texture of sandpaper there? This is amazing. He said rubbed. And who's

Speaker 1
the greatest baseball player of all time? Again, I hate this ceiling. The

Speaker 16
hospital says Shinji has regained consciousness.

Speaker 6
No signs of mental contamination. But he doesn't remember what happened.

Speaker 14
Right. Misato and Kashi won't tell me anything about her. Even Shinji doesn't know anything. Just what is the first child?

Speaker 16
The Angels' invasion of headquarters was a deviation from our scheduled scenario. The committees found out about it and are applying pressure. They're buzzing around

Speaker 8
our heads like a swarm of hornets, looking for things to complain about. We hold all the tiles, all the winds and dragons. There is nothing they can do. That doesn't mean we want to keep tipping

Speaker 16
our hand.

Speaker 8
If Sele starts to interfere,

Speaker 16
there could

Speaker 8
be trouble. Everything is going according to the scenario. No problems exist. What about

Speaker 16
the Unit Zero incident? That was not in our scenario. It will have no effect. Ray's

Speaker 8
resynchronization test was successful. You're too concerned about protecting Ray, Akari? What's the status of the ATOM project? Proceeding. It's less than 2% behind schedule. Then the Lance of Longinus is... Is going according to plan. Ray is handling the operation.

Speaker 17
We'll be right back. In other words, hold my hand In other words, darling kiss me Fill my heart with soul And let me sing forevermore You are all I love for all I love I love you Innu de mo, please be true Inna de mo, I

Speaker 18
love you With her friends getting married one after another, Misato starts to feel a little insecure Always a bridesmaid, she might just end up spending the rest of her life going to wedding showers and never finding anyone for herself. Could a reunion with Kashi be her last chance? In the next episode, the old

Speaker 5
biological clock goes tick, tick, tick.
