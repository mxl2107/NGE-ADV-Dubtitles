Asuka
I fear that I will disappear.

Shinji
I can disappear because I am unworthy of existing.

Rei
Why do you think this?

Asuka
Because I am worthless.

Shinji
I am unwanted. A useless child. You don't care about me anyway, do you?

Misato
Using that as an excuse is no different than running away. What you truly fear is failure, isn't it? You fear that you may be hated by others. You fear acknowledging that weakness even to yourself.

Shinji
How can you criticize me when you do the same thing?

Misato
You're right. At the core, we are all the same.

Ritsuko
Our minds lack something basic.

Asuka
And we fear that lack.

Misato
And that is why we are attempting to become one.

Asuka
We will meld with and fill each other.

Rei
This is the instrumentality.

Fuyutsuki
Mankind cannot live without being surrounded by others.

Gendo
Mankind cannot live alone.

Ritsuko
Although you yourself are always unique.

Kaji
That is why life is hard.

Asuka
That is why life is sad and empty.

Misato
Thus you want the close physical and mental presence of others.

Rei
That is why we wish to become one.

Fuyutsuki
The human soul is made of weak and fragile elements.

Ritsuko
The body and mind are made of brittle components as well.

Gendo
And so via the instrumentality, mankind must fill and complement each other. Must you ask? Because there's no other way to exist.

Rei
[clang] Why do you exist?

Asuka
Maybe I exist to find out why I exist.

Rei
For whom do you exist?

Asuka
For myself, of course.

Shinji
Maybe for myself.

Rei
Are you happy being alive?

Shinji
I don't know.

Rei
Are you happy being alive?

Asuka
Of course I'm happy!

Rei
Are you happy being alive?

Misato
I don't want to do anything except be happy.

Kaji
Do you hate being sad?

Shinji
I don't like it.

Kaji
Do you hate enduring pain?

Misato
I don't like it.

Kaji
Is that why you run away?

Misato
Yes. Do you blame me?

Asuka
What's wrong with running away from something that hurts?

Shinji
I mustn't run away!

Rei
Tell me why you mustn't run away.

Shinji
Because escaping from reality can be painful!

Rei
Even though you're running from something more painful?

Shinji
I couldn't bear it.

Asuka
As long as you know what the pain is, it can be endured.

Misato
That's correct. If the pain is too harsh, you can escape it.

Rei
If you really hate it, Shinji, you can still run.

Shinji
No, I won't. I'm tired of escaping. Yes, I mustn't run away.

Misato
That is true. That is because you are now aware that running only brings you more pain.

Asuka
This is because running away can be far worse.

Rei
That's why you do not wish to escape.

Shinji
Because if you run away, nobody will respect you. Don't leave me alone. Don't desert me, I'm begging you.

Ritsuko
There he goes again, depending upon others who do everything for him. That's a sad survival mechanism, isn't it?

Shinji
So what? It's better than being left all alone.

Asuka
Because you fear being hurt.

Misato
You try to make yourself believe that, don't you?

Kensuke
You're not the only one who gets hurt, Shinji.

Toji
Everybody feels pain. You aren't the only one.

Hikari
It's just easier for you to think that it's true, isn't it?

Shinji
Shut up! I don't care! Why should I? Nobody cares about me!

Misato
Once again, you've abandoned all sense of self-value, of self-worth.

Rei
I have nothing...

Asuka
There you go again, saying that you have no worth at all!

Misato
Do you believe that by not expecting anything, you won't get hurt either?

Asuka
Is that how you sustain your pathetic ego? By asking others to praise you?

Shinji
Nobody accepts me.

Misato
That's not true. You just believe that is so.

Shinji
And so that's why I must pilot the EVA.

Misato
Again, that is merely your point of view. You've been trying to convince yourself that you're worthless since the very beginning.

Shinji
But I have to! I've got to do it!

Kensuke
No, that's not true. You don't have to.

Toji
No, you just think you do.

Shinji
No, you're wrong. My life is pointless otherwise.

Asuka
And that's why you pilot the Eva?!

Shinji
Piloting Eva gives me an identity. A purpose.

Asuka
Piloting Eva gives me an identity. A purpose.

Shinji
I had no value before I became a pilot. The fact that I now pilot an Ava justifies my presence here.

Asuka
I have no other value.

Rei
I have no other value.

Shinji
I have no other value. No other value at all. I perceive no value in myself. I hate myself!

Asuka
You little worm! I hate you! I HATE YOU!

Toji
Me too! I hate you too!

Kensuke
I hate everything about you!

Hikari
I'm sorry, but... I hate you.

Ritsuko
I hate you!

Makoto
I hate you.

Shigeru
I hate you.

Maya
I hate everything about you.

Kaji
I hate you.

Shigeru
Oh Shinji, I... I hate you.

Shinji
See? Everyone hates me! Every person in existence must hate me!

Rei
No, that's just what you imagine.

Shinji
Yes! But that must be it because I hate myself!

Rei
Because you hate yourself, no one respects you.

Asuka
I hate you! I hate you! I hate everything!

Shinji
But they praise me. They're nice to me. When I pilot the AVA, they treat me better. Other people are being nice to me for the first time.

Rei
Which is your true feeling?

Shinji
I don't know. Or is it perhaps that both are my true feelings? So that's why you pilot the AVA? Because I have no choice. I only have the AVA.

Rei
Otherwise you could not retain your own identity.

Misato
In fact, AVA Unit 1 is part of your sense of being.

Ritsuko
But if you depend only on the Eva, then the Eva will become your only identifier.

Fuyutsuki
Eva will become your only value.

Misato
Without that value, you, the real you, will be erased from this existence.

Shinji
I don't care! I had no other value to start with anyway! I was learning to play the cello, but that didn't help me either!

Asuka
You just didn't discipline yourself! I didn't have to do that!

Shinji
But now that I can pilot the Eva...

Asuka
No. Soon you may lose your identity, as I have. Soon you may lose Eva and your self-worth.

Shinji
I pilot it because that's all I can do. Rain. Dark shadows of gloom hang above me. That's how I feel. This isn't how I want it to be.

Rei
This time is not the ending of life. This is not how I wish it to be.

Asuka
Morning. The beginning of a day. Another terrible day. I wish this wasn't the way it is.

Shinji
Blue sky... Something warm... Something... unfamiliar... Something that fills me with horror. I don't want this. I don't want it to be this way.

Asuka
I HATE EVERYTHING!

Misato
What do you want, Shinji?

Asuka
What do you want, Shinji?

Rei
What do you want, Shinji?

Asuka
DON'T HATE ME, PLEASE!

Shinji
What I fear is...

Rei
What I want

Asuka
is...

Shinji
Can I stay next to you?

Rei
May I stay here?

Asuka
Do you like me?

Little Asuka
Do you want to go where your mother is?

Asuka
No.

Little Shinji
Don't you want to go be with your father?

Shinji
No, I don't.

Little Rei
Why?

Little Shinji
Because I'm afraid of being hated.

Little Asuka
Because my identity might start to disappear.

Misato
What is it that you wish for?

Rei
What is it that you want?

Yui
You're very insecure, aren't you?

Shinji
To become secure, I have to have... value. I want to be worth something. I want to be worth enough to attract the attention of others.

Yui
But your value is something you have to find for yourself. You have to find it, Shenji.

Shinji
I have no value without it.

Asuka
My life is worthless without it.

Rei
Then what are you?

Shinji
Then what am I? What am I? Wait, what is this? This is me. This is the shape that lets others recognize me as myself. It is my symbol for myself. This is, this is, and this is as well. Representations. Everything is merely a description, not the real myself. Everything is simply a shape, a form, an identifier to let others recognize me as me. But then, what am I? Is this me? My true self? My fake self? What is it that I am?

Rei
You are you. There is little difference between how you interpret yourself and how the others interpret you.

Shinji
Right. My clothes, my shoes, my room, these are all parts of what makes up myself.

Rei
These things are connected through your consciousness.

Shinji
So what I think is me is me. What I recognize as self is myself. I'm no more and no less than the sum of my self-awareness. But I don't understand myself. Where am I? What am I? What am I? - Nobody understands me!

Asuka
- What are you, stupid? Of course nobody understands you. Nobody can ever understand you.

Misato
- The only one who can take care of you and understand you is you, yourself.

Rei
- So you must take care of yourself.

Shinji
- But I still don't understand myself! I don't even know what it is that makes me myself! How could I love myself? (Distorted) How could I love myself?

Misato
- You are still unstable. That is, the present you.

Asuka
- And the people around the present you.

Rei
- And the environment that surrounds the present you.

Misato
None of these elements of reality last forever.

Asuka
- Time continues to flow, and time brings change.

Rei
- Your world is in a state of constant change. You're capable of change any time your mind perceives these changes.

Shinji
- What is this? A world of nothing? A world with nobody in it?

Little Shinji
This is the world of perfect freedom.

Shinji
Freedom?

Little Shinji
Perfect freedom. A world in which you have no restriction.

Shinji
Is this really freedom?

Little Shinji
Yes. This is what it is.

Rei
However, this world has nothing in it.

Shinji
Unless I do something?

Misato
Right. Unless you do or think of something.

Shinji
But I don't know what to do or think of.

Rei
He is uncertain.

Asuka
He has no self-image to orient himself.

Hikari
There's nothing solid here.

Asuka
It is a world in which there are no obstacles, no anything.

Kaji
It is a world in which you can do anything you wish.

Misato
And yet, you are still afraid, aren't you?

Fuyutsuki
But you know what it is that you want to do.

Shinji
What should I do?

Gendo
Let me give you a restriction.

Asuka
There. Now you have a top and bottom.

Rei
But you have lost a degree of your freedom.

Misato
You may no longer fly. You must stand upon the Earth.

Kaji
But now you feel easier, don't you? Because you have less to trouble your mind.

Makoto
And now you can walk.

Maya
This is happening because you will it to be.

Shinji
Is this my will?

Ritsuko
This world with the floor is the only thing around yourself.

Toji
But now you can move around anywhere you wish to within it.

Kensuke
You could even turn the world upside down if you wanted to do that.

Hikari
And your perspective within your world is constantly changing.

Kaji
It changes with the passage of time.

Fuyutsuki
You change yourself as well.

Gendo
Because the thing that forms your shape is your mind, and its interaction with the world that surrounds you.

Ritsuko
You can do anything here, because this is your world. (Misato) This is the shape of our reality

Shinji
What is this? An empty space? An empty world? A world where nothing exists but myself? But with only myself, I have nothing to interact with. It's as if I'm here, but not here at all. It's as if I'm slowly fading out of existence.

Maya
Because only you are here.

Shinji
Only myself?

Maya
Without others to interact with, you cannot truly recognize your own image.

Shinji
My own image?

Misato
That's right. In the act of observing others, you may find and recognize yourself.

Asuka
Your self-image is restrained by having to observe the barriers between yourself and others. And yet, you cannot see yourself without the presence of others.

Shinji
Because there are others, I can perceive myself as an individual. If I am alone, then I will be the same without others. But if this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing!

Misato
By recognizing the differences between yourself and others, you establish your identity as yourself. (Rei) The very first other person, is your mother.

Asuka
Your mother is a different individual.

Shinji
Right. I am me and she is she. But are you really sure that the perceptions of others form my true self? (It's true, Shinki Ikari)

Asuka
Has it taken you this long to realize that? What an idiot! It's about time you got up, you idiot.

Shinji
- Oh, it's you, Asuka.

Asuka
- What the hell does that mean? Can't you appreciate that I went to the trouble of coming to wake you up personally? I don't hear any words of appreciation for your oldest childhood friend.

Shinji
- Uh. Thanks. Uh. Let me sleep a little more.

Asuka
- Hey, get up you! - It's time to get up you dork! Fwp (groaning) (gasping)

Shinji
(groaning)

Asuka
You stupid pervert, I didn't mean to get that up!

Shinji
- I can't help it, it's morning. I gotta, I gotta, take a whiz or something.

Asuka
OH DON'T POINT IT AT ME IT MIGHT GO OFF

Yui
- Oh my, Oscar's so sweet to come pick him up every morning and he doesn't appreciate it.

Gendo
- Hmm, is that so dear?

Yui
- Yes dear, and you have to get ready too.

Gendo
- I'm always ready, dear.

Yui
- Gosh, you are just like Shinji.

Gendo
- Mm-hmm, you ready?

Yui
- Anytime. I am the one who gets complaints from Professor Fuyutsuki if you're late for the meeting.

Gendo
- That's true, he's your biggest fan.

Yui
- Oh, you! Cut that out and get ready.

Gendo
- Yes, dear. She who must be obeyed.

Asuka
- Hurry up!

Shinji
- Geez, you're such a pain in the ass sometimes. Is this what happens when you start your period?

Asuka
- What? What did you say? (smack)

Shinji
- Ow!

Asuka
- Mrs. Ikari, we're leaving now.

Shinji
- Uh, bye, see you later, Mom.

Yui
- See you, sweetie. - Come on, dear, put the newspaper down.

Gendo
- All right.

Kensuke
(stuttering)

Asuka
All

Gendo
right.

(upbeat music)

(birds chirping)

Shinji
- Hey, isn't a new student starting today?

Asuka
- Yeah, that's right. - Since this city's going to become the new capital, there are a lot of people moving in. It's no wonder we're getting so many new kids.

Shinji
- That makes sense. I wonder what she's like. Oh, I hope she's got a great butt.

Rei
- Oh crap, I'm late. I can't be late for the first (b)ay.

Asuka
(panting)

Shinji
(screaming)

Rei
(screaming)

Asuka
(groaning) (groaning)

Rei
- I'm sorry, I'm really in a hurry, kid. I'm really sorry. Bye, see ya.

Toji
- Wow, so did you see her panties then?

Shinji
- Well, it wasn't a good look really. Just a little flash.

Toji
- Oh, I can't believe it that you're the one who has all the luck. (screaming) What'd you do that for?

Hikari
- Exactly what were you just talking about, Mr. Suzuhara? It's time to put that idle butt of yours to work. Change the water in the flower vases.

Toji
- Oh, she's mean.

Hikari
- Did you just say something?

Shinji
- Poor Toji's so carpetbagged. It's sad, isn't it?

Asuka
- Look who's talking.

Shinji
- Hey, are you saying that I'm--

Asuka
- I'm merely reporting the fact.

Shinji
- How so?

Asuka
- It just is, accept it.

Shinji
- Hey, why do you treat me like this?

Asuka
- Hey, that hurts, you idiot. - Oh, snap it, weasel.

Kensuke
The calm. Peace and tranquility. (static)

Toji
- Oh yeah!

Toji
(all exclaiming) - Misato our teacher! - Oh, she's gorgeous.

Asuka
(laughing) - Oh yeah! (all exclaiming)

Toji
- She's just the best! - Oh yeah!

Kensuke
- Yeah!

Asuka
- Just look at those three stooges.

Hikari
Have they no shame?

Hikari
(light music) - All right, stand up, bow, sit down.

Misato
- Listen up dudes, we've got a new blue haired babe here to introduce herself.

Rei
- My name's Rei Ayanami, how's it hanging?

Shinji
- No!

Rei
- Ah, you're the jerk who was staring at my panties!

Asuka
- Hey, what do you mean by that? You're the one who was flashing 'em, you know.

Rei
- Who are you and why are you defending him? Are you riding his balloony pony?

Asuka
- No, we're just really good childhood friends. You shut up!

Hikari
- Be quiet, you two, we're in a class, not a bar.

Misato
- Hey, this is more entertaining than class. Go on, I wanna see how this turns out.

Kensuke
(laughing) - Hey Shinji, you didn't tell me you were getting it with Asuka.

Shinji
- I see, so this is another possibility, another possible reality. This current myself is the same way. It's not the true myself. I can be any way I wish to be, I see. A myself who is not an Eva pilot can exist as well! [gunshot]

Misato
If you take that into consideration, then perhaps this world isn't that bad.

Shinji
Still, the reality itself might not be bad, but I could still hate myself.

Makoto
But it's your mind which takes reality and separates it into what's bad and hateful.

Shigeru
It is only the mind which separates reality from truth.

Maya
Any new position from which you view your reality will change your perception of its nature. It's all literally a matter of perspective.

Kaji
There are as many truths as there are people.

Kensuke
But there's only one truth that is your truth. That's the one that's formed from whatever point of view that you choose to view it from. It's a revised perception that protects you.

Toji
That's true. And one can have a perspective that's far too small.

Hikari
However, a person can only see things from the perspective that they choose to see them from.

Asuka
One must learn to judge things via the perceived truths that one receives from others.

Misato
For example, sunny days make you feel good.

Rei
Rainy days make you feel gloomy.

Asuka
If you are told this is so, then that is what you believe is so.

Ritsuko
But you can have fun on a rainy day as well.

Fuyutsuki
Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it. That's how fragile the truth for a human is.

Kaji
A person's truth is so simple that most ignore it to concentrate on what they think are deeper truths.

Gendo
You, for example, are simply unused to what it is to be liked by others.

Misato
You've never learned how to deal with fearing what others feel about you, and so you avoid it.

Shinji
But... don't the others hate me?

Asuka
What are you, stupid?! Haven't you realized it's all in your imagination, you mega-dork?!

Shinji
But... I hate myself.

Rei
One who truly hates himself cannot love. He cannot place his trust in another.

Shinji
I'm a coward. I'm cowardly, sneaky, and weak!

Misato
No. Only if you think you are, But if you know yourself, you can take care of yourself.

Shinji
I hate myself. But... but maybe... maybe I could love myself. Maybe my life could have a greater value. That's right! I am no more or less than myself. I am me! I want to be myself! I want to continue existing in this world! My life is worth living here!

Various
(cheering) Congratulations!

Shinji
Ah, thank you all.
