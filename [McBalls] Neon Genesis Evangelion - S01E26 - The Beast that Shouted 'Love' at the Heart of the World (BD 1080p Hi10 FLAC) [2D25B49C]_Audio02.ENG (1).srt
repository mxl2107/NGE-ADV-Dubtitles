1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:08,620
Speaker 1: As a poor man, like a young man,

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,800
Speaker 1: you will be a man.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,240
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:40,060
Speaker 1: Even though I'm just looking at

5
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,320
Speaker 1: The back of the back of the world is

6
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,780
Speaker 1: "You are a

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,960
Speaker 2: me anyway, do you? Using that as an excuse is no different than running away.

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Speaker 3: What you truly fear

9
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,820
Speaker 3: is failure, isn't it? You fear that you may be hated by others. You fear acknowledging that

10
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,000
Speaker 3: weakness even to yourself.

11
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,179
Speaker 2: How can you criticize

12
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,220
Speaker 3: me when you do the same thing? You're right. At

13
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,480
Speaker 3: the core, we are all the same. Our minds lack something basic. And we fear that lack. And that

14
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,820
Speaker 3: is why we are attempting to become one. We will meld with and fill each other. This is the

15
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,760
Speaker 3: Instrumentality.

16
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,960
Speaker 4: Mankind cannot live without being surrounded by others.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
Speaker 4: Mankind cannot live alone.

18
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,260
Speaker 3: Although you yourself are always unique.

19
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,980
Speaker 4: That is why life is hard.

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,900
Speaker 3: That is why life is sad and empty.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,940
Speaker 3: Thus you want the close physical and mental presence of others.

22
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,840
Speaker 3: That is why we wish to become one.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,700
Speaker 4: The human soul is made of weak and fragile

24
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,220
Speaker 5: elements.

25
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,720
Speaker 5: The body

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,000
Speaker 3: and mind are made of brittle components as well.

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,940
Speaker 5: And so, via the instrumentality, mankind must fill and complement each other.

28
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,300
Speaker 5: Must you ask? Because there's no other way to exist.

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,580
Why do you exist?

30
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,580
Speaker 3: Maybe I exist to find out why I exist.

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,140
Speaker 3: For whom do you exist?

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,300
Speaker 3: For myself, of course.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
Speaker 3: Maybe for myself.

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,060
Speaker 3: Are you happy being alive?

35
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,280
Speaker 2: I don't know.

36
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,360
Speaker 3: Are you happy being alive?

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
Speaker 3: Of course I'm happy!

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,520
Speaker 3: Are you happy being alive?

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,020
Speaker 3: I don't want to do anything except be happy.

40
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,620
Speaker 4: Do you hate being sad?

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,660
Speaker 6: I don't like it.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,940
Speaker 4: Do you hate enduring pain?

43
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,620
Speaker 3: I don't like it.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,440
Speaker 5: Is that why you run away?

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,500
Speaker 3: Yes. Do you blame me?

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,200
Speaker 3: What's wrong with running away from something that hurts?

47
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,480
Speaker 3: I mustn't run away.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,480
Speaker 3: Tell me why you mustn't run away.

49
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,660
Speaker 3: Because escaping from reality can be painful.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,900
Speaker 3: Even though you're running from something more painful.

51
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,620
Speaker 3: I couldn't bear it.

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,460
Speaker 3: As long as you know what the pain is, it can be endured.

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Speaker 3: That's correct.

54
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,860
Speaker 3: If the pain is too harsh, you can escape it.

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,060
Speaker 3: If you really hate it, Shinji, you can still run.

56
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,320
Speaker 2: No, I won't. I'm

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,100
Speaker 3: tired of escaping.

58
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,940
Speaker 3: Yes, I mustn't run

59
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,200
Speaker 1: away.

60
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,720
Speaker 3: That is true. That is because you are now aware that running only brings you more pain.

61
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,340
Speaker 3: This is because running away can be far worse.

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,380
Speaker 3: That's why you do not wish to escape.

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,320
Speaker 2: Because if you run away, nobody will respect you.

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,420
Speaker 2: Don't leave me alone.

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,720
Speaker 2: Don't deserve me. I'm begging you.

66
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,019
Speaker 2: There he goes again, depending upon others who do everything for him.

67
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
Speaker 2: That's a sad survival mechanism, isn't it?

68
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,480
Speaker 2: So what? It's better than being left all alone.

69
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,620
Speaker 2: Because you fear being hurt.

70
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Speaker 2: You try to make

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Speaker 3: yourself believe that,

72
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,460
Speaker 7: don't you?

73
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,440
Speaker 8: You're not the only one who gets hurt, Shinji.

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,700
Speaker 8: Everybody feels pain. You aren't the only one.

75
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,800
Speaker 7: It's just easier for you to think that it's true, isn't it?

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,100
Speaker 7: Shut up! I don't care!

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,140
Speaker 7: Why should

78
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,760
Speaker 3: I? Nobody cares about me!

79
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,400
Speaker 3: Once again, you've abandoned all sense of self-value, of self-worth.

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,020
Speaker 3: I have nothing.

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,580
Speaker 3: There you

82
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,760
Speaker 1: go again, saying

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,400
Speaker 3: that you have no worth at all.

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,740
Speaker 3: Do you believe that by not expecting anything, you won't get hurt either?

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,420
Speaker 3: Is that how you sustain your pathetic ego, by asking others to praise you?

86
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
Speaker 2: Nobody accepts me.

87
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,840
Speaker 3: That's not true. You just believe that is so.

88
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,160
Speaker 3: And so that's why I must pilot the Ava.

89
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,040
Speaker 3: Again, that is merely your point of view.

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,300
Speaker 3: You've been trying to convince yourself that you're worthless since the very beginning.

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,680
Speaker 3: But I have to! I've got to do it!

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,220
Speaker 8: No, that's not true.

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,460
Speaker 8: You don't have to.

94
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,080
Speaker 8: No, you just think you do.

95
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,400
Speaker 8: No, you're wrong.

96
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,480
Speaker 2: My life is pointless otherwise.

97
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,100
Speaker 2: And that's why you pilot the Ava?

98
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,140
Speaker 2: Piloting Ava gives me an identity. A purpose.

99
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,600
Speaker 2: Piloting Ava gives me an identity. A purpose.

100
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,920
Speaker 2: I had no value before I became a pilot.

101
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,440
Speaker 2: The fact that I now pilot an Ava justifies my presence here.

102
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,520
Speaker 2: I have no other

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,920
Speaker 3: value.

104
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,680
Speaker 3: I have no other value.

105
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,300
Speaker 2: I have no other value, no other value at all.

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,160
Speaker 2: I perceive no value in myself.

107
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Speaker 2: I hate myself!

108
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,700
YOU LILTLE WORM! I HATE YOU!

109
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,640
Speaker 8: I HATE YOU!

110
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,900
Speaker 8: Me, too.

111
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,140
Speaker 8: I hate you, too.

112
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,360
Speaker 8: I hate everything about you!

113
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,160
Speaker 3: I'm sorry but...

114
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,760
Speaker 3: I HATE YOU!

115
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,220
Speaker 3: I HATE YOU!

116
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,220
Speaker 3: I

117
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,760
Speaker 4: hate you, I hate you.

118
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,920
Speaker 9: I hate everything about you,

119
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,100
Speaker 4: I hate you.

120
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,940
Speaker 9: Oh Shinji, I hate you.

121
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,540
Speaker 2: See? Everyone hates me!

122
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,780
Speaker 2: Every person in existence must hate me!

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,560
Speaker 2: No, that's just what you imagine.

124
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
Speaker 2: Yes! But that must be it, because I hate myself!

125
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,540
Speaker 3: Because you hate yourself, no one respects you.

126
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,600
Speaker 3: I hate

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
you! I hate you! I hate everything!

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,540
Speaker 2: But they praise me. They're nice to me.

129
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,820
Speaker 2: When I pilot the Eva, they treat me better.

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,940
Speaker 2: Other people are being nice to me for the first time.

131
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,480
Speaker 2: Which is your true feeling?

132
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,320
Speaker 2: I don't know. Or is it perhaps that both are my true feelings?

133
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,440
Speaker 2: So that's why you pilot the Ava?

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,240
Speaker 2: Because I have no choice. I only have the Ava.

135
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,720
Speaker 2: Otherwise,

136
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,300
Speaker 3: you could not retain your own identity.

137
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,540
Speaker 3: In fact, Ava Unit 1 is part of your sense of being.

138
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Speaker 3: But if you depend only on the Ava, then the Ava will become your only identifier.

139
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,040
Speaker 8: Ava will become your only value.

140
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Speaker 3: Without that value, you, the real you, will be erased from this existence.

141
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,340
Speaker 2: I don't care! I had no other value to start with anyway!

142
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,760
Speaker 2: I was learning to play the cello, but that didn't help me either!

143
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,060
Speaker 3: You just didn't discipline yourself! I didn't have to do that!

144
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 2: But now that I can pilot the Ava...

145
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,880
Speaker 2: No. Soon you may lose your identity,

146
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,380
Speaker 3: as I have. Soon you may lose Ava and your self-worth.

147
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,440
Speaker 2: I pilot it

148
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,380
Speaker 3: because that's all I can

149
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,680
Speaker 2: do.

150
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:43,780
Speaker 6: Rain.

151
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,860
Speaker 6: Dark shadows of gloom hang above me.

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,740
Speaker 6: That's how I feel.

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
Speaker 6: This isn't how I want it to be.

154
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,960
Speaker 3: This is not the ending of love.

155
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,960
Speaker 3: This is not how I wish it to be.

156
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:57,900
Speaker 6: Morning.

157
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,840
Speaker 3: The beginning of a day.

158
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,840
Speaker 3: Another terrible day.

159
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,860
Speaker 3: I wish this wasn't the way it is.

160
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,120
Speaker 2: The sky. Something warm. Something unfamiliar. Something that fills me with horror.

161
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,820
Speaker 2: I don't want this. I don't want it to be this way.

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Speaker 2: I hate everything!

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,780
Speaker 2: What do you want, Shinji?

164
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,440
Speaker 3: What do you want, Shinji?

165
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,120
Speaker 3: What do you want, Shinji?

166
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,060
Speaker 3: Don't

167
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,240
hate me, please!

168
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,440
Speaker 3: What I fear is...

169
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,100
Speaker 3: What I want

170
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,700
Speaker 2: is...

171
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,140
Speaker 2: Can I stay next to you?

172
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,820
Speaker 2: May I stay here?

173
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
Speaker 3: Do you like me?

174
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,159
Speaker 3: Do you want to go where your mother is?

175
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:42,900
Speaker 3: No.

176
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,820
Speaker 3: Don't you want to go be with your father?

177
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,680
Speaker 2: No, I don't.

178
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,200
Speaker 3: Why?

179
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,140
Speaker 3: Because I'm afraid of being hated.

180
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,160
Speaker 3: Because my identity might start to disappear.

181
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,640
Speaker 3: What is it that you wish for?

182
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,300
Speaker 3: What is it that you want?

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,320
Speaker 2: You're very insecure, aren't you?

184
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,800
Speaker 2: To become secure, I have to have...

185
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:07,760
Speaker 2: Value!

186
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,400
Speaker 2: I want to be worth something!

187
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,260
Speaker 2: I want to be worth enough to attract the attention of others!

188
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,360
Speaker 10: But your value is something you have to find for yourself.

189
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,440
Speaker 10: You have to find it, Genji.

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,980
Speaker 2: I have no value without it.

191
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,160
Speaker 2: My life is worthless without it.

192
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,220
Speaker 3: Then what am I?

193
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,700
Speaker 2: Then what am I?

194
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 3: What am

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,680
Speaker 11: I?

196
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,960
Speaker 2: Wait, what is this? This is me. This is the shape that lets others recognize me as myself.

197
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,920
Speaker 2: It is my symbol for myself. This is, this is, and this is as well. Representations. Everything is

198
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Speaker 2: merely a description, not the real myself. Everything is simply a shape, a form, an identifier to let

199
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,060
Speaker 2: others recognize me as me. But then, what am I? Is this me? My true self? My fake self? What is it

200
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,640
Speaker 2: that I am?

201
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,140
Speaker 3: You are you. There is little difference between how

202
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,679
Speaker 2: you interpret yourself and how the

203
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:09,160
Speaker 2: others interpret you. Right. My clothes, my shoes, my room. These are all parts of what makes up

204
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:16,140
Speaker 2: myself. These things are connected through your consciousness. So what I think is me is me. What

205
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,360
Speaker 2: I recognize as self is myself. I'm no more and no less than the sum of my self-awareness,

206
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,220
Speaker 2: but I don't understand myself. Where am I? What am I?

207
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Speaker 2: Nobody understands

208
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,680
Speaker 11: me!

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
Speaker 3: What are you, stupid? Of course nobody understands you!

210
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,140
Speaker 3: Nobody can ever understand you!

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,500
Speaker 3: The only one who can take care of you and understand you is... you, yourself.

212
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,100
Speaker 3: So you must take care of yourself.

213
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,840
Speaker 2: But I still don't understand myself! I don't even know what it is that makes me myself!

214
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,679
Speaker 2: How could I love myself?!

215
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,720
Speaker 3: You are still unstable.

216
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,660
Speaker 3: That is, the present you.

217
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,920
Speaker 3: And the people around the present you.

218
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,920
Speaker 3: And the environment that surrounds the present you.

219
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,220
Speaker 3: None of these elements of reality last forever.

220
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,920
Speaker 3: Time continues to flow, and time brings change.

221
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,560
Speaker 3: Your world is in a state of constant change.

222
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,480
Speaker 3: You're capable of change any time your mind perceives these changes.

223
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Speaker 2: What is this?

224
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,360
Speaker 2: A world of nothing?

225
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,740
Speaker 2: A world with nobody in it?

226
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,240
Speaker 2: This is the world of perfect freedom.

227
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,440
Speaker 2: Freedom?

228
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,660
Speaker 2: Perfect

229
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,180
freedom. A world in which you have no restriction.

230
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Speaker 3: Is this really freedom?

231
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,620
Speaker 3: Yes. This is what it is.

232
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,600
Speaker 3: However, this world has nothing in it.

233
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,060
Speaker 2: Unless I do something?

234
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,620
Speaker 3: Right. Unless you do or think of something.

235
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,460
Speaker 3: But I don't know what to do or think of.

236
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,560
Speaker 3: He is uncertain.

237
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,280
Speaker 3: He has no self-image to orient himself.

238
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,880
Speaker 3: There's nothing solid here.

239
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,100
Speaker 3: It is a world in which there are no obstacles, no anything.

240
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,080
Speaker 3: And yet, you are still afraid, aren't you?

241
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,680
Speaker 3: What should I do?

242
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,120
Speaker 5: Let me give you a restriction.

243
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,960
Speaker 3: There. Now you have a top and bottom.

244
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,260
Speaker 3: But you have lost a degree of your freedom.

245
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,040
Speaker 3: You may no longer fly. You must stand upon the earth.

246
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,260
Speaker 5: But now you feel easier, don't you?

247
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,740
Speaker 5: Because you have less to trouble your mind.

248
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,440
Speaker 5: And now you can walk.

249
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,940
Speaker 9: This is happening because you will it to be.

250
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,200
Speaker 9: Is this my will?

251
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,800
Speaker 9: This world with the floor is the only thing around yourself.

252
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,740
Speaker 8: But now you can move around anywhere you wish to within it.

253
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Speaker 8: You could even turn the world upside down if you wanted to do that.

254
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,100
Speaker 3: And your perspective within your world is constantly changing.

255
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,080
Speaker 8: It changes with the

256
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,820
Speaker 5: passage of time.

257
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,160
Speaker 5: Because the thing that forms your shape is your mind

258
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,180
Speaker 5: and its interaction with the world that surrounds you.

259
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,260
Speaker 2: You can do anything here, because this is your world.

260
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 2: This

261
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,080
is the shape of reality.

262
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Reality.

263
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,820
Speaker 2: What is this?

264
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,480
Speaker 2: An empty space?

265
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,100
Speaker 2: An empty world?

266
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,740
Speaker 2: A world where nothing exists but myself?

267
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,560
Speaker 2: But with only myself, I have nothing to interact with.

268
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,440
Speaker 2: It's as if I'm here, but not here at all.

269
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,480
Speaker 2: It's as if I'm slowly fading out of existence.

270
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,260
Speaker 2: Because only you are here.

271
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,620
Speaker 2: Only myself?

272
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,600
Speaker 2: Without others to interact with, you cannot truly recognize your own image.

273
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,280
Speaker 2: My own image?

274
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Speaker 3: That's right. In the act of observing others, you may find and recognize yourself.

275
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,520
Speaker 3: Your self-image is restrained by having to observe the barriers between yourself and others.

276
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,900
Speaker 3: And yet, you cannot see yourself without the presence of others.

277
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,840
Speaker 2: Because there are others, I can perceive myself as an individual.

278
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,660
Speaker 2: If I am alone, then I will be the same without others.

279
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:48,940
Speaker 2: For

280
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,140
Speaker 3: if this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing!

281
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,020
Speaker 3: By recognizing the differences between yourself and others, you establish your identity as yourself.

282
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,720
Speaker 3: Your mother

283
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,020
Speaker 2: is

284
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,940
Speaker 3: a different individual.

285
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,080
Speaker 2: Right. I am me and she is she.

286
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,940
Speaker 2: But are you really sure that the perceptions of others form my true self?

287
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,360
Speaker 3: Has it taken you this long to realize that?

288
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,200
Speaker 3: What an idiot!

289
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,700
Speaker 3: Huh?

290
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,400
Speaker 3: It's about time you got up, you idiot.

291
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,720
Speaker 6: Oh, it's you, Asuka.

292
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,820
Speaker 3: What the hell does that mean?

293
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,340
Speaker 3: Can't you appreciate that I went to the trouble of coming

294
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,560
Speaker 3: to wake you up personally?

295
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
Speaker 3: I don't hear any words of appreciation

296
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,080
Speaker 3: for your oldest childhood friend.

297
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,900
Speaker 2: Oh, thanks.

298
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,080
Speaker 2: Let me sleep a little more.

299
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,760
Speaker 2: Hey,

300
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:45,600
Speaker 3: get up, you!

301
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,800
Speaker 3: It's time to get up, you dark!

302
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,840
Speaker 12: You stupid bird!

303
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,980
Speaker 12: I didn't mean to get that up!

304
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,680
Speaker 12: I can't help it.

305
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,240
Speaker 12: It's morning.

306
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,080
Speaker 12: I gotta take a whiz or something.

307
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,140
Speaker 10: Oh, my.

308
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,000
Speaker 10: Oscar's so sweet to come pick him up every morning,

309
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,760
Speaker 10: and he doesn't appreciate it.

310
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,100
Speaker 5: Hmm.

311
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,580
Speaker 5: Is that so, dear?

312
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,980
Speaker 10: Yes, dear.

313
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,820
Speaker 10: And you have to get ready, too.

314
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,940
Speaker 5: I'm always ready, dear.

315
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,900
Speaker 10: Gosh, you are just like Shinji.

316
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,760
Speaker 5: Mm-hmm. You ready?

317
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,620
Speaker 10: Anytime.

318
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,920
Speaker 10: I am the one who gets complaints from Professor Fuyutsuki if you're late for the meeting.

319
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,840
Speaker 5: That's true. He's your biggest fan.

320
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,320
Speaker 5: Oh,

321
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,760
Speaker 10: you? Cut that out and

322
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,540
Speaker 12: get ready.

323
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,900
Speaker 5: Yes, dear. She who must be obeyed.

324
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,620
Speaker 12: Hurry up!

325
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,160
Speaker 12: Jeez, you're such a pain in the ass sometimes.

326
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,520
Speaker 12: Is this what happens when you start your period?

327
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,880
Speaker 12: What?

328
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,080
Speaker 3: What did you say?

329
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,080
Speaker 3: Ow!

330
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,980
Speaker 3: Mrs. Zucari, we're leaving now.

331
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,920
Speaker 3: Uh, see you later, Mom.

332
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Speaker 3: See you, sweetie.

333
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,040
Speaker 3: Come

334
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,960
Speaker 10: on, dear. Put the newspaper down.

335
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,200
Speaker 10: Uh,

336
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,460
Speaker 8: all

337
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:57,980
Speaker 3: right.

338
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,480
Speaker 3: Hey, isn't a new student starting today?

339
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,020
Speaker 3: Yeah, that's right.

340
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,100
Speaker 3: Since this city's going to become the new capital,

341
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,520
Speaker 3: There are a lot of people moving in.

342
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,540
Speaker 3: It's no wonder we're getting so many new kids.

343
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,520
Speaker 3: - That makes sense.

344
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,880
Speaker 3: I wonder what she's like.

345
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,640
Speaker 3: Oh, I hope she's got a great butt.

346
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,700
Speaker 3: - Oh crap, I'm late.

347
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,220
Speaker 3: I can't be late for the first day.

348
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,280
Speaker 11: I'm sorry! I'm really in a hurry, kid!

349
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,180
Speaker 11: I'm really sorry!

350
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,640
Speaker 11: Bye, dear!

351
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,040
Speaker 3: Wow! So did you

352
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,020
Speaker 2: see her panties then?

353
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,200
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't a good look really.

354
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 2: Just a little flash.

355
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,220
Speaker 8: Oh! I can't believe it that you're the one who has all the luck!

356
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,939
Speaker 8: What'd you do that for?

357
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,319
Speaker 7: Exactly what were you just talking about, Mr. Suzuhara?

358
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,079
Speaker 7: It's time to put that idle butt of yours to work!

359
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,760
Speaker 7: Change the water in the flower vases!

360
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,939
Speaker 7: Oh, she's

361
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:17,280
Speaker 3: mean!

362
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Speaker 7: Did you just say something?

363
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,900
Speaker 2: Poor Toji's so carpet-bagged.

364
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,020
Speaker 2: It's sad, isn't it?

365
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,339
Speaker 2: Look who's talking.

366
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,680
Speaker 2: Hey, are you saying that I'm...

367
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,420
Speaker 2: I'm merely reporting the fact.

368
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,280
Speaker 1: How so?

369
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,520
Speaker 1: It

370
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,900
Speaker 2: just

371
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,240
Speaker 3: is! Accept it!

372
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,160
Speaker 3: Hey, why do you treat me like this?

373
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,600
Speaker 3: Hey, that hurts, you idiot!

374
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,100
Speaker 3: Ow,

375
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,500
Speaker 8: Stan!

376
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,960
Speaker 8: The calm, the peace and tranquility.

377
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,920
Speaker 8: *Bang*

378
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,840
*Bang*

379
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,160
*Bang*

380
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,620
Speaker 3: Oh yeah!

381
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,340
Speaker 13: Miss Residdle our teacher!

382
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,160
Speaker 3: Oh, she's gorgeous!

383
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,760
Speaker 3: Wow!

384
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,300
Speaker 3: Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Look at that!

385
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,220
Speaker 13: Oh! She just... the best!

386
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,260
Speaker 13: Oh yeah!

387
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,400
Speaker 3: Just look at those three stooges!

388
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,880
Speaker 3: Have they no shame!

389
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,180
Speaker 3: *Bang*

390
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,640
Speaker 3: Listen up dudes, we've got a new blue haired babe here to introduce herself.

391
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,880
Speaker 3: My name's Rei Ayanami. How's it hanging?

392
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,560
Speaker 3: No!

393
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,420
Speaker 3: You're the jerk who was staring at my panties!

394
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,160
Speaker 3: Hey! What do you mean by that? You're the one who was flashing them, you know.

395
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,020
Speaker 3: Who are you and why are you defending him? Are you riding his baloney pony?

396
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,380
Speaker 13: No!

397
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,580
Speaker 3: We're just really good childhood friends! You shut up!

398
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,480
Speaker 3: Be quiet you two, we're in a class, not a bar.

399
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,080
Speaker 3: Hey, this is more entertaining than class.

400
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,200
Speaker 3: Go on, I want to see how this turns out.

401
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,540
Speaker 3: Hey, Shinji, you didn't

402
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,040
Speaker 8: tell me you were

403
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,060
Speaker 3: getting it with Asuka.

404
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,000
Speaker 2: I see.

405
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,040
Speaker 2: So this is another possibility.

406
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,860
Speaker 2: Another possible reality.

407
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,100
Speaker 2: This current myself is the same way.

408
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,480
Speaker 2: It's not the true myself.

409
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,680
Speaker 2: I can be any way I wish to be.

410
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,300
Speaker 2: I see.

411
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,640
Speaker 2: And myself, who is not an Ava pilot, can exist as well.

412
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,040
Speaker 2: If you take that into consideration,

413
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,500
Speaker 2: then perhaps this world isn't that bad.

414
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,140
Speaker 2: Still, the reality itself might not be bad,

415
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,880
Speaker 2: but I could still hate myself.

416
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,880
Speaker 8: But it's your mind which takes reality and separates it

417
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,200
Speaker 8: into what's bad and hateful.

418
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,220
Speaker 8: It is only the mind which separates reality from truth.

419
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,040
Speaker 9: Any new position from which you view your reality

420
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,040
Speaker 9: will change your perception of its nature.

421
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,060
Speaker 9: It's all literally a matter of perspective.

422
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,120
Speaker 3: There are as many

423
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,020
Speaker 4: truths as

424
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,640
Speaker 8: there are people.

425
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,040
Speaker 8: But there's only one truth that is your truth.

426
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,260
Speaker 8: That's the one that's formed from whatever point of view

427
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,800
Speaker 8: to view it from. It's a revised perception that protects you.

428
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
Speaker 8: That's true, and one can have a perspective that's far too small.

429
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,340
Speaker 3: However, a person can only see things from the perspective that they choose to see them from.

430
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Speaker 3: One must learn to judge things via the perceived truths that one receives from others.

431
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,220
Speaker 3: For example, sunny days make you feel good.

432
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,040
Speaker 3: Rainy days make you feel gloomy.

433
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,560
Speaker 3: If you are told this is so, then that is what you believe is so.

434
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,160
Speaker 3: But you can have fun on a rainy day as well.

435
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,060
Speaker 4: Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it.

436
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,820
Speaker 4: That's how fragile the truth for a human is.

437
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,760
Speaker 5: A person's truth is so simple that most ignore it to concentrate on what they think are deeper truths.

438
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,620
Speaker 5: You, for example, are simply unused to what it is to be liked by others.

439
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,800
Speaker 3: You've never learned how to deal with fearing what others feel about you, and so you avoid it.

440
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,880
Speaker 3: But... don't the others hate me?

441
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Speaker 3: What are you, stupid? Haven't you realized it's all in your imagination, you mega-dork?

442
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,940
Speaker 2: But I hate myself.

443
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,640
Speaker 3: One who truly hates himself cannot love. He cannot place his trust in another.

444
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,520
Speaker 2: I'm a coward. I'm cowardly, sneaky, and weak.

445
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,320
Speaker 2: No. Only if you think you are, but if you know yourself, you can take care of yourself.

446
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,420
Speaker 2: I hate myself.

447
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,800
Speaker 2: But maybe I could love myself.

448
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,940
Speaker 2: Maybe my life could have a greater value.

449
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,660
Speaker 2: That's right.

450
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,700
Speaker 2: I am no more or less than myself.

451
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Speaker 2: I am me.

452
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,060
Speaker 2: I want to be myself.

453
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,700
Speaker 2: I want to continue existing in this world.

454
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,160
Speaker 2: My life is worth living here.

455
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,920
Speaker 11: Yay!

456
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,600
Speaker 11: You're the best!

457
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,100
Speaker 3: Congratulations!

458
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,520
Speaker 3: Congratulations!

459
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:34,880
Speaker 3: Congratulations!

460
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,260
Speaker 3: Congratulations!

461
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,020
Speaker 2: Thank you all!

462
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,760
Speaker 11: I'm

463
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:23,600
not alone.

464
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,900
Speaker 11: In other words, truly kiss me

465
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,960
Speaker 11: Feel my heart with song

466
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,740
Speaker 11: And let me sing forevermore

467
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,440
Speaker 11: You are all I long for

468
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,920
Speaker 11: All I want, sit and adore

469
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,520
Speaker 11: In other words

470
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,560
Speaker 11: Please be true

471
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,420
Speaker 11: In other words

472
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,880
I love you
