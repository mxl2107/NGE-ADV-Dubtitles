Speaker 1
The young man like a young man You are a young man, you are a young man The wind is now on the door I'm just looking at you I'm so happy

Speaker 2
This

Speaker 3
is Ecta64 calling the

Speaker 2
end of the world. Neopat 400, confirm cumulonimbus clouds in your immediate flight path, over. This is Neopat 400, cumulonimbus clouds confirmed. Parameter indicates no hazard. We'll maintain course. Expect to arrive on schedule. This is Ecta 64. Roger it out.

Speaker 4
I'm ready. Where's Asuka? She's taken off already. It would seem that

Speaker 5
she doesn't want to face us right now. But why? A teenage girl can be difficult to understand, Shinji.

Speaker 3
By the way... Um, well...

Speaker 4
Well, go ahead. Are the rumors about Unit 4 really true? I heard that there was some kind of accident and it exploded.

Speaker 5
Yes, I'm afraid so. Unit 4 is gone, alone with the second branch of nerve. It happened while they were testing the S2 engine. But don't worry, we'll be all right. All three of our Avas are functioning properly, And our pilots

Speaker 4
and staff are in good shape, too. I also heard that Unit 3 is being brought here. You're performing the activation tests at Matsushiro, aren't you?

Speaker 5
Uh-huh. I'll be out for four days or so, but don't worry. Akashi's coming over to take care of you guys.

Speaker 4
But what about the test?

Speaker 5
Oh, Ritsuko will be supervising everything. There won't be any problems.

Speaker 4
And who will be the pilot?

Speaker 5
Well, the pilot is...

Speaker 6
Yes. Good morning, Major Katsuragi. I've come to ask for your help. I'm begging you. Please, please. You've just got to choose me as the pilot for Evangelion Unit 3. You gotta!

Speaker 7
So, Shinji still doesn't know, huh? I just can't find a chance to tell him. I'm worried. Sometimes I just can't figure out what he's

Speaker 5
thinking about. Oh,

Speaker 7
get a grip, kid. You're the one who wanted to be his guardian.

Speaker 5
Yeah, you're right, of course. Um, so, when will you acquire the new pilot?

Speaker 7
Tomorrow. There's still a few details to be ironed out. Maybe the new pilot will tell Shinji himself. Oh, I rather doubt it. This one wasn't very enthused about the prospect at all. He won't talk. He only accepted under the condition that his younger sister be transferred into our private hospital.

Speaker 6
How can Miss Otto be so cruel? I'm dying to be pilot, so why won't she use me? Even as a backup pilot, it's just not fair.

Speaker 8
Yeah.

Speaker 4
Hey, what's up? You left before me, but you're getting here late.

Speaker 8
No fight between the newlyweds today?

Speaker 9
I just didn't want to see your ugly faces! You damn three students! Oh, for dust, idiot!

Speaker 6
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah, the precious moment of lunchtime. Hey, where's Toji? I haven't seen him. You mean he left? Without his lunch? Toji the stomach?

Speaker 4
That's impossible! Well, he's been acting different. Mr. Susahoe?

Speaker 8
Oh, it's you, Ayanami. If you're looking for Shinji, he's not here. You know, don't you, about everything? I think Asuka knows, too. So Shinji's the only one who doesn't know. You know, it's pretty rare for you to be concerned about someone else.

Speaker 10
It is? I'm not sure I understand.

Speaker 8
Oh, you have a thing about Shinji, all right.

Speaker 10
I? Maybe that

Speaker 4
is true.

Speaker 8
You do.

Speaker 4
- Hikari! - Let's have lunch

Speaker 5
together! Okay. He's over two hours late,

Speaker 7
but at last he's finally here. This is the first time I've ever waited for someone this long. That's because you never waited for guys back when you could still get a date. Oh, shut up.

Speaker 11
This was the so-called second impact. At that time, I was living in a place called Nebukawa, but the rising water levels caused by the melting of Antarctica have buried it beneath the sea.

Speaker 8
I'm sorry, newcomer, but I had to clobber you. I had to beat you to work off my own anger.

Speaker 10
Um, I'm sorry, Asuka. You usually walk home with Shinji, don't you?

Speaker 9
I only walk with Shinji because we work together. And right now I don't be like looking at him. Oh.

Speaker 10
This is about

Speaker 9
Toji, isn't it? Yeah, how'd you know? Everybody knows. The Three Stooges are the only ones who don't.

Speaker 10
Shinji seems sensitive in a naive kind

Speaker 9
of way. Shinji's a big fat dork! And he's denser than lead, too. He wouldn't know how to relate to another person if you gave him a manual!

Speaker 10
Oh, I

Speaker 9
see.

Speaker 10
Asuka? I think that Toji might be interested in Rei. Are you kidding? Toji and Wonder Girl? Well, lunch, they

Speaker 9
seem... Don't worry, Hikari. It'll never happen. If Shinji is denser than lead, then Rei Ayanami is off the atomic scale. Really? Yep.

Speaker 12
Hmm. Can I ask you something? Okay. Just what do you see in a dumb jock like that? Is

Speaker 10
the... passionate side. What?

It was a mistake to get back with you. How can you say that now?

There are a lot of pit holes in life,

but you just have to dig your way out.

Speaker 9
You know, Asuka... Kashi sure spends a lot of time in the tub.

Speaker 4
I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 3.

Speaker 9
What? You mean you haven't heard?

Speaker 4
Who is it? Yes.

The only reason I came back to you so we could break up again.

Speaker 9
I don't know.

Speaker 13
Yeah, that was refreshing. Are you two fighting again? I don't believe it. Are you two always like this whenever Katsuragi's gone? It's not like

Speaker 14
that. I want to be happy, Kaji, especially since you're spending the night, but I can't. Not tonight. Not now. Not with everything.

Speaker 13
I understand. Let's go to bed. I find that's usually the best thing to do in this kind of situation.

Speaker 4
Hey, are you asleep yet, Gachi?

Speaker 13
No, not yet.

Speaker 4
Well, can you tell me what my father's like?

Speaker 13
Well, there's a surprise question. I would have thought you'd have asked about Katsuragi.

Speaker 4
It seems like you're always with my father.

Speaker 13
Commander Fuyutsuki is the one who's always with him. Have you been asking around about your father? I

Speaker 4
just haven't been around him much.

Speaker 13
So, you really don't know him.

Speaker 4
But I've learned a lot about him lately. I've learned how he feels about his work. About my

Speaker 13
mother. No, you're wrong, Shinji. You only believe that you've learned. But people really can't understand themselves, much less each other. Understanding 100% of anything is impossible. That's why we spend so much time trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. That's what makes life so interesting.

Speaker 4
So you can't understand Misato either.

Speaker 13
The kanji that we use for the word she means a woman far away, and women will always seem to be on a distant shore. The gulf that separates male and female is broader and deeper than any ocean.

Speaker 4
I just don't understand

Speaker 13
adults.

Speaker 1
T-minus 300 minutes to Unit 3 activation test.

Speaker 15
Primary power standing by.

Speaker 1
Repairs to left arm crimp log completed. Returning system in all sections of the unit. Roger. Team B, commence operation.

Speaker 15
Data link to Avangelion Unit 1 established.

Speaker 7
The system's all up and ready for full activation. Terrific. Let's get started. That was enthusiastic. You're aware that this unit will be assigned to your detachment once it's passed its tests, aren't you? Exclusive control of four Avas. If you wanted to, you could conquer the world. So, have you told Shinji yet? I'll tell him after the test.

Speaker 5
The fourth child has arrived. Squad 2, begin entry preparations immediately. Toji

Speaker 10
hasn't shown up yet, Asuka. Yeah, he may not come today. I thought we might eat together today. Do you want this?

Speaker 6
Unit 3's already arrived in Japan, hasn't it?

Speaker 4
Yeah,

Speaker 6
it got here yesterday. This sucks. Who's going to pilot it then? Told you he was absent today. Maybe it's him. I don't think so. Entry flux

Speaker 16
secure. Initiating burst connection.

Speaker 15
Transmitting pulse. Graph readout is normal.

Speaker 16
All checklists up to 1350 have been cleared.

Speaker 15
Phase 1 contact all cleared.

Speaker 7
Roger. Operation will proceed to Phase 2.

Speaker 15
Full nerve link established. Level is 10-5-5. Harmonics are reading standard. We are now approaching the absolute border.

Speaker 7
Break the nerve circuits! Abort the test! No! Mission

Speaker 3
failure! We've got high

Speaker 1
energy readings in

Speaker 14
the body! An angel!

Speaker 3
No! No!

Speaker 2
There's been an explosion in

Speaker 3
Matsushiro! Damage

Speaker 16
level unknown.

Speaker 2
Send the rescue squad in 3rd Battalion. We've gotta handle this before the self-defense force gets involved.

Speaker 17
Roger! We've got an unidentified object detected at the site. Its pattern is orange. We can't confirm that it's an angel yet. Go to first stage alert.

Speaker 18
All personnel, go to first stage alert. Prepare for surface-to-surface combat. All Avas, prepare for launch. First for maximum intercept potential. Air transportation to Matsushiro will go in 20.

Speaker 3
An accident

Speaker 4
in Matsushiro? It can't be. What happened

Speaker 9
to Misato? Contact hasn't been restored yet.

Speaker 4
What are we going to do? We need her.

Speaker 9
We're going to have to go for it ourselves. There aren't any other options left open for us, are there?

Speaker 4
But how can we find an angel without her?

Speaker 16
Commander Curry will command this operation.

Speaker 6
My father will? We're receiving an image of the target from the Nobe Mountain Station. Transpiring to the main monitor.

Speaker 17
As we suspected. Transmit the abort signal. Eject the unit's entry plug.

Speaker 18
It's not working, sir. Neither the abort or plug ejection codes are being accepted.

Speaker 17
What about the pilot? His heart's still beating and he's still breathing. But he's probably... I see. Then we must accept the loss of Evangelion Unit 3. Reclassify it as the 13th Angel.

Speaker 7
What? But, sir...

Speaker 17
Deploy our forces around the base of Mount Nobe. The target must be destroyed.

Speaker 2
Target is approaching. All units, prepare to engage.

Speaker 19
Huh? It can't be. Is that the

Speaker 4
Angel?

Speaker 17
Correct. That is your target.

Speaker 4
It may be our target, but it's also an Ava, isn't it? God damn him. How could it have been possessed? If that thing is an Ava, then there must be another pilot inside it, isn't there?

Speaker 3
You mean you still don't know that? The

Speaker 3
pilot of Unit 3-- Huh? Asuka? *Screams*

Speaker 19
*Screams* ASKUAAA! *Screams

* *Screams*

Speaker 18
AVA Unit 2, cease transmitting! The pilot's ejected. Recovery teams are moving in for retrieval. Target is moving towards Unit 0's position.

Speaker 17
Ray, stop it, but avoid close range combat. I'll send Unit 1 in to support you. Yes, sir.

Speaker 10
But the pilot is...

Speaker 18
The angel is merging itself into Unit Zero's arm! Nerve contamination spreading!

Speaker 17
Sever the left arm immediately.

Speaker 18
But the pilot's nerve connections are still active!

Speaker 17
Cut it off!

Speaker 18
Right.

Speaker 4
*Screams

Speaker 4
* There's somebody inside it, isn't there? Another kid just like me.

Speaker 19
Oh, an injury plug. I knew it. I knew there was someone in there.

Speaker 15
You don't want life support systems failing! Pilot life functions are endangered! Damn it! Cut our pilot's seek ratio down to 60%!

Speaker 17
Belay that! But Akari, if we don't, the pilot could be killed. Shinji, why aren't you fighting?

Speaker 19
I can't! There's still a person inside that thing.

Speaker 17
Irrelevant. It's an angel. Destroy our enemy.

Speaker 19
I can't. If he's alive, we've got to help him. I can't kill another human being.

Speaker 17
It's him or you.

Speaker 19
No! I'd rather die!

Speaker 17
Damn it. Shut down all of Unit 1's synchronization circuits immediately.

Speaker 18
Shut them down?

Speaker 17
Correct. Switch all control to the dummy plug system. But

Speaker 18
sir, the dummy plug isn't fully operational yet. Dr. Akagi hasn't approved its use!

Speaker 17
It's still better than the current pilot! Do it! Yes, sir.

Speaker 15
What's going on? What the hell are you doing, father? Signal reception is green.

Speaker 18
Control system

Speaker 16
switching is complete.

Speaker 15
All nerves linked to the dummy system. 32

Speaker 16
.8% of emotional elements are unclear. It can't be monitored. Sir?

Speaker 17
Irrelevant. Engage the system. Commence attack. *BANG*

Speaker 18
My god, is this what the dummy plug is for?

Gains are still increasing. I'm gonna die.

Speaker 3
Stop it! Father!

Speaker 1
Stop

Speaker 3
this goddamn

Speaker 1
thing for God's sake! Please, please, just stop it! If I can stop, dear God, if I can stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!

Speaker 3
Omega, stop! Stop!

Speaker 8
AV Unit 3. I mean, the target has gone completely silent, sir.

Speaker 10
Now what shall I cook? For Godama, Nozomi, and myself? But these all serve four. I sure hope he's hungry tomorrow.

Speaker 15
Over here, over here! There's a survivor here!

Third squad, erase... Locate the entire Highway 20.

Do it now!

Order's breakfast.

Two survivors found in each.

Speaker 3
I'm alive?

Speaker 4
Kaji?

Speaker 13
You were lucky, Katsuragi.

Speaker 4
Where's Ritsuko?

Speaker 13
Don't worry. She wasn't hurt as bad as you.

Speaker 5
Oh, good. What about Ava 3?

Speaker 13
It was destroyed. As an angel. By Unit 1.

Speaker 5
I... I never told Shinji. Shinji.

Speaker 4
Shinji? Misato, you're okay? I'm sorry.

Speaker 16
God, I'm sorry. I had to tell you something. Something important, but oh, dear God, I'm sorry.

Speaker 4
Misato, I... I killed you. I killed you. My dad forced me to. I begged him and begged him, but...

Speaker 19
Shinji,

Speaker 16
I'm sorry. Report from the entry plug recovery squad. The pilot's life signs are confirmed.

Speaker 19
He's alive!

Speaker 16
Shinji, the pilot of Unit 3 is... The fourth child is... Shinji? Shinji? Shinji? Shenji! Shenji!

Speaker 3
No!

I'm not sure
