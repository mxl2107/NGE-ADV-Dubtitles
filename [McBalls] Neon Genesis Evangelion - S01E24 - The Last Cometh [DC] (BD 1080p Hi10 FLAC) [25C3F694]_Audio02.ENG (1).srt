1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: I can only see you, but I'm smiling.

3
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,940
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to touch my heart.

4
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,040
Speaker 1: I'm still in awe of the pain.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,340
Speaker 1: But I'll see you soon.

6
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,000
Speaker 1: There is a way to see the future.

7
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,100
Speaker 1: The world is a great place.

8
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,480
Speaker 1: The world is a great place.

9
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,400
Speaker 1: If you're a hot dog,

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,100
Speaker 1: you'll be afraid of your thoughts.

11
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,080
Speaker 1: You'll be shining in the sky,

12
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,120
Speaker 1: a man, you'll be a fairy tale.

13
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:39,180
Speaker 2: Mama! Mama, they chose me! I'm an elite pilot now! I'm the best in the whole world now!

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,780
Speaker 2: I must keep this a secret, but I'll only tell you, Mama!

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,340
Speaker 2: Everybody's so nice to me now, I don't feel lonely anymore!

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,140
Speaker 2: I'm okay now, even without Papa!

17
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,640
Speaker 2: Look at me! Look at me, Mama!

18
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,620
Speaker 3: *Screams*

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,100
Speaker 3: No reason left to live.

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Speaker 3: Nobody cares about me anymore.

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,780
Speaker 3: My father, my mother, nobody cares.

22
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,980
Speaker 3: I have no reason left to live.

23
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,120
Speaker 4: Are you Oscar Langley,

24
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,900
Speaker 5: so are you.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,260
Speaker 5: Intelligence Division 2 just took the second child into protective custody.

26
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,300
Speaker 6: Right.

27
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,840
Speaker 6: It isn't like them to lose her in the first place.

28
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,720
Speaker 6: And then it takes seven days to find her.

29
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,380
Speaker 5: They must have done it on purpose.

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaker 5: They're trying to make trouble for us, aren't they, Major?

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,740
Speaker 6: Could be.

32
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,380
Speaker 6: And the fifth child arrives to replace Asuka today.

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,660
Speaker 6: This whole thing is just too convenient.

34
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,520
Speaker 7: Rei Ayanami.

35
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,540
Speaker 7: There's a feeling about her, almost as if my mother--

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
Speaker 7: Ray and my mother...

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,440
Speaker 7: What are you doing with them, father?

38
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,500
Speaker 8: Hello, Commander.

39
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,220
Speaker 8: Did you know my cat died?

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,860
Speaker 8: The cat my grandmother was taking care of?

41
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,360
Speaker 8: I hadn't seen it for a long time, but now I know that I'll never see it again.

42
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,780
Speaker 4: Why did you destroy the dummy system?

43
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,960
Speaker 8: It wasn't the dummy system that I destroyed.

44
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,640
Speaker 8: It was Ray!

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,060
Speaker 4: I'll ask you once more, why did you do it?

46
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,040
Speaker 8: I'm not happy anymore.

47
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,400
Speaker 8: Not even when you make love to me.

48
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,100
Speaker 9: Do whatever you want with me!

49
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,560
Speaker 9: It's never stopped you before!

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,340
Speaker 4: You disappoint me.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,520
Speaker 9: You had no hopes or expectations of me to start with!

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,160
Speaker 9: I was nothing!

53
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,900
Speaker 8: What can I do now?

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,220
Speaker 8: What, Mother?

55
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,960
Speaker 7: Where have you disappeared to, Asuka?

56
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,120
Speaker 7: But what can I even talk to her about?

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,180
Speaker 7: Could I talk about Ayanami with her?

58
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,300
Speaker 7: All of my friends, Toji, Kinsuke,

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Speaker 7: all of their homes have been destroyed and now they've left.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,020
Speaker 7: Friends.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,520
Speaker 7: I don't have anybody left. I could call my friend.

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,880
Speaker 7: and...

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,720
Speaker 7: nobody.

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,180
Speaker 7: I can't go see Ayanami again.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,860
Speaker 7: I don't have courage to face her.

66
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 7: I don't even know how to talk or act around her now.

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,840
Speaker 7: Asuka.

68
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,340
Speaker 7: Misato.

69
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,440
Speaker 7: Mother.

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,420
Speaker 7: What can I do?

71
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,780
Speaker 7: What can I do?

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:09,960
Speaker 7: Who?

73
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,200
Speaker 10: This song is good.

74
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:30,900
Speaker 10: Huh?

75
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,400
Speaker 10: Singing brings joy and revitalization to the human soul.

76
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,860
Speaker 10: I think that song is the highest achievement of the Lilam culture.

77
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,980
Speaker 10: Don't you agree, Shinji Ikari?

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,700
Speaker 10: How do you know my name?

79
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 10: Everyone knows your name.

80
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,040
Speaker 10: I don't mean to sound rude, but you're rather ignorant of your own position.

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,240
Speaker 7: Oh, really?

82
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,540
Speaker 10: Who are you?

83
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Speaker 10: I'm Kaoru. Kaoru Nagisa. I am like you. One of the selected children. The fifth child.

84
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,980
Speaker 7: You're the fifth child? Um, Mr. Nagisa...

85
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Speaker 7: Call me Kaoru,

86
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:04,680
Speaker 10: Mr.

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,140
Speaker 5: Ikari.

88
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Speaker 7: Mr. Ikari? Oh no, you can call me Shinji.

89
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,480
Speaker 5: The fifth child has just arrived.

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Speaker 6: Kaoru Nagisa, Kaoru of the seashore.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,940
Speaker 6: And all of his past records have been erased, just like Rei.

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,620
Speaker 5: But at least one record remains. He was born on the same day Second Impact occurred.

93
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,240
Speaker 6: The committee sent him directly to us. There must be something else.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,600
Speaker 5: The Marduk report's file on the fifth child was classified.

95
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,180
Speaker 5: So I hacked into the intelligence department's computer system.

96
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,500
Speaker 6: I can't believe you did that.

97
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,300
Speaker 5: Oh, it was worth doing.

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,520
Speaker 5: I found out where Ritsuko is.

99
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,700
Speaker 5: So what do you want to do about the fifth child's sync tests?

100
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,120
Speaker 6: I don't have any tricks up my sleeve this time.

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,100
Speaker 6: Let's see what he can do.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,500
Speaker 11: Take it down 0.3 more.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,460
Speaker 6: Yes, sir.

104
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,340
Speaker 11: Are these data readouts correct?

105
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,120
Speaker 11: All of the test systems are operating correctly, sir.

106
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,440
Speaker 9: The Magi confirmed that there are no data errors.

107
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,480
Speaker 11: It's incredible that he can synchronize with Unit 2 even before we've reconfigured the core.

108
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,920
Speaker 11: He's amazing.

109
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,160
Speaker 6: But this isn't possible, sir.

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Speaker 6: Nevertheless, it's happening.

111
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,680
Speaker 6: We must accept that fact and start an investigation into why it is so.

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,620
Speaker 10: You must be the first child, am I correct?

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,500
Speaker 10: You are Rei Ayanami.

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,560
Speaker 10: And you are the same as I am.

115
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,840
Speaker 10: How interesting that both of us have ended up in the same form as the Lilim for life on this planet.

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,520
Speaker 6: Identify yourself.

117
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,920
Speaker 11: The fifth child has made contact with Rey.

118
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,100
Speaker 11: I see.

119
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
Speaker 11: The Magi are currently analyzing the nature of the fifth and what his powers may be.

120
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Speaker 6: And we still don't know who or what he is.

121
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
Speaker 6: Who in the hell is this boy?

122
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,640
Speaker 6: Shinji hasn't come back yet either.

123
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,860
Speaker 6: I guess I'm not deserving of his trust.

124
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,880
Speaker 10: Central Dogma is now open.

125
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Speaker 10: Mays use route.

126
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,860
Speaker 10: We are the transfer.

127
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,580
Speaker 10: Hello.

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,920
Speaker 10: You weren't waiting here for me, were you?

129
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,060
Speaker 7: No.

130
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,200
Speaker 7: Well, not really waiting anyway.

131
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,600
Speaker 10: So what are you doing for the rest of the day?

132
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,680
Speaker 7: Well, usually when tests are over, I'll just take a shower and go home.

133
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,800
Speaker 7: But I don't really want to go home these days.

134
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,140
Speaker 10: The fact that you have a place where you can return, home will lead you to happiness.

135
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,099
Speaker 10: That is a good fact.

136
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,180
Speaker 10: You think so?

137
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,700
Speaker 10: I want to talk to you some more.

138
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,060
Speaker 10: May I come with you?

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,140
Speaker 10: To the shower, I mean.

140
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,720
Speaker 10: Aren't you going to the shower?

141
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,580
Speaker 7: Yeah.

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
Speaker 10: Or do you mean no?

143
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Speaker 7: No, I don't mean no.

144
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,660
Speaker 10: You are extremely afraid of any kind of initial contact, aren't you?

145
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,240
Speaker 10: Are you that afraid of other people?

146
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,720
Speaker 10: I know that by keeping others at a distance, you avoid a betrayal of your trust.

147
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,340
Speaker 10: For while you may not be hurt that way, you mustn't forget that you must endure the loneliness.

148
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,420
Speaker 10: Men cannot erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone.

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,300
Speaker 7: It's time.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,660
Speaker 10: Time to go?

151
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,440
Speaker 7: Yeah. I have to go to bed.

152
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,800
Speaker 10: With me?

153
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,340
Speaker 7: No, I think you have your own room that they gave you, I mean.

154
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,720
Speaker 10: Okay.

155
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,940
Speaker 10: You know, pain is something that man must endure in his heart.

156
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,340
Speaker 10: And since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe life is pain.

157
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,520
Speaker 10: You are delicate like glass, especially your heart.

158
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,440
Speaker 10: I am?

159
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,900
Speaker 10: Yes, and worth

160
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Speaker 7: earning my empathy.

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,760
Speaker 7: Empathy?

162
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,920
Speaker 10: I'm saying I love you.

163
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,800
Speaker 12: The Nerve organization was established to execute the wishes of Sele.

164
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,300
Speaker 12: It was intended to enact the scenario we had created.

165
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 12: However, it appears to have become dominated by a single zealous individual.

166
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,000
Speaker 1: Yes,

167
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,960
Speaker 12: it has. We must take it back into our own dominion.

168
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,920
Speaker 12: It is time.

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,340
Speaker 12: We must restore Nerve and the Ava series to their proper role.

170
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,860
Speaker 12: Ikari, you will take responsibility for betraying Sele.

171
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,060
Speaker 4: I'm afraid there's not much time left for accomplishing our goal.

172
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,100
Speaker 4: However, the Lance of Longinus, which would have impeded the realization of our plan, is now gone forever.

173
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Speaker 4: The last Angel shall soon appear, and with its destruction, our wishes may be born.

174
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
Speaker 4: Soon, Yui, please have patience.

175
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,220
Speaker 1: Why am I here?

176
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,680
Speaker 1: Why am I still alive?

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,500
Speaker 3: For what purpose?

178
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,000
Speaker 3: For whose purpose?

179
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Speaker 3: The fifth child.

180
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,200
Why?

181
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,920
Speaker 3: In what way

182
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,040
Speaker 6: are he and I alike?

183
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,840
Speaker 6: Thank God this apartment block is on the outskirts of town.

184
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,420
Speaker 6: It's a miracle that it and you survived.

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,460
Speaker 6: But I can't guarantee your safety any longer.

186
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,660
Speaker 6: So the Haraki family will be taking care of you.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,440
Speaker 6: From now

188
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,120
Speaker 13: on...

189
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,120
Speaker 6: I may not see you for a while, Pen-Pen.

190
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,740
Speaker 10: I think I should sleep on the floor.

191
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,180
Speaker 10: No,

192
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,980
Speaker 7: I'm staying at your place. I'm fine. I'll be okay on the floor.

193
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,600
Speaker 10: What did you want to say to me?

194
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,400
Speaker 10: What?

195
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,440
Speaker 10: You wanted to tell me something, didn't you?

196
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,120
Speaker 10: So much has

197
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
Speaker 7: happened since I came.

198
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,760
Speaker 7: Before this, I lived with my teacher.

199
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,840
Speaker 7: It was calm and boring in those days.

200
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,920
Speaker 7: I wasn't really doing anything.

201
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,480
Speaker 7: But I was fine with that.

202
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,600
Speaker 7: There was really nothing that I had to do.

203
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,720
Speaker 10: Did you hate dealing with people?

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,140
Speaker 7: More or less.

205
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,260
Speaker 7: But I didn't really care as much.

206
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,400
Speaker 7: However, I really hated my father.

207
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,740
Speaker 7: Why am I telling all of this to Kaoru?

208
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,340
Speaker 10: I think I may have been born just to meet you, Shinji Ikari.

209
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,440
Speaker 10: Humans cannot create from nothingness.

210
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,820
Speaker 10: Humans cannot accomplish anything without holding on to something.

211
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,480
Speaker 10: Humans are not gods.

212
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,440
Speaker 12: But there is one man who is trying to obtain the power of god.

213
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,980
Speaker 12: There is a man

214
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,360
Speaker 1: who

215
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,960
Speaker 12: is not one of us, who seeks to reopen Pandora's box.

216
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,700
Speaker 12: There is a man attempting to close the

217
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,100
Speaker 10: box before the hope at the bottom appears.

218
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,500
Speaker 10: The hope. You're saying this is the Lilim's hope?

219
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,780
Speaker 12: Hope exists in as many forms as there are people.

220
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,060
Speaker 12: For the human heart is the only place where hope exists.

221
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,680
Speaker 12: However, our hope is becoming substantiated.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,880
Speaker 12: That is Lilith, the progenitor of mankind, the false successors from the Black Moon.

223
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,060
Speaker 12: And also Adam, progenitor of the Angels, who are the true successors from the Lost White Moon.

224
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,820
Speaker 12: His salvaged soul exists only within you.

225
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,600
Speaker 12: Yet his resurrected body exists within Ikari.

226
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Speaker 12: Shinji's

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Speaker 10: father.

228
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,260
Speaker 12: So he also is the same as me.

229
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,000
Speaker 12: That is so. And that is why we entrust you with our wish.

230
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,940
Speaker 10: All of this I know. Is that not why I am here after all?

231
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,020
Speaker 10: It's no good.

232
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,980
Speaker 6: I can't read his lips from all the way up here.

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,980
Speaker 6: But going out at the crack of dawn just to talk to himself is pretty suspicious.

234
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,620
Speaker 6: He noticed me? That's impossible.

235
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,740
Speaker 10: All will be as the

236
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,480
Speaker 5: Lilum directed.

237
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,780
Speaker 6: Well, did you get the data on him?

238
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,460
Speaker 5: Yeah, this is it.

239
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,320
Speaker 5: I sort of borrowed it from Lieutenant Ibuki without asking.

240
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,080
Speaker 5: I'm

241
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,780
Speaker 6: sorry that I made you do something like that.

242
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,000
Speaker 6: What is this?

243
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:33,700
Speaker 6: Yeah,

244
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,180
Speaker 5: it's no wonder that Maya can't talk about this.

245
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,240
Speaker 5: It's not even theoretically possible.

246
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,000
Speaker 6: Yeah, it's getting more and more mysterious.

247
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
Speaker 6: How can he set his sync ratio at any level he chooses?

248
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,820
Speaker 6: I guess it's time to go Maverick again.

249
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:51,840
Speaker 6: It's you again.

250
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
Speaker 8: How surprising.

251
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,940
Speaker 6: I have a question for you.

252
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,020
Speaker 8: Our conversation is being monitored, you know.

253
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,120
Speaker 8: I don't care. The fifth child, what is he?

254
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,800
Speaker 8: He is probably the last angel.

255
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,600
Speaker 10: It is time. Let us go, Adam Stark's shadow, servant of the Lilum.

256
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,700
Speaker 14: Ava Unit 2 just activated!

257
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,800
Speaker 14: That's impossible!

258
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,780
Speaker 14: Where's Asuka?

259
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,160
Speaker 14: She's in room 303!

260
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,120
Speaker 14: I've confirmed it!

261
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,120
Speaker 14: Who the hell is piloting it?

262
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,080
Speaker 14: It's unmanned!

263
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,540
Speaker 14: The entry plug hasn't even been

264
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,860
Speaker 9: inserted into Unit 2!

265
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:30,100
Speaker 6: Unmanned?

266
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,820
Speaker 14: Then the fifth child isn't there?

267
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,600
Speaker 14: AT field detected in Central Dogma!

268
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,620
Speaker 14: Ava 2?

269
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,040
Speaker 14: No, the blood pattern is blue!

270
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,440
Speaker 14: It's definitely an angel!

271
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,280
Speaker 14: It's an angel?

272
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,780
Speaker 14: No! That means that Ritz goes.

273
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,640
Speaker 14: The target has passed through the fourth defensive layer and is still descending.

274
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,600
Speaker 14: It's no good! We can't cut the power to the linear carriage!

275
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,480
Speaker 11: Evacuate the area! Seal all shatters and bulkheads surrounding Central Dogma.

276
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,160
Speaker 11: We've got to buy ourselves some more time.

277
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,040
Speaker 15: Closing all bulkheads

278
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,400
Speaker 4: immediately! All personnel

279
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,380
Speaker 5: and athletes! All personnel and athletes!

280
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,320
Speaker 5: God have mercy. Saleh has sent an angel to us.

281
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:07,620
Speaker 5: The

282
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,180
Speaker 4: old man wants to advance his schedule using us as his tools.

283
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,560
Speaker 12: Humans forget their foolishness and repeat their mistakes.

284
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,840
Speaker 12: If humans do not redeem themselves willingly, they will not change.

285
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Speaker 12: We must not rely on Adam or the angels.

286
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,180
Speaker 13: We have no

287
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,800
Speaker 12: choice but to make changes with our own hands.

288
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,860
Speaker 12: I pray that Unit 1 will accomplish its task.

289
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,080
Speaker 14: Unit 2 has penetrated the armored shutters!

290
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,420
Speaker 14: Target has penetrated the second barrier, sir!

291
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
Speaker 4: Send unit one in to pursue it.

292
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,420
Speaker 14: Yes, sir.

293
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,940
Speaker 4: Under all circumstances, the last angel must be kept from entering Terminal Dogma.

294
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,020
Speaker 6: But why did the angel take unit two?

295
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,580
Speaker 4: You don't think it's going to attempt to fuse with unit two, do you?

296
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,000
Speaker 4: Or will it try to bring about our total destruction?

297
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,920
Speaker 6: No! No! No!

298
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,480
Speaker 9: It's not possible!

299
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 9: I won't believe that

300
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,760
Speaker 10: Kauru's an angel! It's a lie!

301
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,579
Speaker 6: It's a fact, Shinji. You must accept it.

302
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,540
Speaker 6: Prepare for combat, do you understand?

303
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,040
Speaker 10: Shinji, you are late.

304
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,480
Speaker 14: Any Unit 1 descending via access route 2.

305
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,199
Speaker 14: It's about to make contact with the target.

306
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,220
Speaker 14: You betrayed me! You betrayed the trust I placed in you!

307
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,480
Speaker 15: You betrayed me just like my father did!

308
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,939
Speaker 15: Unit 1 has reached the fourth layer. It's about to confront the target.

309
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:25,300
Speaker 15: There he is!

310
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,580
Speaker 10: I've been waiting for you, Shinji.

311
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,520
Speaker 15: GAURU!

312
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,460
Speaker 10: Asuka,

313
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,480
Speaker 7: I'm sorry.

314
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,600
Speaker 10: The Ava series was born from Adam, born from man's antithesis.

315
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,480
Speaker 10: And yet the Lilum will utilize that which they hate most in order to survive.

316
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,280
Speaker 10: I do not understand.

317
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,800
Speaker 15: Skaru, stop! Why is this happening?

318
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,380
Speaker 10: Your Avas and I are composed of the same matter, born from Adam.

319
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,300
Speaker 10: I can synchronize with it easily as long as there is no dominant soul.

320
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,600
Speaker 10: Unit 2's soul is now hiding itself. Thus, Ava 2 is mine.

321
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,400
Speaker 10: No!

322
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,600
Speaker 7: You've got your own AT field?

323
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,620
Speaker 10: Yes. At least that is what Yulilam called this thing.

324
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,500
Speaker 10: This is the light of my soul. A sacred territory in which no one may intrude.

325
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,260
Speaker 10: Aren't Yulilam even aware that your AT field is merely that wall that encloses every mind that exists?

326
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,360
Speaker 15: I don't understand what you're talking about!

327
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,900
Speaker 15: Both

328
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,060
Speaker 10: Avas have penetrated all

329
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,480
Speaker 6: the way down

330
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,420
Speaker 14: to the final layer!

331
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,500
Speaker 14: 20 seconds until

332
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,520
Speaker 6: the target reaches track.

333
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,540
Speaker 6: If Unit 1's signals cut off or disappears, or if any other change should occur for the worse.

334
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,380
Speaker 5: I know. I'll initiate the self-destruct for this entire facility.

335
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,040
Speaker 5: It's better than letting third impact take place.

336
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,360
Speaker 6: I'm sorry.

337
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Speaker 5: It's all right. Dying beside you wouldn't be a bad way to go out.

338
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,740
Speaker 6: Thank you.

339
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,380
Speaker 10: This is mankind's fate.

340
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,880
Speaker 10: The thread of human hope is spun with the flecks of sorrow.

341
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,260
Speaker 14: What the hell is that?

342
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,560
Speaker 14: It's

343
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,060
Speaker 13: another AT

344
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,920
Speaker 14: field, the strongest we've ever detected!

345
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,800
Speaker 14: It's shutting

346
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,300
Speaker 13: out everything!

347
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,760
Speaker 14: Light, magnetism, subatomic particles!

348
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,020
Speaker 9: It's blocking everything out? I can't sense anything!

349
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,700
Speaker 9: The targets, Unit 2, Unit 1, they're all gone!

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,560
Speaker 9: We've lost communication with the pilot!

351
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,420
*Bang*

352
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,840
Speaker 5: They've reached it. Heaven's door is opening.

353
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,240
Speaker 6: Then the angel has finally reached its goal.

354
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,240
Speaker 6: Get ready.

355
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:57,700
Enough!

356
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker 15: What's that?

357
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,120
Speaker 15: What's going on?

358
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,360
Speaker 15: It's another AT field.

359
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,740
Speaker 15: A field as strong as the first one has appeared around Terminal Dogma.

360
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,220
Speaker 15: He's right! It's breaking through the other AT field!

361
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,080
Speaker 15: What is it? Another angel?

362
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,540
Speaker 15: I don't know. I can't confirm it.

363
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,140
Speaker 15: God! It just disappeared!

364
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,540
Speaker 15: Disappeared? The angel?

365
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
Speaker 10: Adam, that from which we came.

366
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,100
Speaker 10: Must one who was born from Adam return to Adam, even though it would destroy man?

367
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,720
Speaker 10: But wait, this isn't... Lilith?

368
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,520
Speaker 10: I see. I understand now. The Lilum! Lilith!

369
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,400
Speaker 10: I thank you, friend Shinji. I wanted you to stop Unit 2 and take her from me. Otherwise,

370
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,980
Speaker 10: with her, I might have survived much longer.

371
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,820
Speaker 7: Karu, but why?

372
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,240
Speaker 10: It is my destiny to live forever, though my survival will bring destruction to the human

373
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,620
Speaker 10: race. However, it is possible for me to be killed, and whether I live or die makes no

374
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,960
Speaker 10: great difference. In truth, death may be the only absolute freedom there is.

375
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,740
Speaker 7: What are you? Garu? I don't understand what you are talking about, Garu!

376
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:33,240
Speaker 10: This is my wish. Please, destroy me. Otherwise, you will be destroyed. Only one life form

377
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,300
Speaker 10: Everyone can be chosen to evade the destruction and seize the future.

378
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,120
Speaker 10: And you are not the existence which should die.

379
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,360
Speaker 10: You need the future. It's what you live for.

380
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,160
Speaker 10: Thank you, Shinji. My life was meaningful because of you.

381
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,060
Amen, amen.

382
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,160
Speaker 7: The End

383
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,420
Speaker 7: I've never felt such kindness before.

384
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,280
Speaker 7: He was like me.

385
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,960
Speaker 7: And he was like Ayanami.

386
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,180
Speaker 7: I liked him too.

387
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,780
Speaker 7: Kauru should have survived.

388
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,660
Speaker 7: He was much better than I am.

389
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,680
Speaker 7: Kauru should have survived, not me.

390
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,780
Speaker 7: He deserved to live.

391
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:55,700
Speaker 6: No!

392
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,060
Speaker 6: The one who deserves to survive is the one who has the will to make it happen.

393
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,520
Speaker 6: He wished for death.

394
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,400
Speaker 6: He ignored his will to survive and chose to die for a false hope.

395
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,820
Speaker 6: Your survival is not a mistake, Shinji.

396
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,820
Speaker 7: Misato, how can you be so cruel?

397
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:13,880
Speaker 7: Oh.

398
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,820
Speaker 16: The Last Angel is gone, but Shinji's heart is filled with torment.

399
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:59,100
Speaker 16: Misato and Asuka find their souls laid bare seeking the help of others as they search for salvation.

400
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,500
Speaker 16: Acceptance becomes a means to an end in the next episode, the Ending World.

401
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:07,540
Speaker 16: world.
