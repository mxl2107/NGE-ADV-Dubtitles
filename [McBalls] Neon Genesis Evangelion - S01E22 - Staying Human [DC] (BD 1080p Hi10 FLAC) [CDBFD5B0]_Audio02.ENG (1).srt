1
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:07,440
Speaker 1: I guess we'll be in Japan by this time tomorrow.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,380
Speaker 1: Misato said she'd pick me up by lunch.

3
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:15,200
Speaker 1: Oh, Misato's the person who was in Germany before Yukaji.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,380
Speaker 1: I don't like her much, though.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,500
Speaker 1: She's just so affected in the way she lives.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,940
Speaker 1: So, I guess this'll be goodbye for a while.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,280
Speaker 1: That's so boring.

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:31,200
Speaker 2: Oh,

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,980
Speaker 3: I'm sure you'll make lots of new boyfriends once you get to Japan, Asuka.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,620
Speaker 3: And let's not forget that the third child is a boy, too.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,580
Speaker 1: I'm not interested in children.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,300
Speaker 1: You're the only one I love, Kashi.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,660
Speaker 3: Well, that's quite an honor.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,720
Speaker 1: I mean it, Kashi! If it's with you, then all of that stuff is totally okay!

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,980
Speaker 1: Kissing, and what's after that, even?

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,660
Speaker 3: Asuka, you're still a child.

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,980
Speaker 3: Those things can wait until you've grown up a little.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,960
Speaker 1: Huh? But why?

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,140
Speaker 1: Can't you see that I've already grown enough?

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
Speaker 1: I am a grown up!

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,560
Speaker 1: Just look at me, Tony! Please, please!

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,900
Speaker 4: So the fiction has become the reality.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,760
Speaker 4: How ironic that the experiment's advocate should become its victim.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,140
Speaker 4: So, you believe that the contact experiment was the

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,900
Speaker 5: direct cause?

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,280
Speaker 5: You mean was the mental breakdown the result of the contact?

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,220
Speaker 5: Yes. Killing herself and leaving such a young girl behind is so awful.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,220
Speaker 5: Perhaps, but I believe there may have been some additional causes.

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,440
Speaker 4: Asuka, darling, Mama cooked your favorite for you.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,740
Speaker 4: Oh no, you mustn't complain about what you like and dislike,

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,980
Speaker 4: For that girl over there will laugh at you.

32
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,760
Speaker 4: She just sits there

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,100
Speaker 1: every day, talking to that doll as if it were her real daughter.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,700
Speaker 6: I think it's because of the guilt she must feel.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,660
Speaker 6: She devoted her entire life to her research, not to taking care of her own daughter.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,940
Speaker 1: Oh, I feel your grief.

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,600
Speaker 6: It's like looking at porcelain figures of a mother and her child.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,840
Speaker 6: Perhaps there really isn't much difference between humans and dolls.

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,380
Speaker 4: Mankind creates dolls in our own image.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,860
Speaker 4: If God exists, perhaps we're all just a bunch of dolls to him.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,160
Speaker 6: Hearing you say something like that makes it hard for me to believe that you're a modern physician.

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,480
Speaker 4: I may be a doctor, but I'm a human being.

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,940
Speaker 4: And a woman first.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,660
Speaker 1: You're a strong girl, Oscar.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,420
Speaker 1: But it's alright if you have to cry.

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,080
Speaker 1: I'll never cry, Grandmother.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,520
Speaker 1: I have to take care of myself now.

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,500
Speaker 1: - Asuka,

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,760
Speaker 7: your sink ratio has dropped an entire eight points.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,320
Don't think about anything else.

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,340
Speaker 2: Just concentrate the way you used to.

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,660
Speaker 2: - I'm trying to!

53
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,560
Speaker 7: - Asuka's sink ratio is getting lower and lower.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,980
Speaker 7: - What does it mean, ma'am?

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,400
Speaker 7: - It means trouble. We don't have a spare.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,460
Speaker 7: Let's concentrate our efforts on fixing Unit Zero.

57
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,400
Speaker 7: We can't waste time on the one we might not be able to use.

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,240
Speaker 7: - Hmm.

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,100
Speaker 4: The litosis process in the left arm of Unit 2 has

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,640
Speaker 8: cleared the numerical requirement.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,900
Speaker 4: Code 3.

62
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,100
Speaker 4: Development of

63
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,320
necrosis is currently under 0.5.

64
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,460
Speaker 1: The current status of Unit 0's regeneration is stable.

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,060
Speaker 1: Connecting receptors to the secondary terminal.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,060
Speaker 4: The Avas were created from the angel known as Adam.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,340
Speaker 4: Now, in order to defeat the angels,

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,700
Speaker 4: We are employing the same forces which caused the second impact and wiped out half of the human race.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,060
Speaker 4: Only humans could be so foolish as to attempt to harness the engine of our own destruction.

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,200
Speaker 4: I hate the Avas. Is our revenge worth this?

71
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,860
Speaker 4: Major

72
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,620
Speaker 3: Katsuragi!

73
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,220
Speaker 4: They've started construction on all the Avas through Unit 13?

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,320
Speaker 4: At seven different locations around the world?

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,600
Speaker 9: Yeah. This information came from Shanghai. It's reliable.

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,079
Speaker 4: So why are they speeding up the construction process now?

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,880
Speaker 9: Well, we've lost two Avas and two more are severely damaged.

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,380
Speaker 9: I'd assume they're trying to create a reserve force.

79
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,740
Speaker 4: Perhaps.

80
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,140
Speaker 4: But we've been receiving spare parts from Germany that were originally intended for AVA Units 5 and 6.

81
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,520
Speaker 4: They've been spending an awful lot of money

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:32,860
Speaker 9: lately.

83
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,340
Speaker 9: And that's after they've doubled the existing budget.

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,700
Speaker 9: The executives are being driven by something.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,620
Speaker 4: Yeah. I can almost feel the committee's impatience behind this.

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 9: - Hmm, do you think they're doing this in anticipation

87
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,260
Speaker 9: of having to intercept multiple angels at once?

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,260
Speaker 4: - Huh, except that there's no reason for them

89
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,200
Speaker 4: to be doing that outside of the official channels.

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,720
Speaker 4: There's got to be some other reason for this.

91
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
Speaker 7: - I'm sorry, the telephone number you just dialed

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,800
Speaker 7: is currently not in use.

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,140
Speaker 7: Please try again.

94
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,460
Speaker 1: - That's weird, I still can't get through.

95
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,480
Speaker 1: I wonder if he went somewhere again.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Speaker 1: *BEEP*

97
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,460
Our train will presently be arriving in Terminal 2.

98
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,980
Speaker 1: For your safety, please wait behind

99
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,160
the white line until the train has come to a complete stop.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,180
Speaker 1: That idiot Shinji's Eva just swallowed him for a whole month.

101
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,680
Speaker 1: And now, he's acting like nothing ever happened.

102
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,600
Speaker 1: Okay, so I lost this time.

103
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,560
Speaker 1: That doesn't change the fact that you're a little...

104
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,920
Speaker 1: I'll smoke!

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,380
Speaker 4: This is the first time we've gotten together in a while.

106
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,420
Speaker 4: Why is there such an air of gloom?

107
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,720
Speaker 4: I'm finished now.

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,600
Speaker 4: Asuka?

109
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,840
Speaker 1: Why should I get it? It's probably just Kashi calling for you.

110
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,280
Speaker 1: You should answer your own phone.

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
Speaker 1: That's not likely.

112
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,440
Speaker 7: Oh, fine.

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,700
Speaker 1: Ah, the invincible Shinji stoops to answering the phone.

114
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,920
Speaker 1: He doesn't just save the world.

115
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,360
Speaker 1: Damn him! I hate the way he ignores me.

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,500
Speaker 1: It's a call for you from Germany, Asuka.

117
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,920
Speaker 1: I think it's your mother.

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
Speaker 1: A call for me? My mother?

119
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,020
Speaker 1: Give me that!

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,700
Speaker 1: Hello?

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,360
Speaker 10: Hello,

122
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,880
Speaker 1: Moody!

123
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:47,680
Speaker 10: Aha!

124
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,320
Speaker 1: When she speaks in a language I can't understand,

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Speaker 1: Asuka seems to be a different

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,220
Speaker 10: person.

127
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,360
Speaker 10: Ja, ja. Ich bin mit die Jungen sehr populär.

128
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,180
Speaker 10: Ach ja, niemals!

129
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,660
Speaker 10: Er ist ein selber Mensch.

130
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,400
Speaker 10: Ja?

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,520
Speaker 10: Yeah?

132
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:05,860
Speaker 10: Yeah?

133
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,460
Speaker 10: Asuka's mother.

134
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,720
Speaker 10: Really?

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
Speaker 10: Ah, so.

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,960
Speaker 10: Das ist aber toll.

137
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,280
Speaker 10: Ich werde jetzt in Bett gehen.

138
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,340
Speaker 10: Auf Wiederhauen.

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,660
Speaker 10: Gute Nacht.

140
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,440
Speaker 1: Wow, you two were on the phone quite a while.

141
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,900
Speaker 1: Well, it was just a routine communication.

142
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,260
Speaker 1: I wish I talked to my family.

143
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,580
Speaker 1: It's totally overrated, and it's all just for show.

144
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
Speaker 1: She's not my real mother anyway.

145
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,220
Speaker 1: Oh?

146
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,420
Speaker 1: It's not my real mother anyway.

147
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,760
Speaker 1: I don't feel like I hate her or anything.

148
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,820
Speaker 1: I just feel like...

149
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Speaker 1: And why in the hell am I telling all of this to you?!

150
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,080
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

151
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,180
Speaker 1: Ha! I've really hit rock bottom

152
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaker 1: when I get sympathy from a loser like you!

153
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,640
Speaker 1: It just makes me sick.

154
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,120
Speaker 1: There's no way I'm bathing in water

155
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,500
Speaker 1: that Misato and stupid Shinji have used.

156
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,760
Speaker 1: I won't use a washer that Misato and Shinji the dork have used for washing underwear.

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,860
Speaker 1: And I don't want to have to sit on a toilet that's been used, not by the two of them.

158
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,520
Speaker 1: I don't even want to breathe the same air they do, not the two of them.

159
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,560
Speaker 1: I hate Misato, and I hate Shinji, and I hate that first child,

160
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,140
Speaker 8: bitch,

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,460
Speaker 1: Rei!

162
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,740
I hate my dad! I hate my mom! But mostly, most of all, I hate my...

163
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,940
I hate him! I can't do it anymore! Why do I have to do this? Why me?

164
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,240
Speaker 4: Synchrograph, minus 12.8. It's barely over the starting indicator.

165
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,680
Speaker 4: That's pathetic. That's an even worse score than yesterday.

166
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,900
Speaker 4: Asuka's not feeling well

167
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,600
Speaker 7: today. It's her period.

168
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,560
Speaker 7: Sync ratios aren't influenced by physical changes.

169
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,840
Speaker 7: The problem's deeper, in her subconscious.

170
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,300
Speaker 7: It looks like we may have to replace Unit 2's pilot.

171
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,580
Speaker 7: Asuka?

172
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,960
Speaker 7: You're finished now.

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,080
Speaker 7: You know,

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,300
Speaker 4: Asuka's pride has been badly damaged.

175
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,360
Speaker 4: It's hard to blame her after she was defeated so badly.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,640
Speaker 4: But what's worse is that she feels like she was beaten by Shinji.

177
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,360
Speaker 4: Maybe it's time the three of us stopped living together.

178
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,440
Speaker 4: So you've hit your limit?

179
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,820
Speaker 4: Your nice synthetic family is falling apart?

180
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,720
Speaker 4: I don't have to take that from someone who tries to fill the holes in her own empty life with a bunch of cats.

181
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,580
Speaker 4: Hmph.

182
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Speaker 4: I'm sorry. I'm just upset.

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,420
Speaker 1: Why do I have to suffer through this just because I'm a girl?

184
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,000
Speaker 1: It's not like I want to have children anyway!

185
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,520
Speaker 1: The Route 7 loop is currently closed due to an accident.

186
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,080
Speaker 1: Please close Route 12 at the gate door.

187
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,660
*Clap*

188
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,580
*throwing*

189
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,820
*Sigh*

190
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,740
Speaker 1: This is my fault? I'm blocking myself?

191
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,620
Speaker 1: - Yes, Ava has its own mind.

192
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,080
Speaker 1: - It's just a big toy.

193
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,060
Speaker 1: - Then you don't know?

194
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,140
Speaker 1: - Now I know something's up

195
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,020
Speaker 1: when Wonder Girl starts talking to me.

196
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,840
Speaker 1: What's up?

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,360
Speaker 1: Are you happy that I'm having trouble with my Ava now?

198
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,240
Speaker 1: Well, don't worry, 'cause when the next angel comes,

199
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,980
Speaker 1: our invincible Shinji will ride out and destroy it!

200
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,160
Speaker 1: We little girls want how to fight anymore!

201
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,820
Speaker 1: They only need that pathetic Shinji!

202
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,480
Speaker 1: I thought it was bad when Shinji was nice,

203
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,200
Speaker 1: but when an emotionless, wind-up doll like you starts being sympathetic, I'm doomed!

204
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,680
Speaker 1: I am not a doll.

205
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,960
Speaker 1: You are! You'd do anything you're ordered to, don't you?

206
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,940
Speaker 1: You'd kill yourself if your commander told you to, wouldn't you?

207
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,380
Speaker 1: Of course.

208
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,980
Speaker 1: Then you are a robot, just like I thought!

209
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,720
Speaker 1: You're an unthinking, emotionless pup, and I hate you!

210
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,120
Speaker 1: I hate you! I hate everyone!

211
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,100
Speaker 1: Oh!

212
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,080
Speaker 11: Man, it looks like Shinji didn't show up again today.

213
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,360
Speaker 11: Rei misses class all the time, but...

214
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,560
Speaker 2: Asuka's gone too, and Suzuhara's still in the hospital.

215
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
Speaker 11: The situation must be really bad. They're all gone.

216
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,840
Speaker 7: The connection and fusion of VAs are within normal limits.

217
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,020
Speaker 7: The field of proliferation is within the expected range.

218
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,580
Speaker 1: So, after losing like that, you're finally fixed, are you?

219
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,060
Speaker 1: You're my doll, and you're supposed to do whatever I tell you to

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,840
Speaker 1: without arguing, do you understand?

221
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,280
Speaker 1: And why does a weapon need a mind anyway?

222
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,920
Speaker 1: It just causes more trouble.

223
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, you've got to obey all of my orders, do you hear?

224
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,880
Speaker 1: This is stupid.

225
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,300
All personnel go to first stage alert.

226
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,860
Speaker 3: Prepare for Angel Assault.

227
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,680
Speaker 1: An Angel? Another one?

228
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,780
Speaker 3: We have visual confirmation on the Angel.

229
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,240
Speaker 3: Maximum magnification.

230
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,500
Speaker 3: Its orbit is just outside our defense envelope.

231
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,980
Speaker 3: And it's maintaining a constant distance from us.

232
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,340
Speaker 4: So does that mean it's looking for a nice comfy place to land?

233
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,340
Speaker 4: Or that it's going to destroy us from way up there?

234
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,940
Speaker 3: We can't attack it from this

235
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,380
Speaker 9: distance.

236
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,000
Speaker 4: Yeah, and unless it decides to come into our range, there's not much we can do offensively.

237
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,380
Speaker 4: The Avas weren't designed to combat an enemy that's still in orbit.

238
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,560
Speaker 4: How's Ray?

239
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,180
Speaker 4: Ray and Unit Zero are both ready and waiting.

240
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,840
Speaker 4: Understood.

241
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,160
Speaker 4: Roll out unit zero. Equip it for long-range firing.

242
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,180
Speaker 1: Oscar, be ready to back her up in unit two.

243
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,660
Speaker 1: You want me to back up unit zero?

244
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,700
Speaker 1: That's right. Take the rear guard position.

245
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,160
Speaker 1: You can't be serious.

246
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,420
Speaker 1: Ava, unit two, launch now!

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,440
Speaker 1: Oscar!

248
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,340
Speaker 7: It's okay. Let her take the point if that's what she wants.

249
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,060
Speaker 7: Are you sure,

250
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,460
Speaker 3: Major?

251
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,300
Speaker 7: If she screws this up, that bitch won't be piloting anymore.

252
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,060
Speaker 7: You mean this is her last chance?

253
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,700
Speaker 7: Start preparing her replacement just to be safe.

254
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,460
Speaker 7: Right.

255
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,800
Speaker 3: Excuse me, aren't we gonna use Unit 1?

256
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,340
Speaker 4: Unit 1 stays in cryostasis.

257
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,320
Speaker 4: Those are Commander Ikari's orders.

258
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,780
Speaker 4: And after what's happened, we better accept that.

259
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,820
Speaker 1: If I fail this time, they won't let me pilot anymore.

260
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,920
Speaker 1: You can do it, Oscar.

261
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,740
Speaker 1: You must.

262
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,820
Speaker 1: The target is still out of range.

263
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,500
Speaker 1: Damn! Why are you so slow? Come and fight, Angel!

264
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,580
Speaker 3: The enemy has a particle beam weapon?

265
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,680
Speaker 3: No! No thermal emissions detected!

266
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,800
Speaker 3: Abnormal reading on Asuka's psychograph.

267
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,560
Speaker 12: Mental contamination imminent.

268
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,140
Speaker 12: An eco-border attack?

269
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,920
Speaker 12: The angels understand our psychology that well.

270
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
Speaker 3: Pulsatron beam disengaged.

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,680
Speaker 3: It's not working.

272
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 3: It's too far out.

273
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Speaker 3: No more!

274
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,700
Speaker 3: - No!

275
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,520
Speaker 3: - Damn, her rifle is out of ammunition.

276
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
Speaker 3: - What's that thing made of?

277
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,260
Speaker 3: - It's some kind of energy oscillation

278
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Speaker 3: using visible wavelengths.

279
00:15:59,840 --> 00:15:59,980
Speaker 3: It's

280
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,340
Speaker 12: similar to an AT field.

281
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,060
Speaker 12: - How's Asuka?

282
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,780
Speaker 12: - The mental contamination is crossing

283
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,000
Speaker 12: her ego borderline.

284
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,260
Speaker 12: - No!

285
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,100
Speaker 12: Don't come into me,

286
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,880
Speaker 8: don't!

287
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,440
*Screams*

288
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,700
Speaker 2: Get out of my mind!

289
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,640
Speaker 2: Please, get out of my mind!

290
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,920
Speaker 7: - Asuka! - Let the breath critical!

291
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,980
Speaker 7: We've got to get Asuka out of there immediately.

292
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,580
Speaker 7: Her mind is going to be permanently damaged.

293
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,540
Speaker 2: - Asuka, retreat! - No!

294
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,300
Speaker 2: That was an order, Asuka! I'm ordering you to retreat!

295
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Speaker 1: No! Never! I'd better die than admit defeat now!

296
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:04,920
Speaker 1: Asuka!

297
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,500
Accelerator synchronization initiated.

298
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,160
Speaker 3: Voltage is increasing. Approaching pressure zone.

299
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,420
Speaker 1: Compulsory focus

300
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,620
convergence activated.

301
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,560
Speaker 3: Compensation

302
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,560
for the Earth's rotation and gravity 0.03.

303
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,680
Pressure in the chamber is at maximum.

304
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,520
Release the final safety locks.

305
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,520
All personnel, prepare for firing.

306
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,439
Speaker 3: It's no good.

307
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,260
Speaker 3: There wasn't enough energy to penetrate

308
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,120
Speaker 12: its AT field.

309
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,500
Speaker 12: It's too far for our weapons.

310
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,360
Speaker 12: But we're at maximum power output.

311
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,940
Speaker 12: We can't get any more power.

312
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,900
Speaker 12: Unit 2's cycle graph is getting weaker.

313
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,980
Speaker 12: What's the status on the LCL mind barriers?

314
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,680
Speaker 12: Negative.

315
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,620
Speaker 12: If we can't even hope for a buffering effect!

316
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,140
Speaker 12: Switch to life support only.

317
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,760
Speaker 12: Don't let it feed back into her.

318
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,480
Speaker 12: I'll try.

319
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,280
Speaker 7: Somehow that ray is scanning into Asuka's mental wavelength.

320
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,820
Speaker 7: Are the angels trying to analyze what's inside a human mind?

321
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,280
Speaker 1: Why am I crying?

322
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,740
Speaker 1: I swore that I wouldn't cry.

323
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,180
Speaker 1: *Screams*

324
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,540
Speaker 1: Please don't

325
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,180
kill me!

326
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,240
No! I'm not Mama's doll! I'll think for myself and I'll live for myself!

327
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,200
Speaker 1: No! Don't make me remember that! I wanted to forget those things!

328
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,640
Speaker 1: Don't uncover them! I don't want those terrible memories anymore!

329
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,300
Speaker 1: Stop this! Please stop it now!

330
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,980
Speaker 7: Please, Asuka, die with me.

331
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,620
Speaker 1: If that's what you want, I'll tie with you, Mama.

332
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,400
Speaker 1: Just please, please don't stop being my mother!

333
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,080
Speaker 1: Mama! Mama!

334
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,240
Speaker 1: Mama?

335
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,700
Are you...?

336
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,760
Speaker 1: Huh?

337
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,200
Speaker 1: I'm Asuka, Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh?

338
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,620
Speaker 1: What are you, stupid?

339
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,020
Speaker 13: Now's my chance.

340
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,820
Speaker 1: Look at me, dammit! Look at me!

341
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,740
Speaker 13: No!

342
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,820
Speaker 1: None of this is the real me!

343
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Speaker 1: I'm Asuka, Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh?

344
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,100
Speaker 1: What are you, stupid?

345
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,680
Speaker 1: Now's

346
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,620
Speaker 13: my chance...

347
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,340
Speaker 1: LOOK AT ME DAMMITS LOOK AT ME!

348
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,300
Speaker 1: No! None of this is the real me!

349
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,780
Speaker 1: Hm? Huh?

350
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,180
Speaker 1: I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soryu! Charmed, huh?

351
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,580
Speaker 1: What are you, stupid?

352
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,060
Speaker 1: Now's my chance...

353
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,600
Speaker 1: LOOK AT ME

354
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,780
Speaker 2: DAMMITS LOOK AT ME!

355
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,780
Speaker 1: No! None of this is the real me!

356
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Speaker 1: Hm? Huh?

357
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,700
Speaker 1: I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soryu! Charmed, huh?

358
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,940
Speaker 1: What are you, stupid?

359
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,500
Speaker 13: Now's my chance...

360
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,200
Speaker 1: Look at me, dammit! Look at me!

361
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,100
Speaker 1: No! None of this is the real me!

362
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,600
Speaker 1: Hmm? Huh?

363
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,200
Speaker 1: I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soruyu.

364
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,260
Speaker 1: Charmed, huh? What are you, stupid?

365
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,860
Speaker 13: Now's

366
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,660
Speaker 1: my chance.

367
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,140
Speaker 1: Look at

368
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,480
Speaker 2: me, dammit! Look at me!

369
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,580
Speaker 2: No!

370
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,760
None of this is the real me!

371
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,780
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,320
Oh my god, help me!

373
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,440
Why are you there, damn you!

374
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,140
You don't do anything! You won't help me! You won't even hold me!

375
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,120
Speaker 2: You're no one! No

376
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,660
one! No one!

377
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,280
Why are you again?

378
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,240
Speaker 1: I is only...

379
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,120
Speaker 1: Are you alone?

380
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,900
No!

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,420
Stay away from me!

382
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm going to live on my own!

383
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
Speaker 2: Do you love me?

384
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
Speaker 2: I won't rely on anyone!

385
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,880
Speaker 2: Do you feel you love me?

386
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,040
Speaker 2: I can't live on my own!

387
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,800
Speaker 1: But you're lying.

388
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,340
No!

389
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,780
Speaker 10: *Evil

390
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,020
Speaker 1: Scream

391
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,380
Speaker 14: Pilot's mind entering danger zone!

392
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,500
Speaker 3: Position constant! The target hasn't moved yet!

393
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,380
Speaker 3: The possibility of the target coming into Unit Zero's range is 0.02 percent!

394
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,980
Speaker 3: Could we airlift Unit

395
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,660
Speaker 4: Zero and try an airborne attack?

396
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,760
Speaker 4: No, that

397
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,500
Speaker 15: wouldn't work. If the Angel attacked, we'd be defenseless.

398
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:32,740
Speaker 15: Let

399
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:32,880
Speaker 4: me

400
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,780
Speaker 15: go out in Unit One!

401
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,520
Speaker 15: Forget it! This Angel's ability to attack the Pilot's mind is way too dangerous!

402
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,560
Speaker 5: Yes, we cannot allow Unit One to be touched by an Angel.

403
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:42,940
Speaker 5: But

404
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,160
Speaker 12: that can't happen as long as

405
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm not defeated!

406
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,800
Speaker 5: There is no guarantee of that.

407
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,900
Speaker 12: If we don't do something, Asuka will die!

408
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,180
Speaker 12: That is

409
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,200
Speaker 5: true. Rey, go to Dogma and get the lance.

410
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,980
Speaker 5: Use the lance of Loginous! You can't do that, Akari!

411
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,340
Speaker 5: There is no other way to destroy a target that remains in orbit beyond the reach of our AT fields. Proceed.

412
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,660
Speaker 4: But I thought that if Adam and Ava were to come into contact, it would cause the third impact!

413
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,920
Speaker 4: We can't take that chance, Commander! It's too dangerous!

414
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,180
Speaker 4: So that story was another lie.

415
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,560
Speaker 4: But if contact with an angel didn't cause second impact,

416
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,880
Speaker 4: then what did?

417
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,240
Speaker 4: Opening

418
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,680
Central Dogma barriers 10 through 15.

419
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,100
Speaker 7: Unit Zero has passed the 6th Malmogé Trench.

420
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,440
Speaker 7: Now opening barriers 16 through 20.

421
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,840
Speaker 4: If something like this won't cause third impact,

422
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,040
Speaker 4: then what really caused second impact?

423
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,540
Speaker 5: Ikari, it's too early to use the lance.

424
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,660
Speaker 5: The committee has already started to mass produce Avis.

425
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,620
Speaker 5: This is our chance, Fyutsuki.

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,960
Speaker 5: Our chance, but...

427
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,600
Speaker 5: We cannot make time run backwards,

428
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,220
Speaker 5: but we can spur its course forward with our own hands.

429
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,380
Speaker 5: The old man won't allow this, Ikari.

430
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,120
Speaker 5: Therefore, we must finish this before Sele has time to act.

431
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,760
Speaker 5: After all, it is not acceptable to lose Unit 2 at this time.

432
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,280
Speaker 5: But you just can't

433
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,360
Speaker 15: use the Lance of Longinus without getting Sele's approval first.

434
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,580
Speaker 15: You're asking for trouble!

435
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,860
Speaker 15: The need is the justification. There are no other factors to consider.

436
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,940
Speaker 15: The need?

437
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,600
Speaker 15: You've just been looking for a convenient excuse, haven't you?

438
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,440
Speaker 3: Pilot's EEG dropping to 0.06!

439
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,500
Speaker 3: We're past the limits of the life support system!

440
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,200
Speaker 3: Unit zero's passing through vent two.

441
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,600
Speaker 3: She'll be coming in over the surface!

442
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,020
Speaker 4: So that's the Lance of Longinus.

443
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,120
Speaker 4: Unit zero's in position

444
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,560
Speaker 3: to throw!

445
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,700
Speaker 3: Right in sighted. Error corrections have been made.

446
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,960
Speaker 3: Starting countdown.

447
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Ten seconds till zero.

448
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,340
Nine.

449
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,440
Eight.

450
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:13,280
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

451
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,720
Speaker 3: Target annihilated.

452
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,620
Speaker 3: AVA Unit 2 has been released.

453
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,700
Speaker 15: I need a status update on the Lance.

454
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,240
Speaker 3: The Lance reached escape velocity.

455
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Speaker 3: It's now moving into a lunar orbit, sir.

456
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Speaker 15: So it's almost impossible to recover now.

457
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,880
Speaker 16: Right. There are no methods available

458
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,860
Speaker 16: for recovering something of that much mass.

459
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,000
Speaker 1: Unit 2 psychograph returning to normal.

460
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:05,700
Speaker 1: Return

461
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,060
Speaker 3: the body to the second cage.

462
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,880
Speaker 1: Returning body via access path 67.

463
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,720
Speaker 4: What's Oscar's status?

464
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
Speaker 16: We've confirmed that the pilot's alive.

465
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,980
Speaker 16: Should we put her in quarantine because of the contamination?

466
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,540
Speaker 16: Yeah.

467
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,560
Speaker 1: Hey,

468
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,180
Speaker 3: Asuka?

469
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,520
Speaker 1: I'm-- I'm glad you're okay.

470
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,880
Speaker 1: Shut up!

471
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,920
Speaker 1: Who the hell is okay?

472
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,140
Speaker 1: How could it get any worse?

473
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,720
Speaker 1: That little bitch!

474
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,660
Speaker 1: That little bitch, Ray, rescued

475
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,180
Speaker 8: me!

476
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,620
Speaker 1: Don't you know that I'd rather have died?

477
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,880
Speaker 8: I hate her!

478
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,580
Speaker 8: I hate you, Gigi!

479
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,060
Speaker 1: I hate everything!

480
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,759
Speaker 4: In the next episode, AVA Unit Zero and its pilot are possessed and violated by another

481
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,840
Speaker 4: But even as Rei's mind and body are eaten away,

482
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,740
Speaker 4: she never loses sight of her inner self.

483
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,940
Speaker 4: As the angel's corrosive essence eats into her Ava's core,

484
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,100
Speaker 4: Rei chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice.

485
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,360
Speaker 4: To protect Shinji from the angel, she surrenders her own essence,

486
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,120
Speaker 4: taking with her a huge section of Tokyo 3 in a wave of heat and light,

487
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,520
Speaker 4: and leaving behind only memories in people's souls.

488
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,240
Speaker 4: It all happens in tears.

489
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:11,980
you
