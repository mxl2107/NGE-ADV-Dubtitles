1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,080
Speaker 1: Like a cruel, cruel,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,520
Speaker 1: You are a young man,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,700
Speaker 1: You are a fairy tale,

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,160
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,580
Speaker 1: If you're in the

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,700
Speaker 1: The back of the back of

7
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,300
Speaker 1: So,

8
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,000
Speaker 2: I owe you once again.

9
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,280
Speaker 2: You're not going to pay me back anyway, are you?

10
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,400
Speaker 2: Speaking of which, regarding the materials that they demanded under the Freedom of Information Act,

11
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,340
Speaker 2: I handled it by giving them some falsified data.

12
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Speaker 2: The government is proceeding with legal action, but that will be blocked any day now.

13
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,940
Speaker 2: So should I do something about that project as well?

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,580
Speaker 3: No. Judging by the material you sent me, it appears there will be no need.

15
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,140
Speaker 2: Then I'll proceed with the plan.

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
Speaker 4: Uh, good morning.

17
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,600
Speaker 5: Good morning.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,340
Speaker 5: *crunch*

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,440
Speaker 5: *crying*

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,040
Speaker 5: That's the way to start your morning.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,080
Speaker 4: Uh, what's wrong with coffee?

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,960
Speaker 5: You got a problem with tradition?

23
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,140
Speaker 5: Don't you know that a traditional Japanese breakfast is steamed rice, miso soup and a little sake?

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,680
Speaker 4: Your tradition, maybe.

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,860
Speaker 5: 'Scuse me?

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,140
Speaker 4: And incidentally, just whose turn was it supposed to be to cook today?

27
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,620
Speaker 4: Well, now I know why a woman your age is still single.

28
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,140
Speaker 4: You're going to be an old maid, Misato.

29
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,900
Speaker 5: Are you saying that I'm lazy?

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,700
Speaker 5: And sloppy, too.

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,440
Speaker 5: Oh, just leave me alone.

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,900
Speaker 5: Oh, I'm finished.

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,200
Speaker 4: So, are you really coming to my school today?

34
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,120
Speaker 4: Of course

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,620
Speaker 5: I am.

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,460
Speaker 5: It's your parent-teacher meeting.

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,440
Speaker 4: But you're just so busy at work.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Speaker 5: Oh, it's no problem. You're part of my job anyway.

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,500
Speaker 4: So it's just part of your job, huh?

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,000
Speaker 5: Hi! Oh, thanks for coming. Yes, he's getting ready. I'll come let you in.

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,820
Speaker 4: Misato, you shouldn't go outside dressed like that. It's embarrassing.

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,940
Speaker 5: I know.

43
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,020
Speaker 6: Good morning,

44
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,400
Speaker 4: Ikari. Hey, Misato. We're taking off

45
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,820
Speaker 5: now.

46
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,780
Speaker 5: Be careful.

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,640
Speaker 4: Oh, come on.

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
Speaker 5: Hmm.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:44,820
Speaker 5: Hmm.

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,820
Speaker 5: Ironic.

51
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Speaker 5: The way he's getting more casual and expressing his feelings is a good trend.

52
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,220
Speaker 5: Yes, he's just left.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,180
Speaker 5: Make sure you keep your eyes on him.

54
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,640
Speaker 7: - Yeah! - Oh, it's really key!

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,900
Speaker 7: Ah!

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,460
Speaker 7: Ah!

57
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,579
Ah!

58
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,240
Speaker 7: Is she Ikari's guardian?

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Speaker 7: What? He's got a babe like that for a bodyguard?

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,160
Speaker 7: Those idiots.

61
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,620
Speaker 7: Oh,

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,120
Speaker 8: Misato

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
Speaker 3: is so gorgeous.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Speaker 8: Yeah, right.

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,420
Speaker 3: It's amazing someone so beautiful

66
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,060
Speaker 8: could be

67
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,140
Speaker 3: Nerve's operations director.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,220
Speaker 8: I don't think

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,520
Speaker 3: so.

70
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,180
Speaker 6: Huh?

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,900
Speaker 7: Hey,

72
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,300
Speaker 8: Kensuke,

73
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,180
Speaker 6: it's a good thing that Shinji is such a baby.

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,820
Speaker 6: Yeah, he's no rival for us.

75
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,500
Speaker 4: You guys don't know what a slob she is.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,860
Speaker 4: Man, I wish Misato were my girlfriend.

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,380
Speaker 4: Oh, no, you don't.

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,420
Speaker 1: You just don't get it,

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,780
Speaker 4: do you?

80
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,020
Speaker 1: Okay, you can handle keeping

81
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,020
Speaker 8: the Earth safe, and the two of us will take care of Misato!

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,220
Speaker 5: Unit 1 has achieved the required cooling level, shifting operations to Stage 2.

83
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:10,720
Speaker 5: Keeping the Earth

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Speaker 4: safe... That's what Eva's for.

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,220
Speaker 4: Come to think of it, just what is Eva?

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,020
Speaker 4: This entry plug smells a lot like blood.

87
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,100
Speaker 4: But I feel so comfortable and relaxed here.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,760
Speaker 4: Now that I think of it, I don't know anything about it.

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,760
Speaker 9: What's the status of Unit Zero's bio-chest components?

90
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,320
Speaker 9: It was seriously damaged, so we'll have to make an entirely new one,

91
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,720
Speaker 9: even though it's pretty close to our ancillary budget's limits.

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,800
Speaker 9: Will our job get any simpler once we get Unit Two from Germany?

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,580
Speaker 10: It could go just the other way. Disposing of those dead angels costs a bundle.

94
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,240
Speaker 5: Yeah, this place is ridiculously underfinanced,

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,860
Speaker 5: especially since mankind's future rests on us.

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Speaker 9: It can't be helped. Man cannot live by Ava alone.

97
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,480
Speaker 9: All those survivors need money to live, too.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
Speaker 9: Money, money, money.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,020
Speaker 9: So is the commander off to another conference again?

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,920
Speaker 9: Yes. He's on board and en route now.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,220
Speaker 7: Thank God for a little peace and quiet.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,340
Speaker 2: Excuse me. Do you mind if I sit here?

103
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,200
Speaker 2: Go ahead.

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,260
Speaker 2: The revised budget for the sample collection passed quite easily, didn't it?

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,820
Speaker 2: The Committee's main concern is for their own survival.

106
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,380
Speaker 2: They won't be so budget conscious when their own lives are at stake.

107
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,100
Speaker 2: Yes, they used to think there were no more angels.

108
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,160
Speaker 2: And I have more good news.

109
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,200
Speaker 2: All the permanent members of the Security Council, except the United States,

110
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,600
Speaker 2: have approved the budget for AVA Unit 6.

111
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,920
Speaker 2: It's just a matter of time before the U.S. approves it as well.

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Speaker 2: The Americans seem to be allergic to unemployment, but they'll learn.

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,580
Speaker 2: And your country?

114
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,240
Speaker 2: We will participate in the construction beginning with Unit 8.

115
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,560
Speaker 2: The plans for the second installation project are still viable.

116
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,200
Speaker 2: However, a pilot has not yet been found.

117
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,200
Speaker 2: The Angels have returned.

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,160
Speaker 2: We will have no other choice but to defeat them.

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,340
Speaker 2: My people do not want a repeat of the second impact either.

120
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,480
Speaker 2: You understand that.

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,120
Speaker 4: You mean that everything I've learned about second impact is

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,460
Speaker 9: wrong?

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,260
Speaker 9: Yes.

124
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,940
Speaker 9: The history books say that it was a disaster caused by a massive meteorite.

125
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,800
Speaker 9: But most of the true facts have been concealed through international government cover-ups.

126
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,840
Speaker 9: Fifteen years ago, in Antarctica, mankind discovered the being known as the first angel.

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,440
Speaker 9: In the middle of the investigation, however, for unknown reasons, the angel exploded.

128
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Speaker 9: That is the real truth about the second impact.

129
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,740
Speaker 4: Then the things we're doing here are...

130
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,600
Speaker 9: Are to prevent a probable third impact before it happens.

131
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,320
Speaker 9: That is the sole purpose of Nerve and the Evangelions.

132
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,280
Speaker 9: By the way, Masato, the event will occur tomorrow as scheduled.

133
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,460
Speaker 9: I understand.

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,360
Speaker 5: Good morning.

135
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,900
Speaker 5: Good morning, Misato.

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,640
Speaker 5: I'm going to old Tokyo on business.

137
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,660
Speaker 5: I'll probably be getting back late tonight,

138
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,360
Speaker 5: so have something delivered for dinner.

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,180
Speaker 5: Bye.

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,900
Speaker 4: Okay, um, sure.

141
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,620
Speaker 4: The

142
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,639
End

143
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,099
Speaker 5: It's hard to believe that this place used to be the flourishing capital known as Tokyo.

144
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,159
Speaker 5: We're here.

145
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,659
Speaker 9: Hm?

146
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,560
Speaker 9: Why are they having this in a place like this?

147
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,440
Speaker 9: Is the SSDF getting involved?

148
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,220
Speaker 9: The Strategic Self-Defense Force? No. They're not allowed to interfere.

149
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,900
Speaker 9: I see. That's why they can do whatever they like.

150
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,000
Speaker 1: Thank you.

151
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Speaker 7: Thank you.

152
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,460
Speaker 3: I'd like to thank you all for coming to this special demonstration of Japan Heavy Chemical Industrial Cooperative's latest product.

153
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,080
Speaker 3: In a few minutes, we'll be taking you up to the control room to observe the actual demonstration.

154
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
Speaker 3: But first, we'll be answering some of your questions here.

155
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:16,820
Speaker 7: Yes.

156
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,080
Speaker 7: Ah, the

157
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,400
Speaker 3: famous Dr. Ritsuko Akagi. It's our pleasure to have you here for this demonstration.

158
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Speaker 9: Thank you. May I ask you a question?

159
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,320
Speaker 3: Of course, certainly.

160
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,360
Speaker 9: The unit is equipped with an internal nuclear reactor. Is this correct?

161
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:30,840
Speaker 9: Correct.

162
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,560
Speaker 3: This is our product's most distinguished feature,

163
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,200
Speaker 9: guaranteeing 150

164
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,300
Speaker 3: days of continuous operating power.

165
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,160
Speaker 9: I see. But from a safety perspective,

166
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,000
Speaker 9: isn't it rather risky to incorporate a nuclear reactor

167
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 9: in a land-based weapon designed for hand-to-hand combat?

168
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,900
Speaker 3: We think it's more practical than a weapon that won't work for more than five minutes.

169
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,040
Speaker 9: But in an emergency, there would be problems with remote control.

170
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,700
Speaker 9: But it's more

171
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,820
Speaker 3: humane than a system that induces tremendous mental stress and causes mental instability in the pilot.

172
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,660
Speaker 9: Cut it out. You're acting like children.

173
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Speaker 9: And there's still the issue of manual control.

174
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,620
Speaker 3: I would think that it is much safer than an extremely dangerous weapon that's been known to run out of control and go berserk in the middle of a city.

175
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,460
Speaker 3: A weapon that cannot be controlled is insane. It's like an hysterical woman. Completely out of control.

176
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,720
Speaker 9: Our technology will be able to control it.

177
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Speaker 9: So

178
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,460
Speaker 3: you're saying that science and human courage will tame the savage Ava Beast?

179
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Speaker 3: Are you serious?

180
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,120
Speaker 9: Yes, of course I'm serious.

181
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,700
Speaker 9: And

182
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,920
Speaker 3: because it depends on something as fragile as a human heart,

183
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,700
Speaker 3: NERV has allowed the situation to get completely out of control.

184
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,200
Speaker 3: The UN has already had to approve an enormous supplement to your existing budget.

185
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,780
Speaker 3: And as a result, 20,000 people in a dozen countries are starving to death.

186
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,980
Speaker 3: Of course, the actual cause of all this is still under investigation.

187
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,340
Speaker 3: Why don't you at least take responsibility for your handiwork?

188
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,680
Speaker 3: How fortunate that your organization is above the law.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,240
Speaker 9: It doesn't matter what you say.

190
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Speaker 9: The fact is that Nerve has the only weapon capable of defeating the enemy.

191
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 3: You mean the AT field.

192
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,420
Speaker 3: That is simply a matter of time and research.

193
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,300
Speaker 3: Nerve's day in the sun will not last forever.

194
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,520
Speaker 5: Damn him!

195
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,520
Speaker 5: Those judges are just pissed off about being cut out of their share of the loot!

196
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,520
Speaker 5: I want to rip off that smug face of his and shove it into this locker.

197
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,920
Speaker 5: Then I'll kick it and kick it and kick it!

198
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,100
Speaker 8: Cut that

199
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,140
Speaker 9: out. Behave yourself.

200
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,280
Speaker 9: He's just a show-off, begging for praise and adulation.

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,760
Speaker 9: He's petty, not worthy of attention.

202
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,940
Speaker 9: Yeah, but how did that smug SOB know about the AT field?

203
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Speaker 9: How could something so classified leak out?

204
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,220
Speaker 9: Intelligence must be dragging its ass.

205
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Speaker 3: We are ready to begin the jet alone activation test.

206
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,860
Speaker 3: Don't worry, folks. There's no risk at all.

207
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,180
Speaker 3: Please, make yourselves comfortable and watch through the observation window.

208
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,160
Speaker 3: We are ready to begin. Start the test.

209
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
Speaker 7: Discharging the power core.

210
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
Speaker 7: Pressure levels normal.

211
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,740
Speaker 7: Cooling system circulation, normal.

212
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,960
Speaker 7: Release the control rods.

213
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,560
Speaker 7: The reactor has reached nominal power status.

214
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,940
Speaker 7: Output is normal.

215
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,680
Speaker 7: Begin walk cycle.

216
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,820
Speaker 7: Walking forward ahead, slow.

217
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,120
Speaker 7: Forward right leg.

218
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,700
Speaker 7: Roger.

219
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,680
Speaker 7: Walk forward ahead, slow.

220
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
Speaker 7: Forward right leg.

221
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,360
Speaker 11: Balance is nominal.

222
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,960
Speaker 11: Power core status, nominal.

223
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,520
Speaker 11: Roger.

224
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,780
Speaker 11: Now, forward left leg.

225
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,740
Speaker 11: Keep her steady.

226
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,360
Speaker 11: Roger.

227
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,540
Speaker 11: Forward left leg.

228
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,580
Speaker 11: Maintaining balance.

229
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,280
Speaker 5: Oh boy, it's walking.

230
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,460
Speaker 5: That's certainly something to be proud of.

231
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,240
Speaker 7: What's wrong?

232
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,100
Speaker 7: This is odd.

233
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,020
Speaker 7: The pressure inside the reactor is increasing.

234
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 7: The temperature of the primary cooling system is also rising.

235
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,140
Speaker 7: Valve open.

236
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,220
Speaker 7: Insert the neutron deceleration fluid.

237
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,920
Speaker 7: No effect.

238
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,940
Speaker 7: The pump output isn't increasing.

239
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,560
Speaker 7: Initiating valve system check.

240
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,860
Speaker 7: All right, emergency stop.

241
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,680
Speaker 7: Cut off the power.

242
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,300
Speaker 7: Aboard signal transmission confirmed.

243
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,380
Speaker 7: It's not accepting it.

244
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,020
Speaker 7: The radio circuit is being blocked! It's out of control!

245
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,540
Speaker 7: This can't be happening.

246
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,940
Speaker 7: It's coming right at us!

247
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,340
Speaker 7: Oh my god, no!

248
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,060
Speaker 5: This robot's as badly behaved as the idiot who built it!

249
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,180
Speaker 7: The compression valve is operating irregularly! The control rods aren't working!

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Speaker 7: possibility of meltdown imminent.

251
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,720
Speaker 3: Impossible.

252
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,660
Speaker 3: The jet alone's onboard computer system

253
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,440
Speaker 3: has been programmed to handle all possible contingencies

254
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,060
Speaker 3: and scenarios.

255
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,320
Speaker 3: This kind of thing simply cannot happen.

256
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,260
Speaker 5: Well, then you're about to have an impossible nuclear meltdown

257
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,740
Speaker 5: out there.

258
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,860
Speaker 3: Under the present circumstances, our only viable option

259
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,260
Speaker 3: is to wait for it to stop itself.

260
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,980
Speaker 5: And how likely is that?

261
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,660
Speaker 5: 0

262
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,520
Speaker 7: .0002%.

263
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,860
Speaker 7: It would be an act of God.

264
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,060
Speaker 5: Acts of men are better than acts of God.

265
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,540
Speaker 5: Tell me how to stop that thing.

266
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,360
Speaker 3: We've already tried every possible option.

267
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,000
Speaker 3: Not yet.

268
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Speaker 5: There's got to be a last resort.

269
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,580
Speaker 5: A way to wipe out everything. Tell me the password.

270
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:18,720
Speaker 5: The

271
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,400
Speaker 3: password to delete all programming is top secret.

272
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,420
Speaker 3: I don't have the authority to release it.

273
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,020
Speaker 3: I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to tell you.

274
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,840
Speaker 5: Then you better get the clearance, Vato.

275
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,960
Speaker 5: Do it!

276
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,040
Speaker 3: Tokita here. Let me speak to Mr. Manda in Tokyo 2.

277
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,640
Speaker 3: That's right, the Director of Internal Affairs.

278
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,400
Speaker 3: Well, I'll have to delegate that to Mr. Yasugi.

279
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,220
Speaker 3: Ask him.

280
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,260
Speaker 3: Well, I can't give you authorization for such an important matter verbally.

281
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,060
Speaker 3: Could you submit a written request?

282
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,080
Speaker 3: So now I need to get Mr. Yoshizawa's permission?

283
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,660
Speaker 3: What? Yes, I've already gotten approval from Mr. Witts. Yes, yes, okay.

284
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,880
Speaker 5: Bureaucracies.

285
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,800
Speaker 3: A written order of clearance will be sent. I'll give you the password then.

286
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,220
Speaker 5: We can't wait that long! Once Jett alone's reactor red lines, it'll be too late!

287
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,300
Speaker 5: Jet alone is heading

288
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,340
for Atsugi City.

289
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Speaker 5: Time's running out.

290
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,220
Speaker 5: I'm taking the responsibility for this operation myself.

291
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,820
Speaker 5: You can wait here.

292
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,940
Speaker 5: Yuga, I want you to roll out the transport and bring Shinji and Unit 1 with the F equipment up here right now.

293
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,240
Speaker 5: Yes, this is an emergency.

294
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,400
Speaker 9: This is pointless.

295
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,180
Speaker 9: Call this off, Captain Katsuragi.

296
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,480
Speaker 9: Do you have any idea as to how to stop it?

297
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,540
Speaker 5: I'll override the computer manually.

298
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,080
Speaker 3: - Are you serious?

299
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,880
Speaker 5: - Yes.

300
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Speaker 3: But, but Jet Alone's interior must be flooded with radiation.

301
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,480
Speaker 3: You're insane!

302
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,200
Speaker 5: But if I succeed, Atsugi will be saved!

303
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,840
Speaker 7: The access hatch can be opened manually as soon as our command signal is cut off.

304
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,700
Speaker 7: You should be able to enter the hatch through the backpack unit.

305
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:52,980
Speaker 7: Mm

306
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,020
Speaker 5: -hmm.

307
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,400
Speaker 7: That's the password

308
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
Speaker 3: to delete the programming.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,640
Speaker 5: Thank you, sir.

310
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,220
Speaker 5: Our target is jet alone.

311
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
Speaker 5: There's a danger that it may begin to melt down in five minutes.

312
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,340
Speaker 5: Therefore, we cannot allow it to get any closer to a populated area.

313
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,100
Speaker 5: Hugo!

314
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:15,940
Speaker 10: Yes, ma'am?

315
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,360
Speaker 10: As soon

316
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,000
Speaker 5: as you drop Unit 1, take the transport up to a safe altitude and stand by.

317
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,460
Speaker 10: Roger.

318
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,720
Speaker 5: And Shinji?

319
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:21,900
Speaker 5: Yes?

320
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,740
Speaker 5: Run alongside the target and place me onto its back.

321
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,540
Speaker 5: Once I've gotten on, I want you to try to hold jet alone back as much as you can.

322
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,840
Speaker 5: You're climbing on that

323
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,080
Speaker 8: thing?

324
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,160
Speaker 5: To break into it?

325
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,020
Speaker 5: That's right.

326
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,420
Speaker 5: But that's just crazy!

327
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,900
Speaker 5: I know, but I'm afraid there just isn't any better way to stop it.

328
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,040
Speaker 5: But it's too dangerous!

329
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,540
Speaker 5: Don't worry. Unit 1's armor can handle both the explosion and the radiation.

330
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,000
Speaker 8: Not for Ava! I

331
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,800
Speaker 5: meant for you!

332
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,620
Speaker 5: Well, I've got to give it my best shot, you know.

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,620
Speaker 5: My conscience won't let me do otherwise.

334
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,460
Speaker 10: Ma'am, I've sighted a target.

335
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,160
Speaker 5: Right! Here we go!

336
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,780
Speaker 10: Ava approaching drop position.

337
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:07,280
Speaker 5: Docking release!

338
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,199
Speaker 5: Roger.

339
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:28,319
Speaker 4: We've caught up with it.

340
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,680
Speaker 4: We've got less than four minutes.

341
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,800
Speaker 5: Put me on now!

342
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,080
Speaker 5: Don't think about it, do it!

343
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,360
Speaker 1: Be careful.

344
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,160
Speaker 7: Talk about

345
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 5: hot! I got a bad feeling about this.

346
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,440
Speaker 7: Stop running, you bastard!

347
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,860
Misato, hurry up!

348
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,120
Speaker 5: I found it.

349
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,600
Speaker 1: Error? What

350
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,080
Speaker 5: the hell?

351
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,020
Speaker 5: The program must have been altered. It must have.

352
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,120
Speaker 7: The power reactor is just 0.2 point short of critical.

353
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,680
Speaker 7: The control rod still won't function.

354
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,640
Speaker 5: I guess I'll try the long shot.

355
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,720
Speaker 1: Misato! Get out of there!

356
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,160
Speaker 1: Move, you move! Damn it! You can do it!

357
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,240
Speaker 1: Misato!

358
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,620
Speaker 7: 0.1 to critical!

359
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,440
Speaker 7: My god, it's going to go!

360
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,520
Speaker 7: Meltdown imminent!

361
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,820
Speaker 7: - All safety is failing! - Dear god!

362
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,680
Speaker 8: Misano!

363
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:36,760
Speaker 8: Help!

364
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,900
Speaker 7: She did

365
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,080
Speaker 9: it!

366
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,340
Speaker 9: Internal pressure lowering.

367
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,880
Speaker 7: All readings are nominal.

368
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,500
- Yes! - Yes!

369
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,900
Speaker 9: Yes, she did it!

370
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,560
Speaker 9: Crazy fool.

371
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,900
Speaker 5: Misato,

372
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,620
Speaker 4: are you all right?

373
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,760
Speaker 5: Misato!

374
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,520
Speaker 5: Yeah, I'm okay.

375
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,800
Speaker 5: Not in the greatest of shape, however.

376
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,980
Speaker 4: You're alive! Oh, God!

377
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,540
Speaker 4: Are you all right?

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,260
Speaker 4: Oh, thank God! I can't believe you did it!

379
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,660
Speaker 4: It's a miracle!

380
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,160
Speaker 5: Yeah.

381
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,200
Speaker 9: But the miracle was set up by someone.

382
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,680
Speaker 9: Recovery of Unit 1 is completed.

383
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,760
Speaker 9: No danger of radioactive contamination.

384
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,080
Speaker 9: Except for Captain Katsuragi's operation,

385
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,940
Speaker 9: everything went according to the plan.

386
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,740
Speaker 3: Good work.

387
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,180
Speaker 5: Good morning, Shinji.

388
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:00,880
Speaker 5: Yee-haw!

389
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,000
Speaker 5: *Gasp*

390
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,360
Speaker 5: That's the way to start your morning.

391
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,120
Speaker 5: Now, let me out that shower.

392
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,180
Speaker 5: Hey, Shinji, have you seen any clean bras or panties lying around?

393
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,400
Speaker 4: Good

394
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,660
Speaker 5: morning, Ikari!

395
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,100
Speaker 4: Morning.

396
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,140
Speaker 5: I'm taking off!

397
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,620
Speaker 5: Have a nice day!

398
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
Speaker 3: Misato is just so cool.

399
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,620
Speaker 4: Yeah, I used to think so too.

400
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,360
Speaker 4: But she's such a slob.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 4: She's always embarrassing me.

402
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,260
Speaker 4: She never does anything but lie around the house.

403
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,040
Speaker 4: She's not embarrassed about it, but I am.

404
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,780
Speaker 6: You're a lucky guy.

405
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,800
Speaker 6: What do you mean?

406
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,680
Speaker 6: Ikari really is just a kid, isn't he?

407
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,500
Speaker 6: He sure is.

408
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,900
Speaker 6: Meaning what?

409
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,600
Speaker 6: She let's you see a side of her that she wouldn't show to anyone else, right?

410
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,660
Speaker 6: That means she's your family.

411
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,380
Speaker 4: Yeah.

412
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,660
Speaker 1: In other words, darling, kiss

413
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,220
Speaker 8: me

414
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 1: Fill my heart with song

415
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,180
Speaker 1: And let me sing forevermore

416
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,140
Speaker 1: You are all I long for

417
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,220
Speaker 1: All I worship and adore

418
00:22:49,980 --> 00:23:00,220
Speaker 1: In other words, please be true. In other words,

419
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,260
Speaker 5: I love

420
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,000
Speaker 1: you.

421
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,360
Speaker 5: Don't miss Oscar strikes!
