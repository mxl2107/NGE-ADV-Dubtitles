1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,600
Speaker 1: The young man who is a sad thing

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:15,360
Speaker 1: You are a young man who is a fairy tale

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,020
Speaker 1: The wind is now on the

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:06,720
Speaker 1: I'll see you soon.

5
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,520
Speaker 1: I'll be shining in the sky

6
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,140
Speaker 1: I'll be a man, be a fairy tale!

7
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,320
*BANG*

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,400
*BANG*

9
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:35,440
*BANG*

10
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:37,460
*BANG*

11
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,640
Speaker 2: Shinji, did you change the soup's flavor somehow?

12
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,480
Speaker 3: Yeah, I used dried fish stock.

13
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,920
Speaker 3: Ritsuko gave it to me.

14
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,380
Speaker 2: *BANG*

15
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,080
*BANG*

16
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,340
Speaker 4: *BANG*

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,580
Speaker 4: It's too hot!

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,560
Speaker 3: I'm sorry.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Speaker 4: You're always apologizing!

20
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 4: Do you really think it's your fault?

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,420
Speaker 4: Apologies are your condition reflex to any kind of confrontation, aren't they, Shinji?

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
Speaker 4: Don't you have any spine at all?

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,720
Speaker 3: I'm sorry.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,580
Speaker 4: There you go again.

25
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,820
Speaker 4: Why do you always have to punish yourself for

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,039
Speaker 5: everything?

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,000
Speaker 5: There, there.

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,960
Speaker 4: That's just Shinji's way, you know.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,620
Speaker 4: It's so easy for you just to accept his pathetic habits, isn't it?

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,100
Speaker 4: But don't you think you've been too easy on him lately?

31
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaker 4: Have I?

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,580
Speaker 4: Maybe you and Kaji have hooked up again, but the fact that you're happy doesn't mean that you can just ignore the welfare of the rest

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:26,840
Speaker 5: of us.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Speaker 5: Look, there's nothing

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
Speaker 4: going on between me and Kaji.

36
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,300
Speaker 6: Hey, Katsuragi, I found a bar that serves a decent drink. How about tonight? Bye.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,780
Speaker 4: I've never been around anyone who's been involved in such a totally indecent relationship.

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,820
Speaker 4: And you're supposed to be our guardian? What a hypocrite! It's disgusting!

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,620
Speaker 2: Meantime harmonics test, all systems green.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,200
Speaker 6: Projected adjustment values have been cleared.

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,820
Speaker 6: You're looking pretty worn to the bone, Major Katsuragi.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,280
Speaker 2: There's reasons why

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,780
Speaker 6: I'm worn.

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,680
Speaker 2: Private ones.

45
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,620
Speaker 7: Haji's bone.

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,360
Speaker 1: Shut your face!

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,280
Speaker 2: Anyway, how's the third child doing?

48
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Speaker 2: Just take a look.

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,280
Speaker 2: Oh.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Speaker 2: Wow.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,500
Speaker 2: I bet knowing this will boost his confidence a little.

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,780
Speaker 2: Can you hear me, Shinji?

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,080
Speaker 3: Oh, hi, Misato.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,900
Speaker 2: So how are my

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,580
Speaker 3: test scores looking?

56
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,900
Speaker 3: Great, you're number one.

57
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,880
Speaker 4: Oh, it's not just that I lost.

58
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,340
Speaker 4: It's that he beat us so easily.

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,120
Speaker 4: He beat us so easily that it's really pissing me off!

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,180
Speaker 4: Oh, he's so great! He's so wonderful! He's so awesome!

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,700
Speaker 4: Shinji, he's our hero, and he used to be a zero!

62
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,440
Speaker 4: Okay, so that just makes our job a little easier, right?

63
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,000
Speaker 4: But it also means that the two of us will have to be doing double time just so that we're not left behind!

64
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,580
Speaker 8: I'm leaving.

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,640
Speaker 8: *Gasp

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:49,640
*

67
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,480
Speaker 5: *Gasp*

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,280
Speaker 5: *Gasp*

69
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,740
Speaker 2: Next stop is Seisho Kabusei.

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,380
Speaker 2: Seisho Kabusei.

71
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,540
Speaker 2: Convenient for the Bashar, used books, and video game stores.

72
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,660
Yeah.

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
*Gasp*

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,340
*Evacuation*

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,980
Speaker 2: Five minutes until the evacuation of the Western District can be completed.

76
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,080
Speaker 2: The target is advancing slowly at approximately 2.5 km per hour.

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,880
Speaker 2: You're late, Major!

78
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,320
Speaker 2: Sorry! What's going on? The Fuji observation center's--

79
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,300
Speaker 7: Never detected it. It just suddenly appeared right above us.

80
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,820
Speaker 7: The pattern is orange. No AT field detected.

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,060
Speaker 2: What is that thing? A new kind of angel?

82
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,120
Speaker 7: Unknown. The Magi are withholding their judgment on

83
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,260
Speaker 2: that.

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,940
Speaker 2: Damn! Another situation like this at Command Ikari is not here again!

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,840
Speaker 2: Can you all hear me?

86
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,400
Speaker 2: I've sent you all of the known target data.

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,640
Speaker 2: That's literally all we know right now.

88
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,400
Speaker 2: Approach it carefully and observe its reactions.

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Speaker 2: And if possible, try to lure it outside of the city.

90
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,060
Speaker 2: I want you all to back up each other.

91
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:28,860
Speaker 2: Is

92
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,320
Speaker 5: that understood?

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,380
Speaker 2: Yes

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,900
Speaker 4: ma'am!

95
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,560
Speaker 4: But don't you think that Shinji ought to be taking the point position?

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,280
Speaker 4: Huh?

97
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,040
Speaker 4: Well, it's only right that a job like this should go to the highest rated,

98
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,640
Speaker 4: bravest, number one synchro ratio holder of them all, don't you think?

99
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,540
Speaker 4: Or could it be that you don't feel up to it, Shinji?

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,180
Speaker 4: I can do it.

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,900
Speaker 4: In fact, I'll show you how

102
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
Speaker 3: it ought to be done, Asuka.

103
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,500
Speaker 3: What was that?

104
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,280
Speaker 2: Will the two of you cut it out?

105
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,300
Speaker 3: Oh, gee, didn't you tell me, Misato, that I was number one?

106
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,840
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but I...

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,980
Speaker 3: And after all, combat's a man's job.

108
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,860
Speaker 4: You're showing a piglet, but Unit 2 will back him off.

109
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,660
Speaker 4: Unit 0 will back up as well.

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Speaker 9: I don't believe these kids.

111
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,040
Speaker 9: Shinji's hormones are kicking in, aren't they?

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,780
Speaker 9: I'm gonna have to chew him out when he gets back.

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,340
Speaker 9: Of course, you're a model guardian.

114
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,520
Speaker 4: Ayanami, Asuka, are you in your positions yet?

115
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,620
Speaker 4: Not yet.

116
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,420
Speaker 4: You know it, Ava can't move that fast, you twit!

117
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,520
Shice.

118
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,840
Speaker 3: Are you there?

119
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,220
Speaker 3: Alright, I'll stop it myself

120
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,400
Speaker 7: It vanished!

121
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,580
Speaker 7: Status!

122
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,360
Speaker 7: Pattern blue! Angel confirmed! It's right beneath you and I'm what?

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,420
Speaker 7: What the? A shuttle?

124
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,220
Speaker 7: What the hell is

125
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,600
Speaker 2: this? This can't be happening!

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,160
Speaker 2: It's Shinji! Get out of there! Shinji!

127
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,360
Speaker 2: Ikari!

128
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,280
Speaker 2: You idiot gets her ass again!

129
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:26,960
Speaker 2: - Ah!

130
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,320
Speaker 2: Misato!

131
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,740
Speaker 2: What's going on?

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,440
Speaker 2: Help me!

133
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,960
Speaker 2: Misato!

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,820
Speaker 2: Misato!

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,360
Speaker 2: - He jacked that plug!

136
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,560
Speaker 2: Get him out of there!

137
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,380
Speaker 2: No response!

138
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,320
Speaker 2: It's not working!

139
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,540
Speaker 2: Misato!

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,920
Speaker 2: Misato!

141
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,160
- Sh, Enji!

142
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,680
Speaker 4: - Aska Ray!

143
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,940
Speaker 4: Rescue Unit 1, hurry!

144
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,720
Speaker 4: - What's the point in only getting A's on Tansy?

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,700
Speaker 4: Not in the real world!

146
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,540
Speaker 4: It's gone again!

147
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,920
Speaker 4: Asuka, watch the street!

148
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,520
Speaker 4: The shadow!

149
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,440
Speaker 4: Oh no!

150
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,920
Speaker 4: The whole city is sinking!

151
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,380
Speaker 4: Asuka!

152
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:21,980
Speaker 4: Ray!

153
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,560
Speaker 4: Pull back!

154
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460
Speaker 5: Wait!

155
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,860
Speaker 4: Unibun and Shinji are still in there.

156
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,800
Speaker 2: This is an order. Withdraw now.

157
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,039
Speaker 6: Major Katsuragi must feel terrible.

158
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,680
Speaker 6: They reeled Shinji's umbilical cable back in, but the other end was missing.

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,620
Speaker 3: Then,

160
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,080
Speaker 6: without power...

161
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,520
Speaker 6: There's not much energy left in the internal batteries.

162
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,780
Speaker 6: If Shinji doesn't waste it groping blindly in the dark,

163
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,500
Speaker 6: if he stays in the most minimal life support mode,

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,620
Speaker 6: then he can survive for 16 hours.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,820
Speaker 3: The second tank battalion has been deployed.

166
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,520
Speaker 3: Roger. Hold your current positions and stand by.

167
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,780
Speaker 3: Confirmed. Condition green. New line transmitting data.

168
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,480
Speaker 4: The UN forces have surrounded the shadow.

169
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,640
Speaker 4: Movement?

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,540
Speaker 4: It hasn't moved. It stopped spreading once it passed a diameter of 600 meters.

171
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,900
Speaker 4: Speaking of which, is there a reason for moving all those ground troops in there?

172
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,660
Speaker 2: They're there to help us apply pressure, theoretically.

173
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,560
Speaker 2: Taking matters into his own hands.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,280
Speaker 2: Defying

175
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,840
Speaker 4: operations.

176
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,880
Speaker 2: I guess he

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,100
Speaker 4: got what he was asking for.

178
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,540
Speaker 4: Just because he got a little better score than mine,

179
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,640
Speaker 4: why'd he have to go and try to show me how it ought to be done?

180
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,540
Speaker 4: Ein großer Dumpkopf, nicht?

181
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:40,920
Speaker 4: What?

182
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,400
Speaker 4: Oh, were my comments about Shinji pissing you off, Wonder Girl?

183
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,520
Speaker 8: I wonder, do you only pilot a Neva for the praise of others?

184
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,040
Speaker 8: What

185
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,200
Speaker 4: in the hell are you talking about?

186
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,640
Speaker 4: I don't need to have anybody's approval but my own!

187
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,000
Speaker 4: Cut it out, you two.

188
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,020
Speaker 4: Asuka's right. He acted arbitrarily and without consulting anyone.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,140
Speaker 2: So I guess I'll just have to punish him when he comes back.

190
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,340
Speaker 3: I never thought that doing nothing could be this exhausting.

191
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,100
Speaker 3: Still nothing but white noise.

192
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,280
Speaker 5: No radar

193
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,740
Speaker 3: data or sonar reflections.

194
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,000
Speaker 3: It's been 12 hours since I switched to life support mode.

195
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,580
Speaker 3: My life will end in 4 or 5 hours.

196
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,500
Speaker 3: I'm hungry.

197
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
Speaker 2: So that shadow is actually the

198
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,020
Speaker 6: angel's body?

199
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,680
Speaker 6: Correct. It's 680 meters in diameter with a thickness of 3 nanometers.

200
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,200
Speaker 6: Sustained within that ultra-thin space is an inverted AT field.

201
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,780
Speaker 6: Inside of that field is a region of space that can only be defined by abstract mathematics.

202
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,840
Speaker 6: A sea of Dirac. It could be another universe.

203
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
Speaker 6: What about the sphere?

204
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 6: It disappears when the imaginary circuit of the body closes.

205
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,700
Speaker 6: This implies that the object in the sky is a kind of shadow.

206
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,700
Speaker 6: So the black shadow that swallowed Unit 1 is the real target.

207
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,860
Speaker 6: Then there's no way we

208
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,740
Speaker 2: can fight it.

209
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,780
Speaker 3: The water is getting cloudy.

210
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,720
Speaker 3: The purification system is breaking down.

211
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,340
Speaker 3: It smells in here.

212
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,920
Speaker 3: Blood.

213
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,620
Speaker 3: This lake smells like blood.

214
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Speaker 5: No, I hate

215
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,620
Speaker 3: this place.

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Speaker 3: Let me out.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,640
Speaker 3: Why can't I open this log?

218
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,680
Speaker 3: Open up.

219
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,860
Speaker 3: Let me out.

220
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,920
Speaker 3: He's not going to tell me what's going on.

221
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,060
Speaker 3: He's not all.

222
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,160
Speaker 3: Asuka, I know he needs to go.

223
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,320
Speaker 3: Father.

224
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,340
Speaker 3: Father.

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:58,920
Speaker 3: Please.

226
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,780
Speaker 3: Someone help me.

227
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,880
Speaker 6: You're gonna blow the shadow up?

228
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,700
Speaker 6: I'm afraid it's the only possibility that might work.

229
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,720
Speaker 6: The plan is to drop all 992 existing N2 mines into the target center, while simultaneously

230
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,300
Speaker 6: activating the AT fields of both remaining Avas in such a way as to disrupt the hypothetical

231
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,440
Speaker 6: circuit that encloses the Angel's pocket interior.

232
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,700
Speaker 6: If we concentrate enough explosive power during that same microsecond, we could destroy the

233
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,100
Speaker 6: Angel along with the Darok-C that makes up its body.

234
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,040
Speaker 6: But the damage to Ava would be...

235
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,880
Speaker 6: Shinji wouldn't...

236
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,400
Speaker 6: What kind of rescue operation is this?

237
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,840
Speaker 6: Our priority is to get the Eva back,

238
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,840
Speaker 6: even if it has to be destroyed in the process.

239
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,060
Speaker 6: Now wait a second!

240
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,800
Speaker 6: Under these conditions, the pilot's life is irrelevant.

241
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,720
Speaker 7: It's your responsibility if Shinji's lost, Masato!

242
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,140
Speaker 7: You seem to have forgotten

243
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,400
Speaker 2: that!

244
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,540
Speaker 2: Then why in the hell are you and Commander Ikari

245
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 2: so worried about recovering Unit 1?

246
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,340
Speaker 2: What's so special about it?

247
00:12:59,480 --> 00:12:59,920
Speaker 2: You've been

248
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,620
Speaker 6: given all the information, Major!

249
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,780
Speaker 6: That's a bull.

250
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,120
Speaker 6: Miss Otto, just trust me.

251
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,700
Speaker 6: I'm taking command of this entire operation, effective immediately.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
Speaker 6: Forward all flights to Kansai International Airport.

253
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,520
Speaker 6: Contact air control and the air transport...

254
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,880
Speaker 6: Second

255
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,260
Speaker 2: impact?

256
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
Speaker 2: The instrumentality

257
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:26,880
Speaker 6: project,

258
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,860
Speaker 2: Adam.

259
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,940
Speaker 6: There's so many secrets that I'm in the

260
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,600
Speaker 2: dark about.

261
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,020
Speaker 3: Who's that?

262
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:43,880
Speaker 3: Who?

263
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,240
Speaker 3: Who, Shinji Ikari?

264
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,940
Speaker 3: That's me.

265
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,260
Speaker 3: I am you.

266
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,000
Speaker 3: This self incorporates another self.

267
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,700
Speaker 3: The self has always been composed of two selves.

268
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:58,860
Speaker 3: To?

269
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,660
Speaker 3: Yes, the self which is observed and the

270
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:01,900
Speaker 5: self

271
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,880
Speaker 3: which observes itself.

272
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,760
Speaker 3: To expound, there is the Shinji Ikari that exists in your mind, the Shinji Ikari in Misato

273
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,840
Speaker 3: Katsuragi's mind, the Shinji Ikari in Asuka Soryu's mind, the Shinji Ikari in Rei Ayanami's

274
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,840
Speaker 3: mind, and the Shinji Ikari in Gendo Ikari's mind.

275
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,760
Speaker 3: All are different Shinji Ikaris, but each of them is a true Shinji Ikari.

276
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,260
Speaker 3: What you fear is the Shinji Ikaris who exist in the minds of others.

277
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,360
Speaker 3: I'm just afraid of being hated.

278
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,240
Speaker 3: You are afraid of being hurt.

279
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,320
Speaker 4: Who is bad?

280
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,380
Speaker 3: Father is.

281
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,520
Speaker 3: The father who deserted us.

282
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,500
Speaker 4: No, I'm the one who's bad!

283
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,300
Speaker 4: There you go again! You're always apologizing!

284
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,740
Speaker 4: Do you really think it's your fault?!

285
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,460
Speaker 2: I'm worthless.

286
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,160
Speaker 2: No!

287
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,240
Speaker 2: You just believe that you're worthless, Shinji.

288
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 2: Don't you trust your own father?

289
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,800
Speaker 3: I thought I hated my father, but now I'm not sure.

290
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,740
Speaker 2: That was good work, Shinji.

291
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 3: My father called me by my name. I was praised by my father!

292
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,960
Speaker 3: Will you live the rest of your life regurgitating and redigesting those few pleasant memories?

293
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,740
Speaker 1: If I trust

294
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,020
Speaker 3: their words, it's enough. Enough to keep me alive.

295
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,620
Speaker 3: Even though you know you're deceiving yourself?

296
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,060
Speaker 3: Everybody does it. That's how everyone survives.

297
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,740
Speaker 3: If you will not accept that you are capable of initiating change within yourself, you will be unable to continue.

298
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,440
Speaker 3: This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on.

299
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,740
Speaker 3: For example, you can't

300
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:25,960
Speaker 1: swim.

301
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,320
Speaker 1: Humans

302
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,180
Speaker 3: aren't made to float.

303
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,580
Speaker 3: This is self-deception.

304
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,920
Speaker 3: I don't care what you want to call it.

305
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,180
Speaker 3: You have been shutting your eyes and covering your ears,

306
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,220
Speaker 3: making yourself blind and deaf to that which you wish to avoid.

307
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,800
Speaker 3: His sister was injured during the incident.

308
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,120
Speaker 2: Who cares what the others say?

309
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,780
Speaker 3: Leave.

310
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 3: See? You're running away from the reality again.

311
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Speaker 2: No, I don't want to hear this!

312
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:47,980
Speaker 2: No one

313
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,240
Speaker 3: can justify their existence

314
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,220
Speaker 3: by linking their happiest moments into a kind of rosary.

315
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,300
Speaker 3: In particular, I cannot.

316
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,620
Speaker 3: I cannot. I cannot.

317
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,100
Speaker 5: What's

318
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,800
Speaker 3: wrong with doing something I want to do?

319
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,920
Speaker 3: Why won't you

320
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,840
Speaker 6: leave me alone?

321
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,620
Speaker 2: The entry plug energy reserve should be reaching their expiration point about now.

322
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,980
Speaker 6: The plug sits life support system will be getting closer to redline.

323
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,000
Speaker 6: We'll advance the schedule by 12 minutes.

324
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,440
Speaker 6: Let's do it while there's a possibility that Shinji's still alive.

325
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,740
Speaker 3: Father, don't you want me?

326
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,460
Speaker 5: Father!

327
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,400
Speaker 4: That's right. He may be guilty of killing his own wife.

328
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,940
Speaker 4: He killed his own wife?

329
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,840
Speaker 2: No! Mother was... smiling.

330
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,260
Speaker 2: Shinji, you did something very important today.

331
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Speaker 6: Shinji, you must not run away.

332
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,680
Speaker 2: You've got to do your best.

333
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,840
Speaker 3: I hate this place.

334
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,680
Speaker 5: I hate

335
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
Speaker 3: this loneliness.

336
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,459
Speaker 3: I know.

337
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,579
Speaker 3: The heat system and the oxygen are giving out.

338
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,740
Speaker 3: I'm cold

339
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,720
Speaker 3: The suit is giving out too

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,540
Speaker 3: So cold

341
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,319
Speaker 3: This is the end

342
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,400
Speaker 3: So tired of everything

343
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,240
Speaker 5: Mother?

344
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,980
Speaker 3: Is this enough?

345
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,440
Speaker 3: Well, that's good for you.

346
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,440
Speaker 3: Both Avas are in

347
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,080
Speaker 5: position and

348
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,780
Speaker 3: standing by.

349
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,220
Speaker 2: AT fields are ready

350
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,700
Speaker 3: to generate.

351
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,560
Speaker 4: Roger.

352
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,760
Speaker 4: T-minus 60 seconds to mine drop.

353
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,160
Speaker 4: What the hell is that?

354
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,860
Speaker 7: What's going on?

355
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,960
Speaker 7: We don't know!

356
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,360
Speaker 7: All of our meters and gauges are going off the scale!

357
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,220
Speaker 7: But we haven't done anything yet!

358
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,700
Speaker 7: You think it could be Shinji?

359
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,580
Speaker 7: It's impossible!

360
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,760
Speaker 7: Uni-1's power level must be at zero!

361
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:54,960
Speaker 7: Whoa!

362
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,640
My god! Is that what I'm piloting?

363
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,580
Speaker 2: God in heaven, what kind of monster have we made this from?

364
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
Speaker 2: I know that the Evas are more than just copies of the first angel.

365
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,700
Speaker 2: But what is Nerve going to do with them?

366
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,220
Speaker 2: What is Nerve going to do with the Evas once all the angels have been destroyed?

367
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,720
*Screaming*

368
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,640
Speaker 5: Shindy! Shindy!

369
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,600
Shindy! Shindy!

370
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,040
Speaker 2: Shindy!

371
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,460
Speaker 1: Are you alright?

372
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,780
Speaker 3: I just wanted to see them one more time.

373
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,860
Speaker 4: Weren't you going to punish him?

374
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,740
Speaker 6: I've never seen the Eva looking as horrifying as it did today.

375
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,440
Speaker 6: Are the Evas really on our side?

376
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,060
Speaker 6: Or do they hate us?

377
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,280
Speaker 6: There's something else.

378
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,940
Speaker 6: I think that Major Katsuragi may suspect something.

379
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,660
Speaker 2: Let her be, at least for now.

380
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,000
Speaker 6: If Rei or Shinji were to learn about the Eva secrets, they'd never forgive us.

381
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,020
Speaker 8: You can rest today

382
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,740
Speaker 8: We'll take care of everything

383
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,800
Speaker 8: But I'm

384
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,520
Speaker 3: I'm feeling just fine now

385
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,860
Speaker 3: Well, that's good for you

386
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,380
Speaker 2: Huh?

387
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,240
Oh!

388
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:38,800
Oh!

389
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,900
Speaker 3: Ah...

390
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,180
Speaker 3: It still smells like blood.

391
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,380
I love you.

392
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,020
Speaker 5: I love

393
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,920
you.
