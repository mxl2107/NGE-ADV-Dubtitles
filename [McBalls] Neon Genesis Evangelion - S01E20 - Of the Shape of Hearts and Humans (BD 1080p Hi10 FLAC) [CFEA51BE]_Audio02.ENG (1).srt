1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,720
Speaker 1: The young man like a poor man

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,720
Speaker 1: You're a young man, you're a fairy tale

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,880
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now on the door

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:44,540
Speaker 1: I can't wait to see

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,339
Speaker 1: 遥か未来目指すための羽があること

6
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:14,200
Speaker 1: 残酷な天使のテゼ 窓辺からやがて飛び立つ

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,540
Speaker 1: ほとばしる熱いパッドスで 思い出を裏切るなら

8
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,320
Speaker 2: It's eating the angel.

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,720
Speaker 3: Those bindings allowed us to control it, but now the Ava is removing the web that binds it to our will.

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,280
Speaker 3: The beast inside the Ava is free at last!

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,220
Speaker 4: Unit 1's awakened and been set free.

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Speaker 4: Zaylay sure won't stay quiet about this, will they?

13
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,400
Speaker 5: This is insane.

14
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,340
Speaker 5: The Ava series aren't capable of generating S2 organs themselves,

15
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,820
Speaker 5: but we never imagined that one would be able to take one into itself this way.

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,600
Speaker 2: This incident is at extreme odds with the scenario we created.

17
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,920
Speaker 5: Gando Ikari.

18
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,880
Speaker 5: It was a mistake to

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Speaker 6: entrust nerve to him, wasn't it?

20
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,580
Speaker 7: Hmm.

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,440
Speaker 6: But he was the only one who could achieve this project's goals.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,440
Speaker 6: Ikari, what's going on in your mind?

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Speaker 6: It's begun at last.

24
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:41,860
Speaker 6: Indeed.

25
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:42,680
Speaker 6: This

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
Speaker 8: is the beginning.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,280
Speaker 9: The damage the Ava incurred is beyond the Hendlick limit.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,280
Speaker 9: Yes. It may be a while before we can restore everything to normal.

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,780
Speaker 9: Fortunately, the Magi system can be transferred to a new location.

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,060
Speaker 9: We may be able to begin working as early as tomorrow.

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,060
Speaker 9: This place isn't going to

32
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,000
Speaker 10: be viable anymore.

33
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,020
Speaker 10: It's just a matter of time before they decide to abandon it.

34
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,580
Speaker 10: Most likely.

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,960
Speaker 10: But for the time being, we'll have to use the secondary control center.

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,660
Speaker 10: Without the Magi?

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,600
Speaker 10: Yes. We'll clean the dust off and be back in business by this afternoon.

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
Speaker 9: But the chairs are too cramped down there and the sensors don't operate smoothly.

39
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,640
Speaker 9: It's difficult to work there.

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,120
Speaker 11: Well, at least the layout is the same as our original control center.

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,900
Speaker 9: At least we have

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,540
Speaker 10: an alternative.

43
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,520
Speaker 10: We have no choice when it comes to using Unit 1.

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,420
Speaker 2: It may be restrained by the cage, but are you sure it's safe?

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,300
Speaker 11: Well, no heat emissions, free electrons, electromagnetic fields, or chemical reactions,

46
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,420
Speaker 11: and the S2 unit's completely inactive.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,420
Speaker 2: Nevertheless, on three separate occasions, Unit 1 has moved without power.

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,020
Speaker 2: You can't judge this situation by just the things you can see.

49
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,060
Speaker 11: Uh-huh. We sure can't take any chances. That's a fact.

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,260
Speaker 11: It's as unpredictable as you are, Major.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Speaker 11: Uh... sorry.

52
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,299
Speaker 6: However, our concerns are not limited to Unit 1.

53
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:16,959
Speaker 6: Correct.

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,140
Speaker 7: Serious damage was sustained by Units 0 and 2. Headquarters was partially destroyed, exposing Central Dogma.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,580
Speaker 5: We can't even estimate how much money and time have been lost.

56
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,940
Speaker 5: This is because we didn't put a bell around

57
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,800
Speaker 6: Ikari's neck.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,200
Speaker 4: A bell was there,

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,300
Speaker 6: but it didn't ring.

60
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,580
Speaker 6: A bell that doesn't ring has no purpose. We'll make sure the bell works next time.

61
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,140
Speaker 4: My, my. What a completely unexpected situation.

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,640
Speaker 4: How will you explain this to the committee? I mean, to Sele?

63
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,380
Speaker 8: There isn't anything to explain. Unit 1 wasn't under our control. This was an accident.

64
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,700
Speaker 8: Thus, Unit 1 will remain frozen until the committee gives us further orders.

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,520
Speaker 8: Exactly.

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,880
Speaker 8: That is a very appropriate

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,160
Speaker 4: decision. However, isn't your son still trapped inside it?

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,200
Speaker 9: I knew this was hopeless. It's not accepting the eject code.

69
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,600
Speaker 9: What about the backup codes?

70
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,820
Speaker 9: Also refused. Even a direct circuit isn't getting through.

71
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,960
Speaker 11: But the plug's video monitor's still active. I'm channeling it to the main screen.

72
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,760
Speaker 10: What in the hell is this?

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,220
Speaker 10: This is the truth behind a 400% sync ratio.

74
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,640
Speaker 2: I can't believe it! What happened to Shinji?

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,120
Speaker 2: He's

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
Speaker 10: been taken into Eva Unit 1.

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,780
Speaker 10: Take it into it? What in the hell is an Ava?

78
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,680
Speaker 10: It's a thing created by man in man's own image.

79
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,840
Speaker 10: I really can't describe it any other way.

80
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
Speaker 10: Created by man?

81
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,180
Speaker 10: You didn't create anything.

82
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,440
Speaker 10: You just copied something you found in the Antarctic.

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,420
Speaker 10: What was the original? That's what I want to know.

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
Speaker 10: This is not just a copy.

85
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,180
Speaker 10: A human will is inside it.

86
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,540
Speaker 10: Are you saying somebody willed this to happen?

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,760
Speaker 10: Yes, the Ava did.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,660
Speaker 2: Do something, damn it!

89
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,220
Speaker 2: You created this, didn't you?

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
Speaker 2: Take responsibility for what

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,520
Speaker 12: you've done!

92
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,740
Speaker 13: I'm still alive.

93
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,420
Speaker 13: I know that Wonder Girl's still alive!

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Speaker 13: Don't bother me with trivial crap like that, Misato!

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,440
Speaker 13: I can't believe it.

96
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
Speaker 3: I couldn't do anything.

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,320
Speaker 3: I can't believe that stupid Shinji outperformed me.

98
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,160
I can't stand it.

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,540
Speaker 10: What do

100
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,140
Speaker 2: you mean you're

101
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,680
Speaker 10: going to salvage Shinji?

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,060
Speaker 10: Well, theoretically, Shinji's life force still exists in there.

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,080
Speaker 10: Ha! And will you be respecting that life this time?

104
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,240
Speaker 10: Losing Shinji is out of the question now.

105
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,560
Speaker 10: Oh, I don't know.

106
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,740
Speaker 10: What Nerve wants is Unit 1 as their tool, not Shinji.

107
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,740
Speaker 10: I don't deny

108
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,120
Speaker 9: it.

109
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,200
Speaker 9: Our assumption is that Shinji's body lost its ego border,

110
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,780
Speaker 9: and that he's now floating in the entry plug in quantum form.

111
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,460
Speaker 9: You're saying that Shinji has shifted into a form we can't see?

112
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,080
Speaker 9: Yes. The LCL has chemically altered into something very similar to the seawater of primitive Earth.

113
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,680
Speaker 10: In fact, it's almost identical to the primordial soup we've duplicated in laboratories.

114
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,100
Speaker 10: Primordial soup?

115
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,580
Speaker 10: Yes. All of the substances which composed Shinji are still preserved in the plug,

116
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,540
Speaker 10: and his soul exists there as well.

117
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,820
Speaker 10: In fact, his ego image is giving a

118
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,500
Speaker 9: sort of substance to his plug suit.

119
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,640
Speaker 9: In other words, this salvage operation must both reconstruct his body and return his soul into it.

120
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,840
Speaker 9: Is that possible?

121
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,680
Speaker 9: Possible?

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,640
Speaker 10: With the Magi's support? Yes, it is.

123
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:41,840
Speaker 10: This

124
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,220
Speaker 2: is all theoretical stuff you're talking about, isn't it?

125
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,780
Speaker 2: You won't know what will really happen until you do it.

126
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,100
Speaker 14: What is this? Where am I?

127
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,660
Speaker 14: The entry plug of Unit 1?

128
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,160
Speaker 14: But there's nobody here.

129
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,640
Speaker 14: Not even myself.

130
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:06,620
Speaker 14: What is this?

131
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,140
Speaker 14: I don't understand.

132
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,020
Speaker 14: These people.

133
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,460
Speaker 14: Yes, they're people I know.

134
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,800
Speaker 14: People who know me.

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Speaker 14: I understand now.

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,580
Speaker 14: This is my world.

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,420
Speaker 14: What is this?

138
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,780
Speaker 14: This is supposed to be my world, but this I don't understand.

139
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,100
Speaker 14: An image from outside.

140
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,460
Speaker 14: A hostile image?

141
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,980
Speaker 14: That's right.

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,680
Speaker 14: The enemy.

143
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,020
Speaker 14: Enemy.

144
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:30,780
Speaker 14: Enemy.

145
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,620
Speaker 14: Enemy.

146
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:32,280
Speaker 14: Enemy.

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,800
Speaker 14: Our enemies are something called angels.

148
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,599
Speaker 14: They have the names of the angels, too.

149
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,659
Speaker 14: They are the targets of Eva and Nerve.

150
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,039
Speaker 14: This is our revenge for the death of Misato's father.

151
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,539
Speaker 14: But why do I fight?

152
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,500
Speaker 14: Why do I do this despite all the pain and suffering?

153
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,760
Speaker 13: What are you, stupid?

154
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Speaker 13: An unknown enemy is attacking us.

155
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,100
Speaker 13: Of course we have to fight them.

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,260
Speaker 13: Who cares what they think?

157
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,080
Speaker 14: Am I odd to try to find a reason to fight?

158
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,160
Speaker 14: Am I not supposed to think about it?

159
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,180
Speaker 14: Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy.

160
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,460
Speaker 14: All are my enemies.

161
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,040
Speaker 14: That which threatens us is the enemy.

162
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,660
Speaker 14: Of course, how can I be faulted for protecting my own life and those of others?

163
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,220
Speaker 14: Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy.

164
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
Speaker 14: My enemy. Enemy. Enemy.

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,180
Speaker 14: My enemy.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Speaker 14: Damn it. Damn it. God damn it.

167
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,340
Speaker 14: You hurt Doji and killed my mother!

168
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,700
FATHER!

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,100
Speaker 14: Why do you hate your father?

170
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Speaker 14: Anyone would hate him. He's no father at all.

171
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,100
Speaker 14: You don't understand him, do you?

172
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,140
Speaker 14: Of course not. In 14 years, I've hardly ever even seen him.

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
Speaker 14: Is that why you hate him?

174
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,460
Speaker 14: Yes. My father doesn't need me.

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,420
Speaker 14: My father deserted me!

176
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,520
Speaker 14: Am I a substitute?

177
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,340
Speaker 14: Yes! That's got to be it!

178
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
Speaker 14: He abandoned me because he already

179
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,840
Speaker 2: had Ayanami!

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,020
Speaker 2: As if you didn't already run away yourself.

181
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,180
Speaker 14: No! It's all his fault!

182
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,160
Speaker 14: That time I was actually going to tell him I hate him!

183
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,060
Speaker 14: Did you make me become a pilot just to make me suffer?

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,600
Speaker 5: Correct.

185
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,060
Speaker 14: How can you say that?!

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,220
Speaker 14: You have to be so called! It's not fair!

187
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,200
Speaker 14: You didn't even need me, did you?

188
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,240
Speaker 4: I called you because I had a use for you.

189
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,660
Speaker 14: But why? Why is it me?

190
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,600
Speaker 8: Because there is no one else who can do it.

191
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,840
Speaker 14: No way. Why haven't I ever seen this before?

192
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,440
Speaker 14: It's not fair! It's not possible!

193
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,920
Speaker 14: That's right! I already knew Ava!

194
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,660
Speaker 14: I already knew Ava!

195
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,120
Speaker 14: And then I ran away, leaving my father and mother behind!

196
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,360
Speaker 5: Current

197
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Speaker 10: concentration of

198
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,420
Speaker 1: LCL stable at 36.

199
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,580
Speaker 1: Oxygen concentration is nominal.

200
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,140
Speaker 5: Electromagnetic radiation pulse is normal.

201
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,560
Speaker 5: Weight pattern is zero.

202
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,800
Speaker 1: All counters are functioning normally.

203
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,660
Speaker 9: Salvage operation guidelines.

204
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,360
Speaker 9: It's incredible that you were able to come up with all this in just one month.

205
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,220
Speaker 10: Thanks for the credit, but this isn't all my work.

206
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,880
Speaker 10: The majority of this data is from ten years ago.

207
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,580
Speaker 10: What

208
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,720
Speaker 9: data from ten years ago?

209
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Speaker 9: Has this happened before?

210
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,920
Speaker 9: Yes, but it was before I started working here.

211
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,960
Speaker 10: It was during my mother's time.

212
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,000
Speaker 10: But I can still pick her brains.

213
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,960
Speaker 9: Then how

214
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,480
Speaker 10: did it come out ten years ago?

215
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,880
Speaker 10: They didn't succeed.

216
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,540
Speaker 14: Kindness.

217
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,800
Speaker 14: Warmth.

218
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,900
Speaker 14: Is this warmth a part of being human?

219
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,060
Speaker 14: I was never aware of it until now.

220
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,560
Speaker 14: I was never aware of it before, but now I think I know what it is.

221
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,800
Speaker 14: I didn't know what it was, but now I think I understand.

222
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,020
Speaker 14: They are.

223
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,520
Speaker 14: Because... because I pilot an Ava.

224
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,420
Speaker 14: That's why they treat me so well. That's the reason I keep going on.

225
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,300
Speaker 14: It's the justification for my continuing existence.

226
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,080
Speaker 14: Who and why I am.

227
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,340
Speaker 14: That's why I have to pilot the Ava.

228
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,660
Speaker 14: To fight.

229
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,760
Speaker 14: I have to fight the ones that they call our enemy.

230
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,520
Speaker 14: That I have to win.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,440
Speaker 14: That's right. I can't lose.

232
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,300
Speaker 14: I must be the pilot.

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,240
Speaker 14: I must do what they tell me to do.

234
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,760
Speaker 14: And I've got to win.

235
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,420
Speaker 14: Just like they tell me to.

236
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,240
Speaker 14: Otherwise, I'm nobody.

237
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,680
Speaker 14: Nobody.

238
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,540
Work hard.

239
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 10: Work hard, Shinji.

240
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,620
Speaker 10: Get to work, you stupid idiot.

241
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,180
Speaker 10: Yeah, work hard.

242
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,620
Speaker 14: You gotta work hard.

243
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,200
Speaker 7: Good job, Shinji.

244
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,080
Speaker 14: Misato, Ritsuko, Asuka, Toji, Kinsuke, Father.

245
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,940
Speaker 14: They all respect me.

246
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,040
Speaker 14: They respect me when I pilot the Eva.

247
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,440
Speaker 14: They all respect me.

248
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,740
Speaker 14: They respect this totally worthless being.

249
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,600
Speaker 14: They all tell me piloted, so I'll prove to my father that I'm worth something.

250
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,220
Speaker 14: Work hard, Shinji.

251
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,200
Speaker 14: But I am working hard. I am.

252
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,780
Speaker 14: Somebody, please. Somebody be nice to me.

253
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,840
Speaker 14: I fought so much. I'm doing the best I can.

254
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
Speaker 14: Can't you treat me better? Can't you be nice to me?

255
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,480
Speaker 14: Why can't you be nice to me?

256
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,120
Speaker 2: I'm nice to you.

257
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Speaker 2: Tell me, Shinji, do you want to become one with me?

258
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,040
Speaker 2: To be of one mind and body?

259
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,860
Speaker 2: It could be very, very nice.

260
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,680
Speaker 2: Ask me anytime. I'm ready.

261
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,660
Speaker 2: Hey,

262
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
Speaker 13: Shinji, you idiot.

263
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,020
Speaker 13: Don't you want to be one with me?

264
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,760
Speaker 13: To be of one mind and body?

265
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,920
Speaker 13: It would be really awesome.

266
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,000
Speaker 13: You ought to appreciate your good fortune.

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,420
Speaker 13: Come on.

268
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,740
Speaker 2: Ikari.

269
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,260
Speaker 2: Do you want to become one with me?

270
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,620
Speaker 2: To be of one mind and body?

271
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,240
Speaker 2: It could be very pleasant.

272
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,200
Speaker 2: Shinji?

273
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,040
Speaker 2: Do you want to become one with me?

274
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,540
Speaker 2: To be of one mind and body and soul?

275
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,640
Speaker 2: It could be very pleasant.

276
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,080
Speaker 2: Relax and release your soul.

277
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,820
Speaker 14: All of the probes have been inserted.

278
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,880
Speaker 14: Electromagnetic radius is fixed at zero minus three.

279
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,060
Speaker 9: Eagle water pulse connection is complete.

280
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,480
Speaker 9: Roger, start the salvage operation.

281
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,880
Speaker 11: Initiating program. Transmitting burst signal.

282
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,200
Speaker 11: Signal received. No rejection.

283
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,200
Speaker 9: Proceed to send the second and third signals.

284
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,960
Speaker 10: Affirmative. Shift the subject to stage two.

285
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,380
Speaker 10: Come on, Shinji.

286
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,160
Speaker 2: Stupid Shinji.

287
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,800
Speaker 11: Shinji

288
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Speaker 2: Akari.

289
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,500
Speaker 11: Hey, Shinji!

290
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,880
Speaker 2: Yo, Shinji!

291
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,060
Speaker 2: Ikari.

292
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,160
Speaker 2: Shinji.

293
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,300
Speaker 2: Stupid Shinji.

294
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,280
Speaker 2: Shinji Ikari.

295
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,400
Speaker 2: Hey, Shinji.

296
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,420
Speaker 2: Yo, Shinji!

297
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,240
Speaker 2: Ikari.

298
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:17,960
Speaker 7: Shinji.

299
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,760
Speaker 7: Stupid Shinji.

300
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,040
Speaker 7: Stupid Shinji.

301
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,500
Speaker 7: Shinji Ikari.

302
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,500
Speaker 9: It's no good!

303
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,060
Speaker 9: His ego borderline is frozen into a fixed loop!

304
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,400
Speaker 9: Try to radiate the wave patterns from all directions!

305
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,660
Speaker 3: My god!

306
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,880
Speaker 3: All of the radiated signals are being trapped in Klein space!

307
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,240
Speaker 3: What does that mean?

308
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,440
Speaker 3: It means we failed.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,940
Speaker 3: Abort intervention!

310
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,520
Speaker 3: Reverse the tangent graph!

311
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,240
Speaker 3: Set the addition value at zero.

312
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:42,760
Speaker 3: Right!

313
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,760
Speaker 11: Distudo reaction in the Q area.

314
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,040
Speaker 11: Pattern is sepia.

315
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Speaker 11: I've got a change in the core pulse 2!

316
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,140
Speaker 11: Plus O3, confirm!

317
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,100
Speaker 3: Maintaining current condition has

318
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,560
Speaker 9: priority!

319
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,720
Speaker 9: Stop that backbone!

320
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,360
Speaker 9: Right!

321
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,360
Speaker 9: Plus.5!

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,160
Speaker 9: .8!

323
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,400
Speaker 9: This is all wrong!

324
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,840
Speaker 9: I can't stop it!

325
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,580
Speaker 9: What's going on?!

326
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,960
Speaker 14: Don't you want to come back?

327
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,120
Speaker 14: Why, Shinji?

328
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,340
Speaker 14: I don't...

329
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,780
Speaker 14: I don't understand myself.

330
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,840
Speaker 14: I...

331
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,680
Speaker 14: What do I want?

332
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
Speaker 15: What do you want?

333
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,080
Speaker 15: What do you want, Shinji?

334
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,200
Speaker 9: The EVA is rejecting the

335
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,480
Speaker 15: signal!

336
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,320
Speaker 11: Shinji's ego formation is disintegrating in the LCL!

337
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,120
Speaker 11: Pressure in the plug is increasing!

338
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,940
Speaker 11: Aboard all operations! Power

339
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,400
Speaker 9: down!

340
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,520
Speaker 9: It's not working! The plug is being ejected!

341
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:30,860
Speaker 9: *BOOM*

342
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,300
Speaker 9: *BOOM*

343
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,500
Speaker 14: SHANJI!

344
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,800
*GASP*

345
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,220
Speaker 14: Where am I?

346
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,580
Speaker 14: Inside the Ava!

347
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,780
Speaker 14: Inside the Ava?

348
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,920
Speaker 14: Did I pilot the Ava again?

349
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,140
Speaker 14: But why?

350
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,500
Speaker 14: You won't pilot the Ava anymore?

351
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,140
Speaker 14: I decided that I would never pilot Ava again.

352
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,620
Speaker 2: But you have just piloted Evangelion Unit 1.

353
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,100
Speaker 2: Shinji, you are here because you have piloted the Eva.

354
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,480
Speaker 2: Piloting the Eva has created your present.

355
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,180
Speaker 2: You can

356
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,300
Speaker 16: never deny your past,

357
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:07,720
Speaker 2: Shinji.

358
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,079
Speaker 2: Nor can you deny the fact that you did indeed pilot it once more.

359
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,760
Speaker 2: That which is, is.

360
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,579
Speaker 2: It's true.

361
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,339
Speaker 2: I just wanted to tell you that only you can decide.

362
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,699
Speaker 2: It's your future.

363
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,579
Speaker 2: Only you can decide, Shinji.

364
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,800
Speaker 2: You must make a choice.

365
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,699
Speaker 14: I...

366
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,000
Speaker 2: I...

367
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,040
Speaker 2: I am science! It can't even save one small life!

368
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,160
Speaker 2: Give me back my Shinji!

369
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,740
Speaker 2: GIVE HIM BACK!

370
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:46,460
Speaker 14: That scent... a human smell...

371
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,600
Speaker 14: Misato?

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,840
Speaker 14: Ayanami?

373
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,040
Speaker 14: No, not that.

374
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,440
Speaker 14: That's right.

375
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,620
Speaker 14: This is the smell of my mother.

376
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,660
Speaker 14: The second

377
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,020
Speaker 8: impact has occurred. Must he live in this hell?

378
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,180
Speaker 15: Anywhere can be heaven, as long as you try to live.

379
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,780
Speaker 15: And because he is alive, for as long as he lives, he will have a chance to attain happiness.

380
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,180
Speaker 4: Of course. You're right.

381
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:22,100
Speaker 15: Mother? Have you decided yet?

382
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,760
Speaker 14: If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl, I'll name the baby, Rei.

383
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,160
Speaker 15: Shinji, Rei,

384
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,420
good names.

385
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,320
Speaker 16: Mother.

386
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,060
Speaker 7: Shinji?

387
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,640
Speaker 7: Shinji!

388
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,480
Speaker 10: Well, Unit 1's restoration ought to be finished by the day after tomorrow.

389
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,880
Speaker 10: So even when they're given divine power, human beings still treat it as a matter of fact.

390
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,740
Speaker 10: I can hardly agree with that.

391
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
Speaker 10: Speaking of which, the committee is looking at freezing the Evas.

392
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
Speaker 2: The Evangelion androids.

393
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,720
Speaker 2: They may be man-made, but who knows what lurks inside that black box.

394
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,780
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

395
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,160
Speaker 2: I'm just glad that Shinji's

396
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,040
Speaker 10: life was saved.

397
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,700
Speaker 10: No thanks to me. The credit probably goes to you.

398
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,340
Speaker 10: Hey, you want to go bar hopping tonight?

399
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
Speaker 2: Uh, sorry.

400
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,580
Speaker 2: I've got to go somewhere.

401
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,760
See ya!

402
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,880
Speaker 10: Shinji's just been saved and she's already running to her lover?

403
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,720
Speaker 10: Well, I guess I can't blame her.

404
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,160
Speaker 2: Ritsuko must be thinking I'm pretty disgusting.

405
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,080
Speaker 4: Appearing to give in to our sexual desires makes for a more realistic appearance.

406
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,820
Speaker 4: A good deception.

407
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,020
Speaker 2: Deceive the intelligence department?

408
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,100
Speaker 2: Or the commander in Ritzko? Or me?

409
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,820
Speaker 4: No, no. I meant myself.

410
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,800
Speaker 2: You want to fool the others?

411
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,380
Speaker 2: You never show interest in others, but you want their attention.

412
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,440
Speaker 2: You really are just like my dad.

413
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,260
Speaker 4: I didn't know you still smoked.

414
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,720
Speaker 2: I only smoke after this sort of thing, so nobody knows but you.

415
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,520
Speaker 2: Here's smoke in your eyes.

416
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,900
Speaker 4: Really? I'm honored.

417
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
Speaker 2: And how's instrumentality going?

418
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
Speaker 2: Adam could wipe out mankind.

419
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,520
Speaker 2: Why is he being kept there?

420
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 4: Did you come to see me just to learn that?

421
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,600
Speaker 2: Yeah.

422
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,620
Speaker 2: Well, actually, that's one of the reasons.

423
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,700
Speaker 2: It

424
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,220
Speaker 4: would be my honor to be used as my lady's cat's paw.

425
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,580
Speaker 4: But I can't.

426
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,700
Speaker 2: I just want you to know what I want.

427
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,540
Speaker 2: What are Nerve and Commander Ikari really planning?

428
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,620
Speaker 4: I'd like to know that myself.

429
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,060
Speaker 2: Hey, you can't dodge my questions by doing that.

430
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,560
Speaker 2: No, don't put strange things in there.

431
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,800
Speaker 2: What are you doing?

432
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,860
Speaker 2: I can't believe this.

433
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,580
Speaker 2: What?

434
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,500
Speaker 7: What is this?

435
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,500
Speaker 4: This is for you.

436
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,580
Speaker 4: The first time in eight years.

437
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,840
Speaker 4: And maybe the last as well.

438
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,560
piano plays softly

439
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,260
Thank you.

440
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,620
Speaker 12: Vice Commander Futsuki is abducted by Xaeli and memories of the past pass through his mind.

441
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,320
Speaker 12: Memories of what started in Kyoto in 1999.

442
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,860
Speaker 12: Will Nerve be enough of a fortress for mankind?

443
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,260
Speaker 12: Next episode, the birth of Nerve.
