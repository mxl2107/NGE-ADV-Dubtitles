1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at you,

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: I'm smiling.

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,940
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to see you,

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,520
Speaker 1: I'm not even curious.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Speaker 1: I'm still not sure about you,

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,140
Speaker 1: but I'm not sure about you.

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,860
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you'll notice that

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:03,780
Speaker 1: The back of the future is a great place to look for the future

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,520
Speaker 1: The cruel and cruel world of the world will soon be

11
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,460
Speaker 1: The dark world will soon be on the edge of the world

12
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,600
The

13
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,200
*Bad*

14
00:02:49,320 --> 00:03:01,480
Speaker 2: Although there was a great deal of damage as a result, the fact that Shinji Ikari, a boy with no prior EVA experience, managed to accomplish the mission against an unknown enemy, deserves special notice.

15
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:14,500
Speaker 2: However, for the Department of Strategic Operations, it was a difficult battle that would reveal many problem areas that were in desperate need of improvement.

16
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,340
Speaker 3: *Gunshot

17
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,520
Speaker 3: so stupid. I'm gonna find the jerks who hurt my sister and teach them a lesson they'll

18
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,140
Speaker 3: never forget.

19
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,180
Speaker 4: We'd already had a lot of evacuation training at the school, so we didn't really think it was that serious.

20
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,660
Speaker 4: The guys were all acting like jerks as usual, like they were on a field trip, and none of the girls were afraid either.

21
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:54,520
Speaker 5: I'm not sure

22
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,380
*BANG*

23
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,180
*Gunshot*

24
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:05,240
Speaker 6: Shinji never really told me what really happened, but if I had to guess, I'd say that Rei must have tried to sacrifice herself in order to protect Unit 1 from the enemy's particle beam.

25
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,760
Speaker 6: The reason I'm so sure about this is Rei herself. I don't think she has much respect for her own existence.

26
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,760
Speaker 6: She's not just pessimistic. Hell, a lot of kids our age are like that.

27
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Speaker 6: No, it's something much, much more. But nobody ever tells me nothing.

28
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,740
Speaker 6: Then...

29
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,540
*Ezio

30
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,500
Speaker 7: The United Nations combined Navy lost one third of its entire fleet in this encounter.

31
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,720
Speaker 7: At least the lost ships belong to your country. The damage is negligible.

32
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,900
Speaker 8: Quite true. It was fortunate that so much of the damage was inconsequential.

33
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,980
*Gunshot*

34
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
YAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!

35
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,840
*Squeak*

36
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm sorry.

37
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,280
The End

38
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,380
*Gun

39
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,220
Speaker 9: Hmm, this isn't good. It's happening too early.

40
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,740
Speaker 8: Yes. This did not occur in accordance with our predictions of when an Angel would invade Nerv.

41
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:54,820
Speaker 8: And

42
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,960
Speaker 7: to make it worse, you let it intrude into Central Dogma itself.

43
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,680
Speaker 7: If contact had occurred, then our entire project

44
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,720
Speaker 8: could have ended in disaster, Ikari.

45
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,420
Speaker 8: The report to this committee was in error. There is no fact behind this tale of an Angel invasion.

46
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,240
Speaker 9: Ikari, are you saying that the Eleventh Angel's intrusion never occurred?

47
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,480
Speaker 9: Yes.

48
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,960
Speaker 8: Watch your words carefully, Ikari. Lying to this committee is perishable by death.

49
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,480
Speaker 8: If you wish confirmation, check the Magi's data recorders. No such incident was ever recorded.

50
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,320
Speaker 9: This is absurd.

51
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,180
Speaker 8: We all

52
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,980
Speaker 9: know that bearing the

53
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,240
Speaker 10: truth is your specialty.

54
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,120
Speaker 10: The time

55
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,320
Speaker 8: schedule is being carried out in accordance with the descriptions in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

56
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,700
Speaker 10: Alright, we won't discuss any possible guilt or punishment this time.

57
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,980
Speaker 10: However, let me remind you that you won't rewrite our scenario.

58
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,900
Speaker 8: I understand. Everything is proceeding according to Zayle's plan.

59
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,540
Speaker 11: Mountains.

60
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,640
Speaker 11: Heavier the mountains.

61
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,940
Speaker 11: But that changes.

62
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,340
Speaker 11: With the passage of time.

63
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:10,900
Speaker 11: Sky.

64
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,560
Speaker 11: Blue sky.

65
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,080
Speaker 11: What your eyes can't see.

66
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Speaker 11: What your eyes can see.

67
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,200
Speaker 11: The sun.

68
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,200
Speaker 1: One.

69
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
Speaker 11: Only one.

70
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,740
Speaker 11: Water.

71
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,440
Speaker 11: It is agreeable.

72
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,080
Speaker 11: Commander Ikari.

73
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,480
Speaker 11: Flowers. So many the same.

74
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,040
Speaker 11: So many without purpose.

75
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,920
Speaker 11: Sky. Sky of red.

76
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,040
Speaker 11: Red the color. The color I hate.

77
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,040
Speaker 11: The liquid flows. It drips, ripples and pours.

78
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,460
Speaker 11: Blood.

79
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,060
Speaker 11: A scent of blood, a woman who does not bleed.

80
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Speaker 11: From the red soil the humans come. Humans made by man and woman.

81
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,140
Speaker 11: City, a human creation.

82
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Speaker 11: Ava, a human creation as well.

83
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,540
Speaker 11: What are humans? Are they creations of God?

84
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,720
Speaker 11: Humans are that which is created by humans.

85
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,420
Speaker 11: This is that which is mine. My life. My heart.

86
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,900
Speaker 11: I am a vessel for my thoughts. The entry plug. Throne of the soul.

87
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,500
Speaker 11: Who is this? This is me. Who am I? What am I? What am I? What am I?

88
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,220
Speaker 11: I am I. This object that is, is myself. That which forms is me.

89
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,580
Speaker 11: This is the self that can be seen and yet this is not like that which is myself.

90
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,240
Speaker 11: A strange feeling. My body feels as if it is melting.

91
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,240
Speaker 11: I can no longer see myself. My form, my shape, fades from view.

92
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,980
Speaker 11: Awareness dawns of someone who is not me. Who is here, there, beyond me here.

93
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,740
Speaker 11: Shinji...

94
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,620
Speaker 11: This person I know, Major Katsuraki.

95
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,300
Speaker 11: Dr. Akaki.

96
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,320
Speaker 11: People.

97
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,600
Speaker 11: My classmates.

98
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,540
Speaker 11: The

99
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,980
Speaker 5: pilot of

100
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,580
Speaker 12: Unit 2.

101
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,940
Speaker 11: Commander Ikari?

102
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,760
Speaker 11: Who are you?

103
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,180
Speaker 12: Who are you?

104
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,540
Speaker 12: Who are you?

105
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,320
Speaker 12: So, Rei, how does it feel to be piloting Unit 1 for the first time?

106
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,920
Speaker 5: Smells like Ikari.

107
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,820
Speaker 13: The sync ratio is almost the same as with Unit Zero.

108
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,880
Speaker 13: Unit Zero and Unit One's personal data patterns are almost identical.

109
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,360
Speaker 13: That's what makes this sync experiment possible.

110
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,180
Speaker 13: Error margin is 0.03. Harmonics are normal.

111
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,860
Speaker 13: No detectable problems found for compatibility between Ray and Unit One.

112
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:39,880
Speaker 13: Okay,

113
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,900
Speaker 12: the test is over, Ray. You can get out now.

114
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,220
Speaker 12: Yes.

115
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,580
*BANG*

116
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Speaker 2: Subject status?

117
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,040
Speaker 13: A bit jittery, but no problems found in the nerve patterns.

118
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,460
Speaker 2: This is his first time in Unit Zero.

119
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,680
Speaker 2: His first time piloting another Ava. It's only natural.

120
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,940
Speaker 14: That's stupid. Why should he care which Ava he's in anyway?

121
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,560
Speaker 14: It makes a difference to Shinji. That's how he is.

122
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,120
Speaker 14: I know that. He's such a dork.

123
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,680
Speaker 14: So why aren't you running these compatibility tests on me? Is there something wrong with me?

124
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,880
Speaker 14: Well, we didn't think he'd want to pilot any Ava except

125
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,340
Speaker 2: yours.

126
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,180
Speaker 14: Yeah, that's

127
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,300
Speaker 2: true, isn't it?

128
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,300
Speaker 2: I don't know if Unit 2 would even be compatible.

129
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,960
Beginning entry. LCL

130
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,140
Speaker 15: electrolyzed.

131
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Speaker 12: Commence first connection.

132
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,040
Speaker 1: Shinji,

133
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,260
Speaker 13: how do you feel in Unit 0's entry plug?

134
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Speaker 1: It feels kind of weird.

135
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,380
Speaker 15: Like incompatibility?

136
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,520
Speaker 1: Not like that.

137
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,640
Speaker 1: This thing

138
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,660
smells like rain.

139
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,860
Speaker 12: It smells like what?

140
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,300
Speaker 14: That's a mensch.

141
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,320
Speaker 12: Data received.

142
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,320
Speaker 12: Reconfirming.

143
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,340
Speaker 13: Pattern green.

144
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,040
Speaker 12: All restraints are nominal.

145
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,000
Speaker 13: Acknowledged.

146
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,840
Speaker 13: Now let's shift the mutual compatibility test to the second stage.

147
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Speaker 13: Unit zero, entering second contact.

148
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,420
Speaker 13: How's it look?

149
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Speaker 13: As I thought.

150
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,300
Speaker 13: The sync ratio is lower than that of unit one.

151
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,980
Speaker 13: Hmm, harmonics are all normal.

152
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,280
Speaker 13: But these are still good readings.

153
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,380
Speaker 13: These numbers mean that we can implement our current plan.

154
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,020
Speaker 13: You mean the tummy system? Ma'am, I'm really not sure that we should proceed.

155
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,780
Speaker 13: I understand your feelings on this, but we always have to be prepared for all options.

156
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,920
Speaker 13: It's our guarantee of survival.

157
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,460
Speaker 13: You know that I've always respected you, ma'am, and I still believe in our work.

158
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,580
Speaker 13: But I'm afraid I'm really not convinced.

159
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:00,540
Speaker 13: People who develop too many scruples will always have some difficulty working amongst others.

160
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,319
Speaker 13: You'll learn once you've gotten your hands dirty. You'll see.

161
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,900
*Gasp*

162
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,900
Speaker 16: Initiate third connection.

163
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,400
Speaker 16: Self-state of Minecraft is stable.

164
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,339
Speaker 13: It's Shinji missing Mama's breath.

165
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,319
Speaker 13: Has it been in her womb or what?

166
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,040
Speaker 13: Asuka, stop interrupting. You're being obnoxious.

167
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,240
Speaker 14: Yeah, yeah. I don't get it. Why does everyone around here always pamper him?

168
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,920
Speaker 13: Commence A10 nerve connections. Harmonics level plus 20.

169
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,320
Speaker 1: What the hell? Something's trying to get into my brain.

170
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,360
Speaker 1: Uh...

171
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,740
Uh...

172
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,340
Speaker 11: W-Rei?

173
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,720
Speaker 12: Uh...Rei Ayanami?

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Speaker 12: Ah...

175
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,380
Speaker 12: This feeling...impression...

176
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,180
Speaker 12: Rei...

177
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,200
Speaker 12: It's hers!

178
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,180
Speaker 12: What's happening?!

179
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,500
Speaker 12: There's

180
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,940
Speaker 7: a problem in the pilot's nerve pulse!

181
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,460
Speaker 12: Mental contamination starting!

182
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,880
Speaker 12: Impossible! This can't happen at this plug tap!

183
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,120
Speaker 12: It's not FROM the plug!

184
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,000
Speaker 12: The intrusion is coming from the angle!

185
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,840
Speaker 12: Unit zero is out of control!

186
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,380
Speaker 12: Shut all circuits!

187
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,340
Speaker 12: Cut the power!

188
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,060
Speaker 12: Ava switched to reserve power!

189
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,120
Speaker 12: Ava

190
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,860
Speaker 3: is still activated.

191
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,460
Speaker 12: Shinji status!

192
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,640
Speaker 3: The circuit's closed.

193
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,680
Speaker 3: We can't monitor him!

194
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,200
Speaker 3: Unit

195
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,740
Speaker 12: zero is rejecting Shinji.

196
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,320
Speaker 12: Negative! The auto-ejection! It doesn't work!

197
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Speaker 12: The same error. The same one.

198
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,060
Speaker 12: Is it trying to absorb Shinji?

199
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,420
Speaker 15: Break it back here!

200
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,660
Speaker 15: Break it!

201
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,740
Speaker 15: Activation will terminate in seven seconds!

202
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Speaker 15: Six, five, four,

203
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,780
three, two, one, zero!

204
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,700
Speaker 2: Zero, activation terminated.

205
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,060
Speaker 2: Hurry up and get the pilot out of there!

206
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
Speaker 2: Did Unit Zero just try to kill Ray?

207
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,960
Speaker 2: Do you think this could be related to the incident that occurred when Ray was the pilot?

208
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,740
Speaker 2: I can't tell you much right now.

209
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,880
Speaker 2: The only thing I'm sure of is that we must reconfigure Unit Zero for Ray's personal data

210
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,120
Speaker 2: and run a new synchronization test between Ray and the Zero as soon as possible.

211
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,580
Speaker 2: As the director of operations, I request that it be done as soon as possible,

212
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,260
Speaker 2: before there are further problems.

213
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,660
Speaker 2: I understand that,

214
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,720
Speaker 13: Major Katsuragi.

215
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:43,940
Speaker 13: Right.

216
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,680
Speaker 13: Unit Zero wanted to attack me.

217
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,320
Speaker 13: That's got to be it.

218
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:21,960
Speaker 15: He said hello. Do you understand me? He said yeah. This is great. So what's the top of the house? He said room. And what's the texture of sandpaper there? This is amazing. He said rubbed. And who's

219
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,240
the greatest baseball player of all time?

220
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,660
Speaker 1: Again, I hate this ceiling.

221
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,380
Speaker 1: The

222
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,260
Speaker 16: hospital says Shinji has regained consciousness.

223
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,120
Speaker 6: No signs of mental contamination.

224
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,880
Speaker 6: But he doesn't remember what happened.

225
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,020
Speaker 14: Right.

226
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,060
Speaker 14: Misato and Kashi won't tell me anything about her.

227
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,600
Speaker 14: Even Shinji doesn't know anything.

228
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,220
Speaker 14: Just what is the first child?

229
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,580
Speaker 16: The Angels' invasion of headquarters was a deviation from our scheduled scenario.

230
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,960
Speaker 16: The committees found out about it and are applying pressure.

231
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,120
Speaker 16: They're buzzing around

232
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,340
Speaker 8: our heads like a swarm of hornets, looking for things to complain about.

233
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,280
Speaker 8: We hold all the tiles, all the winds and dragons. There is nothing they can do.

234
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,900
Speaker 8: That doesn't mean we want to keep tipping

235
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,540
Speaker 16: our hand.

236
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,420
Speaker 8: If Sele starts to interfere,

237
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,100
Speaker 16: there could

238
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,640
Speaker 8: be trouble.

239
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,040
Speaker 8: Everything is going according to the scenario.

240
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,640
Speaker 8: No problems exist.

241
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,240
Speaker 8: What about

242
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,520
Speaker 16: the Unit Zero incident?

243
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,220
Speaker 16: That was not in our scenario.

244
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,040
Speaker 16: It will have no effect. Ray's

245
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,800
Speaker 8: resynchronization test was successful.

246
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,160
Speaker 8: You're too concerned about protecting Ray, Akari?

247
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,160
Speaker 8: What's the status of the ATOM project?

248
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,820
Speaker 8: Proceeding. It's less than 2% behind schedule.

249
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,900
Speaker 8: Then the Lance of Longinus is...

250
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,860
Speaker 8: Is going according to plan. Ray is handling the operation.

251
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:59,520
We'll be right back.

252
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:22,440
Speaker 17: In other words, hold my hand

253
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,740
Speaker 17: In other words, darling kiss me

254
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,880
Speaker 17: Fill my heart with soul

255
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,700
Speaker 17: And let me sing forevermore

256
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,860
Speaker 17: You are all I love for all I love

257
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,060
Speaker 17: I love you

258
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,780
Speaker 17: Innu de mo, please be true

259
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,320
Speaker 17: Inna de mo, I

260
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,920
love you

261
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,160
Speaker 18: With her friends getting married one after another, Misato starts to feel a little insecure

262
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,280
Speaker 18: Always a bridesmaid, she might just end up spending the rest of her life going to wedding showers and never finding anyone for herself.

263
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,340
Speaker 18: Could a reunion with Kashi be her last chance?

264
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,720
Speaker 18: In the next episode, the old

265
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,500
Speaker 5: biological clock goes tick, tick, tick.
