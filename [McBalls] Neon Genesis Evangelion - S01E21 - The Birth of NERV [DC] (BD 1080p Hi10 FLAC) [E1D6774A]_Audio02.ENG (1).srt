1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,400
Speaker 1: You mean the super solenoid theory that Dr. Katsuragi proposed?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,740
Speaker 1: That theory is outrageous and nothing more than a hypothesis at this

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,040
Speaker 2: point.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,900
Speaker 2: But only

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,160
Speaker 1: the S2 theory can explain that giant's power.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,300
Speaker 1: And we don't actually need to

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,120
Speaker 3: find this to

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,580
Speaker 1: put too much

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,660
Speaker 4: faith in their own ideas.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,800
Speaker 4: When all the data has been verified, then I'll accept it.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,800
Speaker 4: And they become fixated too easily.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:27,900
Speaker 4: After all,

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,740
Speaker 3: they're incapable

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,420
Speaker 1: of accuracy

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,700
Speaker 3: -assessing reality.

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,240
Speaker 5: And those are the people seeking to find the

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,740
Speaker 4: truth of it.

18
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,940
Speaker 4: How is it quite?

19
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,080
Speaker 4: And in fact, they are not so noble.

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,540
Speaker 4: Discovery may be joy, but knowledge is power.

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,720
Speaker 4: All they're doing is trying to benefit themselves.

22
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,700
Speaker 2: Today's experiment is on an ego-friendly order to ignore that field, right?

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,240
Speaker 2: Right.

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,080
Speaker 6: We've got to suppress the surface radiation!

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,500
Speaker 2: It's way over

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,360
Speaker 6: the projected limit!

27
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,680
Speaker 2: It's no good!

28
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,080
Speaker 2: The DNA that was inserted

29
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,980
Speaker 6: into atoms has

30
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,140
Speaker 7: already been physically confused!

31
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,580
Speaker 3: All the heat fields are being released!

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,780
Speaker 1: The conversion system is already set!

33
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Speaker 1: It's sinking in!

34
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,280
Speaker 1: I don't care if it just makes a small difference!

35
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,720
Speaker 1: Keep the damage to an absolute minimum!

36
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,840
Speaker 1: The atomic components are breaking up at the

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,360
Speaker 7: quad level!

38
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,180
Speaker 7: Initiate thermal damage treatment as soon as the dorm cough opens!

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,660
Speaker 7: I don't care if it's only for a tenth of a second!

40
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,360
Speaker 7: The

41
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,200
Speaker 8: conversion system is already being sold.

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,740
Speaker 8: God, how crazy!

43
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,900
Speaker 8: It's spinning its wings! It's breaking towards the sun!

44
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,360
The End

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,960
Speaker 9: Like a cruel天使

46
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,980
Speaker 9: A young man, be a fairy tale

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,580
Speaker 9: The blue wind is now on the door of my heart

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,440
Speaker 9: I'm just looking at you,

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,240
Speaker 9: You are smiling

50
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,220
Speaker 9: I am so happy to touch the touch

51
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,300
Speaker 9: I am so happy to be able to

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,800
Speaker 9: I don't know what you can't know

53
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,400
Speaker 9: I don't know what a smile

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,180
Speaker 9: But I will know that you will find your back

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,260
Speaker 9: The future will be the way to the future

56
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,560
Speaker 9: The endless endless endless endless

57
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,780
Speaker 9: The window from the end will be as soon as

58
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,480
Speaker 9: The hot air is on the hot air

59
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,740
Speaker 9: The memories of your dreams will be

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,820
Speaker 9: This sky will be the shining

61
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,300
Hi! I'm not in right now, so leave your message after the beep. Bye-bye.

62
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Speaker 10: My last assignment. It's red. Just like blood.

63
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 11: Commander Fuyutsuki

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,600
Speaker 12: was abducted?

65
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,000
Speaker 13: That's right. It happened about two hours ago. The Vice Commander was last seen in the 8th District.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,180
Speaker 12: That's inside this installation. What in the hell were you idiots and intelligence doing?

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Speaker 13: Someone inside this organization must have been involved.

68
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,620
Speaker 13: We appreciate your cooperation in this.

69
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,940
Speaker 12: Someone who could outwit Section 2? You don't think--

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,740
Speaker 13: Ryoji Kaji. He's the suspected mastermind behind this plot.

71
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,900
Speaker 12: So that's why you came for me.

72
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,200
Speaker 13: We believe you can help us.

73
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,200
Speaker 13: As your colleagues, we regret the necessity of including the Director of Operations as a suspect.

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,600
Speaker 13: But that is the nature of our profession.

75
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,700
Speaker 11: And of course, considering my relationship with him, it's a natural precaution.

76
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,640
Speaker 13: Yes, your cooperation would be appreciated.

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,740
Speaker 13: It's been a while.

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,220
Speaker 13: Are your invitations always so violent, Chairman

79
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,620
Speaker 4: Gill?

80
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,980
Speaker 4: There are a number of matters we need to discuss outside of Commander Kari's hearing.

81
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,580
Speaker 4: The nature of your procurement was necessary.

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,940
Speaker 4: You haven't changed at all. And how this affects me is inconsequential.

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,060
Speaker 6: The subject in question has already become an active issue.

84
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
Speaker 6: Thus, these measures were inevitable.

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Speaker 6: Please understand our situation.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,060
Speaker 6: Oh, now this is surprising.

87
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,180
Speaker 6: Not the committee, but sailor.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Speaker 5: Creating a new guard is not on our agenda.

89
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,080
Speaker 5: We hope that you will cooperate, Professor

90
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,740
Speaker 6: Fyutski.

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,960
Speaker 6: Professor Fyutski.

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Speaker 5: Hey, Professor!

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Speaker 5: Professor Fyutski!

94
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,960
Speaker 6: Oh, hello, boys.

95
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,840
Speaker 6: Hey, why don't you come down and join us for a beer at the Riverwalk?

96
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,940
Speaker 6: What, again?

97
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,700
Speaker 10: Ryoko and the other girls said they'll come if you come.

98
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,200
Speaker 14: Yeah, and didn't the dean say you shouldn't be so unsociable?

99
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,500
Speaker 14: All right, you guys win.

100
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,440
Speaker 14: It's nice to have a chance to have a drink outside for a change.

101
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,280
Speaker 6: Yeah.

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
Speaker 14: You know, you're a brilliant scientist,

103
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,860
Speaker 14: but you don't place enough value in your relationships with others.

104
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,200
Speaker 14: I'm sorry, sir.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,920
Speaker 14: Somehow I doubt that.

106
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,540
Speaker 14: However, there's a young bioengineering student

107
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,440
Speaker 14: who's just written a very interesting paper.

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Speaker 14: Her name is Ikari.

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
Speaker 14: Have you heard about her before?

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,980
Speaker 6: Ikari? No, sir.

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
Speaker 14: I've told her about your work, and she asked if she could meet you.

112
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,280
Speaker 14: She'll be calling you soon, and I'd like you to take her on as a research assistant.

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
Speaker 14: And her name is Akari?

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,100
Speaker 6: I'll do it, sir.

115
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,760
Speaker 6: I read your paper last night.

116
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,500
Speaker 6: There are a few things I have questions about, but it's really very intriguing.

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,060
Speaker 15: Thank you very much, sir.

118
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,660
Speaker 6: And your full name is Yui Akari, right?

119
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,240
Speaker 15: Yes, sir.

120
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,220
Speaker 6: So, what are your career plans?

121
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,320
Speaker 6: Would you like to go into corporate research or join a school's research facility?

122
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,860
Speaker 15: Well, I haven't really thought about it much.

123
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,100
Speaker 15: And in my case, there may be a third option to be considered.

124
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,140
Speaker 15: I'm thinking about getting married and having children.

125
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,780
Speaker 15: Of course, that's assuming I meet the right person.

126
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,020
Speaker 16: By incorporating the S2 unit into itself, it has achieved its ultimate form.

127
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,380
Speaker 16: Evangelion Unit 1.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,780
Speaker 16: A living God which we created. What blasphemy!

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,720
Speaker 16: The creation of a supreme being is unacceptable.

130
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,220
Speaker 16: Man must not

131
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,220
Speaker 3: create gods.

132
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Speaker 3: No one

133
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,180
Speaker 6: should possess such power.

134
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,800
Speaker 6: Can we

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,460
Speaker 2: trust Gendo Ikari?

136
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,140
Speaker 6: Gendo Rokabungi?

137
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,640
Speaker 6: I've heard the name before.

138
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,740
Speaker 2: No,

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,920
Speaker 6: I've never met him.

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,280
Speaker 6: But he does seem to be at the core of a lot of rumors, rather unsavory rumors at that.

141
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,600
Speaker 6: What?

142
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Speaker 6: I was appointed his advisor.

143
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,280
Speaker 6: Well, I'll

144
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,100
Speaker 5: come bail him out.

145
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,620
Speaker 5: I've been hearing some interesting things about you, Professor.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,460
Speaker 5: I've been wanting to meet you for some time.

147
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,580
Speaker 5: Well, getting drunk and starting a fight isn't the best introduction.

148
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Speaker 5: I didn't have a chance to say anything before they jumped me.

149
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,880
Speaker 5: I'm not used to being like Professor, but I'm quite familiar with hatred.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,660
Speaker 5: Well, your problems are none of my concern.

151
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,560
Speaker 5: And you're exactly the kind of person that I expected Professor Fyutski to be.

152
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,620
Speaker 6: My first impression of him was that he was a rogue bull on a short tether.

153
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,160
Speaker 6: Back then, there were still seasons in this country.

154
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,540
Speaker 6: It was autumn.

155
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,680
Speaker 6: Are you serious?

156
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,680
Speaker 15: Yes, sir.

157
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,640
Speaker 15: I've been dating Gendo Rokobungi a lot.

158
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Speaker 6: When she told me that, I couldn't hide my shock.

159
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,360
Speaker 6: It's rather hard imagining you and him being together.

160
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,880
Speaker 15: He's really very nice.

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,980
Speaker 15: It's just that nobody really knows him quite the way I do.

162
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,880
Speaker 15: You ought to try, sir.

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,780
Speaker 6: In this case, I think that ignorance might be bliss.

164
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,280
Speaker 15: Are you upset that I told him to list you as his counselor?

165
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,140
Speaker 6: Well, I'll admit that he's interesting, but I just don't like him.

166
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,540
Speaker 6: It was generally believed that the real object of Gendo's overtures to Yui was her obvious talent.

167
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,600
Speaker 6: That and the support of the secret organization that was arranging funding for her projects.

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,340
Speaker 6: That organization was called Sele.

169
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,640
Speaker 6: In the year 2000, the second impact occurred.

170
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,640
Speaker 6: In the first year of the 21st century was...

171
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,920
Speaker 6: What can I say?

172
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,700
Speaker 6: It was a time I still find hard to talk about.

173
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,020
Speaker 1: It certainly is hot over here.

174
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,500
Speaker 1: I hear it's going to be over 30 degrees Celsius again today.

175
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,860
Speaker 1: That's not rare for Japan these days.

176
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 1: It's been summer for almost a year now.

177
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,560
Speaker 1: It's rough on these old bones.

178
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,560
Speaker 1: Why don't you move to the ship up coast?

179
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,440
Speaker 1: You mean the next town over?

180
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,100
Speaker 1: Whoa, it stinks of oil.

181
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,820
Speaker 1: I just can't learn to like it.

182
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,940
Speaker 1: Still, I can't believe you set

183
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,560
Speaker 6: up shop in a place like this.

184
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,860
Speaker 6: I had a hell of a time finding you.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Speaker 6: They're short of doctors everywhere.

186
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,640
Speaker 6: It's a mockery.

187
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,360
Speaker 6: But it's better than nothing.

188
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,920
Speaker 6: You mean they're going to Antarctica now?

189
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,300
Speaker 1: That's right.

190
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,260
Speaker 1: The UN's finally commissioned a formal investigation.

191
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,500
Speaker 1: The group conducting it is strictly provisional, of course.

192
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,860
Speaker 1: But I think the world needs you there more than here, Professor Fuyutski.

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,240
Speaker 1: That's former

194
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,180
Speaker 6: professor.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,660
Speaker 1: By the way,

196
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
Speaker 6: this column is blank.

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
Speaker 6: Who recommended me?

198
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,860
Speaker 6: This used to be a continent of ice.

199
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,240
Speaker 6: The entire thing is gone.

200
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,960
Speaker 6: Professor Fuyutski.

201
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,340
Speaker 6: Huh?

202
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,520
Speaker 6: I don't believe it.

203
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,560
Speaker 6: You're alive. I'd heard that you were with the

204
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,140
Speaker 5: Katsuragi research team when the disaster occurred.

205
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,720
Speaker 5: I was, but fortunately I returned to Japan one day before the incident happened.

206
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,740
Speaker 5: Is that so? Mr. Rokabungi,

207
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,120
Speaker 6: you're a

208
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,660
Speaker 3: very...

209
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Speaker 3: Excuse

210
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,900
Speaker 6: me, but that's not my name now.

211
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,100
Speaker 6: A postcard, huh?

212
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,280
Speaker 5: Not a business card?

213
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,520
Speaker 5: Ikari? Gendo Ikari?

214
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,860
Speaker 5: My wife has been asking me to send this to you for a while now.

215
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,700
Speaker 5: She's still quite a fan of yours.

216
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
Speaker 5: Quite an honor, considering.

217
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,720
Speaker 5: So how is Yui doing?

218
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,420
Speaker 5: Why isn't she on this expedition?

219
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,940
Speaker 5: Oh, Yui wanted to come as well,

220
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,040
Speaker 5: but we have a child to consider now.

221
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Speaker 5: There are a lot of ugly rumors

222
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,780
Speaker 5: about this organization you work for,

223
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,600
Speaker 5: Sele, or whatever it's called.

224
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,960
Speaker 5: I don't like the way it bullies the committee.

225
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,920
Speaker 5: I'm afraid that it's necessary.

226
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,780
Speaker 5: An organization can't have too many scruples

227
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,760
Speaker 5: in this day and age.

228
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,519
Speaker 6: It may be true that Second Impact

229
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,260
Speaker 6: changed a lot of things. But if this official investigation team had been composed solely

230
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,620
Speaker 6: of Sele personnel, there would have been trouble, were the rest of us just invited for political

231
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,040
Speaker 6: convenience.

232
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,100
Speaker 12: I hate the darkness. All it does is bring back the most horrible memories.

233
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:11,440
Speaker 17: Who is she? The only survivor of the research team. Her name is Misato Katsuragi.

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
Speaker 17: Katsuragi? You mean Dr. Katsuragi's daughter?

235
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,020
Speaker 17: Yes, but she hasn't said a word in two years.

236
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,420
Speaker 17: How terrible.

237
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,640
Speaker 17: She saw hell firsthand.

238
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,980
Speaker 17: Her physical wounds could be healed,

239
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,040
Speaker 17: but repairing the damage to her mind will take time.

240
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,180
Speaker 17: Indeed.

241
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,680
Speaker 6: The entire

242
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,040
Speaker 17: area

243
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,740
Speaker 6: has been affected.

244
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,040
Speaker 6: Altered atmospheric composition,

245
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,680
Speaker 6: the complete extermination of all life forms down to the micro-organic level,

246
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,620
Speaker 6: traces of an enormous cavern directly below the blast center,

247
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,380
Speaker 6: And then there's this giant of light.

248
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
Speaker 6: This whole incident has mysteries upon mysteries.

249
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,380
Speaker 6: Later, the United Nations will make an official declaration

250
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,300
Speaker 6: that second impact had been caused by a meteor strike on Antarctica.

251
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,940
Speaker 6: For someone who knew what I knew,

252
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,200
Speaker 6: those announcements were obvious fabrications.

253
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,520
Speaker 6: Sele and a man named Kiel were behind the cover-up.

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,240
Speaker 6: It became my goal, my obsession to find the real answers.

255
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,800
Speaker 6: The truth that was being suppressed.

256
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,680
Speaker 6: Even if my former student Yui was involved as well.

257
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,440
Speaker 15: It's been a long time.

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,860
Speaker 6: Yes, it has.

259
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,020
Speaker 6: Why did you conceal the existence of the giant?

260
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,520
Speaker 6: You knew Second Impact was gonna happen, didn't you?

261
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,660
Speaker 6: You could talk all you want to about how it was just luck

262
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,060
Speaker 6: that you returned one day before it occurred.

263
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,100
Speaker 6: But how do you explain the fact

264
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,980
Speaker 6: that you brought back all the expedition's records and findings?

265
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,600
Speaker 6: I know for a fact your personal files contain more than we recovered, Ikari.

266
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,180
Speaker 5: Hm. I'm surprised that these weren't destroyed.

267
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
Speaker 6: Sloppy housework.

268
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,420
Speaker 6: I checked into your estate as well.

269
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,200
Speaker 6: Bringing up a child and educating him is expensive.

270
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,300
Speaker 6: But isn't

271
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,400
Speaker 5: this a bit much for a civil servant?

272
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,540
Speaker 5: Very impressive, Professor Futski.

273
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,820
Speaker 5: Perhaps you should be teaching economics.

274
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,500
Speaker 5: I'm

275
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,840
Speaker 6: going to go public with the real truth about you,

276
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,760
Speaker 6: Sele, Second Impact, and the Dead Sea Scrolls.

277
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,660
Speaker 6: What you've been doing here is completely inexcusable.

278
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,240
Speaker 5: As you wish.

279
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,360
Speaker 5: But first, there's something I'd like to show you.

280
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,420
Speaker 5: How far down will we be going?

281
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,200
Speaker 5: Worried, Montresor? A little bit.

282
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,840
Speaker 5: Oh my god.

283
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,540
Speaker 5: Oh, we didn't make this.

284
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,340
Speaker 5: Although 89% of it was buried,

285
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,160
Speaker 5: something or someone excavated this cavity.

286
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,080
Speaker 5: This was originally a giant sphere?

287
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,400
Speaker 5: Exactly like that underground cavity at the South Pole?

288
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,140
Speaker 5: The data is virtually identical, yes.

289
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,320
Speaker 5: And do you intend to let that tragedy be repeated again?

290
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,540
Speaker 5: Is that it?

291
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,880
Speaker 5: I'll let you determine that for yourself.

292
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,740
Speaker 5: But either way, every resource of the human race will be poured into this Geo front.

293
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,740
Speaker 7: Professor Fiyutski!

294
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
Speaker 6: Dr. Akagi? You're here too?

295
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,920
Speaker 6: Yes.

296
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,420
Speaker 7: This is the ideal place for advancing our research towards creating the ultimate biocomputer system.

297
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,460
Speaker 7: I'm going to name them the Magi.

298
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,360
Speaker 6: The Magi? The Three Wise Men of the East?

299
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,180
Speaker 6: Is this what you wanted to show me?

300
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,320
Speaker 7: No, it's over this way.

301
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,120
Speaker 7: Ritsuko, I'll be right back.

302
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,800
Speaker 6: Unbelievable.

303
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,840
Speaker 6: Is this the Giant of Light?

304
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,600
Speaker 6: No.

305
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,140
Speaker 7: In Gehern, we refer to the second impact giant as Atom.

306
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,660
Speaker 7: But this isn't that one.

307
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,100
Speaker 6: Then, what is this?

308
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,060
Speaker 7: This is what man has created from Atom.

309
00:14:59,720 --> 00:14:59,920
Speaker 7: Ava.

310
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,780
Speaker 5: Ava?

311
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,300
Speaker 5: Project E, the Atom Revival Project.

312
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,720
Speaker 5: And that is Evangelion Unit Zero, our system prototype.

313
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,260
Speaker 5: Prototype? Prototype of what?

314
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,720
Speaker 5: Fyutski, will you join us in creating a new genesis for mankind?

315
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,540
Speaker 8: Uh, ma'am?

316
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,080
Speaker 8: Oh, I'm sorry. I zoned out. Let's proceed with Rey's repeat test.

317
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,200
Speaker 8: I haven't seen

318
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,220
Speaker 11: Major Katsuragi today.

319
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,200
Speaker 8: Neither have

320
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,420
Speaker 11: I.

321
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,180
Speaker 11: Uh, Katsuragi?

322
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,020
Speaker 11: Yeah, Misato Katsuragi. Pleased to meet ya.

323
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,460
Speaker 8: Dear Mother, I have just become acquainted with a girl named Katsuragi.

324
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,300
Speaker 8: Most people tend to keep their distance from me once they find out who I am,

325
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,760
Speaker 8: which forces me to remember how important your name is around here.

326
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Speaker 8: But Misato is different.

327
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,400
Speaker 8: She's very open and honest, even with me.

328
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,440
Speaker 8: I also understand that she's the only survivor from the original research team.

329
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,960
Speaker 8: She used to be mute,

330
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaker 7: but she talks almost constantly now, like she's trying to make up for lost time.

331
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,180
Speaker 7: Dear Ritsuko, I'm underground so much these days that I feel like a mole.

332
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,360
Speaker 7: And I'm getting royally sick and tired of living on the boxed lunches they provide here.

333
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,280
Speaker 7: That should improve, though. Up on the surface, they've started construction on Tokyo 3.

334
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,260
Speaker 8: Misato hasn't shown up at college for the last few days, and I've finally forced her to tell me why.

335
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,500
Speaker 8: Talk about stupid! She spent the whole week having sex with her new boyfriend.

336
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,940
Speaker 8: a whole week.

337
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,460
Speaker 8: I think there's another side to her I haven't seen before,

338
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,640
Speaker 8: and it disturbs me.

339
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Speaker 8: Well, she introduced me to him today,

340
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,440
Speaker 8: and he's handsome all right,

341
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,620
Speaker 8: but his sloppy grooming and attitude really

342
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,240
Speaker 7: bother me.

343
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,080
Speaker 7: You've always been a little boy shy, Ritzko dear.

344
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,300
Speaker 7: I think it's because you only had a mother

345
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,540
Speaker 7: and no men in your life,

346
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,040
Speaker 7: and I'm afraid that I never reeled you in

347
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,360
Speaker 7: as often as I should have.

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,040
Speaker 7: I'm ashamed to admit it,

349
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
Speaker 7: but I've only acted like a mother

350
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 7: when it suited my whims,

351
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,260
Speaker 7: which wasn't often.

352
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,240
Speaker 6: Another day like every other.

353
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,360
Speaker 6: Why does the loss of autumn make me feel so sad?

354
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,880
Speaker 6: You know, if these secret Dead Sea Scrolls that Sele possesses are correct,

355
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,280
Speaker 6: a third impact within the next decade is inevitable.

356
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,800
Speaker 15: But that's why Sele and Geharan exist.

357
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,020
Speaker 15: To prevent that final tragedy.

358
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,040
Speaker 6: It's your ideas that I believe in, not Sele's.

359
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,199
Speaker 15: Because you know that the act of unleashing that seal could be quite dangerous.

360
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
Speaker 6: I've already given Akari the data.

361
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,640
Speaker 6: It's not something one individual can accomplish, after all.

362
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,080
Speaker 6: And there will be no repeat of my earlier stunt.

363
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,700
Speaker 6: I've already received a warning of sorts on that.

364
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
Speaker 6: It would appear that getting rid of me would be quite easy, it seems.

365
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,120
Speaker 15: But that applies to all of us.

366
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,620
Speaker 15: It's so easy.

367
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,080
Speaker 15: to destroy something.

368
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,700
Speaker 6: But there's no reason for you

369
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,940
Speaker 6: to become a test subject.

370
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Speaker 15: I'm simply following the flow

371
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,140
Speaker 15: that's presented itself.

372
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
Speaker 15: That's why I'm at Zele after all.

373
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,020
Speaker 15: For Shinji.

374
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:26,899
Speaker 9: Why

375
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,800
Speaker 3: is there a child in here?

376
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,840
Speaker 6: That's Director Ikari's

377
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,220
Speaker 7: son.

378
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,880
Speaker 6: Ikari, this isn't a daycare center.

379
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,500
Speaker 6: This is an important event.

380
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm sorry, Professor. I'm the one who brought Shiji here.

381
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,600
Speaker 6: But Yui, this is your experiment today.

382
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,660
Speaker 15: That's why I brought him. I want to show him how great the future

383
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,360
will be.

384
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,320
Speaker 7: Those words would prove to be Yui's last.

385
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,380
Speaker 7: A freak accident wiped her from this existence, just as I had hoped it would.

386
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,900
Speaker 7: What a disgusting woman I am.

387
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,180
Speaker 7: But Ritsuko, after that day, Director Akari changed completely.

388
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,720
Speaker 6: Where have you been all week?

389
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,980
Speaker 6: I understand your grief, but you must know that your life no longer belongs to you alone.

390
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,360
Speaker 5: I know.

391
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,560
Speaker 5: Fyutsuki, as of today we will begin the new project.

392
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,600
Speaker 5: I have already made the proposal to Chairman Keele.

393
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,940
Speaker 5: You mean it's approved?

394
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,820
Speaker 5: Yes. That which has never been achieved.

395
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,220
Speaker 5: The path to becoming one with God.

396
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,060
Speaker 5: Human

397
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,120
Speaker 8: instrumentality.

398
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,900
Speaker 8: Dear Mother, congratulations on the completion of your Magi theorems.

399
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,760
Speaker 8: I have good news, too.

400
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,940
Speaker 8: It's been decided that I will officially join Gehearn.

401
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,580
Speaker 8: I'll start working on Project Eden next month.

402
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,480
Speaker 8: Who's

403
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,760
Speaker 1: there?

404
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,580
Speaker 8: Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.

405
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,800
Speaker 8: Technological Development Section.

406
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,940
Speaker 8: Here's my ID.

407
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,480
Speaker 8: I came to see how the new Command Center installation was coming along,

408
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,700
Speaker 8: but I got lost.

409
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,720
Speaker 1: I see. The Commander and Dr. Akagi will see you in the command center.

410
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,940
Speaker 7: Are you alright?

411
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,200
Speaker 1: Yes. I have no

412
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,760
Speaker 5: regrets concerning my work.

413
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,300
Speaker 7: You're lying. You still can't forget about Yui, can you?

414
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Speaker 7: But that's acceptable to me.

415
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,000
Speaker 5: And this is Gehern headquarters.

416
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,300
Speaker 7: Good morning, Director.

417
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,480
Speaker 7: Did you bring your child today?

418
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,420
Speaker 7: Oh, wait. I could have sworn you had a son.

419
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,000
Speaker 5: Oh, no. This isn't Shinji.

420
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,660
Speaker 5: I've decided to take care of an acquaintance's child.

421
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,780
Speaker 5: Her name is Rei Iannami.

422
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,640
Speaker 8: Hello Rei, I'm Ritsuko.

423
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,180
Speaker 8: She resembles someone.

424
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,200
Speaker 7: Yui.

425
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,380
Speaker 7: All the records containing Rei Iannami have been deleted.

426
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,320
Speaker 7: They're all blank. What's going on here?

427
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,260
Speaker 7: Magi Caspar, Magi Balthazar, Magi Malkior.

428
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,060
Speaker 7: The Magi are the three aspects of myself.

429
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,380
Speaker 7: Myself as a scientist, myself as a mother, and myself as a woman.

430
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,600
Speaker 7: Three aspects that combine to make one whole.

431
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,400
Speaker 8: The three faces of Mother.

432
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,500
Speaker 7: And all that's left to do is turn the power on.

433
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,260
Speaker 7: Mm-hmm.

434
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,980
Speaker 7: I'll be leaving early today.

435
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,940
Speaker 7: Misato just got back in town.

436
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,860
Speaker 7: Oh, yes. I'd heard that she'd just joined Gehearn.

437
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,360
Speaker 7: In Germany, if I recall.

438
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,720
Speaker 7: Uh-huh. She's with the third branch now.

439
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,000
Speaker 7: So, she's having a long-distance relationship?

440
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,460
Speaker 7: It didn't work out.

441
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,600
Speaker 7: They broke up, but they always seemed like such a perfect couple.

442
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,800
Speaker 7: The interaction of men and women isn't very logical.

443
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,020
Speaker 7: You're always so cool and analytical about these things.

444
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,160
Speaker 7: Aren't you afraid that you might lose your chance at happiness?

445
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,360
Speaker 8: First, I have to find a definition of happiness.

446
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,320
Speaker 8: It's been a while since I went out.

447
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,300
Speaker 8: Well, have a good one.

448
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,480
Speaker 8: See you later.

449
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,840
Speaker 7: Did you need me for something, Ray?

450
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,820
Speaker 18: I lost my way, Doctor.

451
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,140
Speaker 7: Is that so?

452
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,660
Speaker 7: Well, do you want to come with me then?

453
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,560
Speaker 18: No, thanks.

454
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,940
Speaker 7: But how will you get home all by yourself?

455
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,600
Speaker 18: That's not your business, old hag.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,020
Speaker 18: Old hag?

457
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Speaker 18: I can find my way home by myself, old hag.

458
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,340
Speaker 7: You shouldn't call someone an old hag, Rei.

459
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,260
Speaker 18: But you are an old hag, aren't you?

460
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,600
Speaker 7: I'm getting mad. Commander Akari will spank you for this, you love--

461
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,040
Speaker 7: The commander

462
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,620
Speaker 18: is the one who calls you that.

463
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,040
Speaker 18: He says that old hag is annoying. That old hag is no use anymore.

464
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,840
Speaker 19: Old hag

465
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,040
Speaker 18: is

466
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,800
Speaker 19: no use anymore.

467
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,280
Speaker 19: Old hag is no use anymore.

468
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,500
Speaker 18: - The old hag is no use.

469
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,420
Speaker 18: - The commander's someone that calls you that.

470
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,400
Speaker 19: - He says that old hag is annoying.

471
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,780
Speaker 19: That old hag is no use anymore.

472
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,600
Speaker 7: - You little bitch!

473
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,960
Speaker 7: You're replaceable too, did you know that, Ray?

474
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,400
Speaker 7: You're just as replaceable as me!

475
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,940
Speaker 6: The Instrumentality Committee dissolved the Gohern Research Organization.

476
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,520
Speaker 6: In order to execute the project that Gohern had conceived,

477
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,480
Speaker 6: a new, special organization called NERV was formed.

478
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,060
Speaker 6: All of Gohern's existing personnel were transferred into NERV,

479
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,740
Speaker 6: all except one, the one that had rendered such remarkable service to the Magi system,

480
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,520
Speaker 6: Dr. Akagi.

481
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,240
Speaker 6: Well, I guess it's time to go.

482
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
Speaker 10: *Clears

483
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,400
Speaker 13: Here. Thank you for your cooperation.

484
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,420
Speaker 7: Is it over now?

485
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,580
Speaker 13: Yes, it is. A solution to the problem has been found.

486
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,600
Speaker 15: Where is he?

487
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,980
Speaker 13: I wouldn't know that.

488
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:58,920
Speaker 6: Oh,

489
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,660
Speaker 10: hi. You're a little late, aren't you?

490
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,520
Speaker 12: I'm home.

491
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:26,940
*Gunshot*

492
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,460
Speaker 20: Katsuragi, it's me.

493
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,600
Speaker 20: I'm sure you're listening to this message, especially after

494
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,840
I caused you all so much trouble.

495
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,420
Sorry.

496
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Please tell Ritsu I'm sorry too.

497
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,140
Speaker 20: And there's one more thing to trouble you with.

498
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,100
Speaker 20: I've been growing a certain flower.

499
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,980
Speaker 20: I'd appreciate it if you could water it for me.

500
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,780
Speaker 20: Shinji knows where it is.

501
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Speaker 20: Katsuragi, the truth is with you.

502
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,860
Speaker 20: Don't hesitate.

503
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,380
Speaker 20: Move ahead.

504
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,140
Speaker 20: If I can see you again, I will say...

505
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,500
Speaker 20: the words that I could not say eight years ago.

506
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,740
Speaker 9: Bye.

507
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,820
Speaker 9: This message was recorded at 2.03pm.

508
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,720
Speaker 2: Fool.

509
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
Speaker 2: You were always such a fool.

510
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh, God damn it!

511
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
Speaker 19: All I could do was run.

512
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,800
Speaker 19: Run away from Misato.

513
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,860
Speaker 19: There was nothing I could say.

514
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,020
Speaker 19: I was just a child.

515
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,140
*music*

516
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,840
Thank you.

517
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,960
Speaker 11: The reality of having lost to Shinji has driven Asuka to the depths of despair.

518
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,420
Speaker 11: White Megana's frustration has led to attacks of panic and now mental exhaustion and bouts of paranoia.

519
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,540
Speaker 11: A psychological assault from a new angel delivers a final blow to Asuka's psyche,

520
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,360
Speaker 11: trapping her in a psychological pitfall constructed from her own worst nightmares.

521
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,960
Speaker 11: As the harshness of this new reality continues to tear their worlds apart,

522
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,340
Speaker 11: Shinji is unable to offer her any words of comfort.

523
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,980
Speaker 11: It all happens in the next episode. At least be

524
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,340
Speaker 3: human.

525
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:47,520
.
