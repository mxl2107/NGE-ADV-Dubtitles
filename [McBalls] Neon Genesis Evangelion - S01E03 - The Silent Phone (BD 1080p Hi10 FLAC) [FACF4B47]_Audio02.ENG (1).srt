1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,940
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at it, I'm smiling, you are smiling

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,940
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to touch the things I want to make

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,280
Speaker 1: I'm not sure how many things you know, I'm still not aware of it

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,619
Speaker 1: But I'll see you soon, that's the back of the back of the future.

6
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,080
Speaker 1: The moon will be the way to see the future.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,360
Speaker 1: The cruelest man of the day,

8
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,060
Speaker 1: the window from the end of the day,

9
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,560
Speaker 1: the hot-pastus will be the most popular.

10
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:50,540
If you're a man who

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,500
Speaker 2: Well, let's review it now.

12
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 2: Normally, the EVA runs off electricity provided by an umbilical cable.

13
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,020
Speaker 2: In emergencies, it can switch to a built-in battery with an active life of one minute at full power,

14
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,420
Speaker 2: and no more than five minutes in the minimal activity gain mode.

15
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,240
Speaker 2: This is due to our current limit in battery capacity technology.

16
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,660
Speaker 2: Do you understand?

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,700
Speaker 2: Yes.

18
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,260
Speaker 2: Now let's continue from where we left off yesterday.

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,060
Speaker 2: Initiate induction mode.

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,260
Speaker 2: Position the target in the center, then squeeze the trigger switch on.

21
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,080
Speaker 2: Take it easy. Position the target in the center.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,840
Speaker 2: Next.

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,520
Speaker 3: You know, I can't help but wonder why Shinji agreed to pilot again.

24
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,440
Speaker 3: It seems that he simply does what he's told to do. I suppose that's just his way of getting through life

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,580
Speaker 4: Position target in the Center and pull the switch

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Speaker 4: Position target in the center and pull the switch

27
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,780
Speaker 4: Position target in the center and pull the switch

28
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,000
Speaker 4: Position target in the center and hold the switch position target in the center

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,080
Speaker 5: Miss Misato, it's morning already.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Speaker 5: I just got back from night duty a little while ago.

31
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 5: I don't have to go to work until this evening, so please let me sleep.

32
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,800
Speaker 6: Okay, I'll

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,080
Speaker 5: go.

34
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,740
Speaker 5: Hey, is this okay Thursday?

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,900
Speaker 5: It's burnable trash day.

36
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,460
Speaker 5: Take it to the garbage,

37
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,820
Speaker 7: please.

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,960
Speaker 5: So how's school?

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,020
Speaker 5: Oh, it's okay.

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,960
Speaker 5: Okay, see ya.

41
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,640
Speaker 5: I'll

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,680
Speaker 6: see you later.

43
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,620
Speaker 5: Yes, hello?

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,140
Speaker 5: Oh, it's you, Ritsuko.

45
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,020
Speaker 2: How's it going? Are you getting along with him?

46
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,460
Speaker 5: Him? Oh, Shinji.

47
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,780
Speaker 5: Well, it's been two weeks since he started school,

48
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,660
Speaker 5: and he doesn't seem to have changed.

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,300
Speaker 5: No one ever calls him.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,340
Speaker 2: Calls him where?

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,880
Speaker 5: Well, since I figured he'd be needing one,

52
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,440
Speaker 5: I gave him a cellular phone.

53
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,760
Speaker 5: I don't think he's ever used it, though,

54
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,720
Speaker 5: or received any calls.

55
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,260
Speaker 5: I'm not sure, but I don't think he has any friends.

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,560
Speaker 2: Well, I would guess that Shinji isn't exactly

57
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,440
Speaker 2: the sort of person who makes friends easily.

58
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,060
Mm-hmm.

59
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,800
Speaker 2: Do you know the fable The Hedgehog's Dilemma?

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,940
Speaker 5: Hedgehog?

61
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,580
Speaker 5: You mean those animals with the spiny hair?

62
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,040
Speaker 2: Even though a hedgehog may want to become close with another hedgehog,

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaker 2: the closer they get, the more they injure each other with their spines.

64
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaker 2: It's the same with some humans.

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,960
Speaker 2: The reason he seems so withdrawn is because he's afraid of being hurt.

66
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,500
Speaker 5: Well, he's just going to have to learn someday

67
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,099
Speaker 5: that part of growing up means finding a way to interact with others

68
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,120
Speaker 5: while distancing pain.

69
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Speaker 8: What's up, class rep?

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,180
Speaker 9: Did you deliver the printout I gave you yesterday?

71
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Speaker 8: What?

72
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,440
Speaker 8: Um, well, um, um, well, um, there wasn't anybody home over at Toji's place.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,440
Speaker 8: Mr. Ida, aren't you Suzuhara's friend?

74
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,320
Speaker 8: Aren't you even just a little bit worried about him?

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,660
Speaker 8: You don't suppose he was injured, do you?

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 8: What? You mean in that robot incident?

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,660
Speaker 8: The television reports all said that nobody was injured.

78
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,080
Speaker 8: No way. You saw where the explosion on Mount Takanosu was, didn't you?

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,660
Speaker 8: There were fighters scrambled from Aruma and Komatsu,

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,860
Speaker 8: and there were troops from Isawa and Kyushu.

81
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,200
Speaker 8: I'll bet at least 10 or 20 people were injured.

82
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,260
Speaker 8: And there had to be a few fatalities, too.

83
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,060
Speaker 8: Toji!

84
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,260
Speaker 2: Susahara!

85
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,980
Speaker 8: Where is everyone? Has our entire class disappeared or what?

86
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,220
Speaker 8: They've all either evacuated or they've transferred to other schools.

87
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,700
Speaker 8: No one wants to stay here after that last battle inside the city.

88
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,320
Speaker 8: Yeah, you're probably the only one who's actually enjoying the chance to see a real war.

89
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,360
Speaker 8: That's true.

90
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,940
Speaker 8: And speaking of which, where have you been, Toji?

91
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,420
Speaker 8: Why were you absent so long?

92
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,600
Speaker 8: Did you get involved in the war?

93
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,300
Speaker 10: No, but my little sister did.

94
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 10: She was crushed under a pile of debris.

95
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,880
Speaker 10: She survived, but she's been in the hospital ever since.

96
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,620
Speaker 10: Both my dad and granddad are working at the lab, and there's no way they can leave their posts.

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,140
Speaker 10: So if I'm not with her, she's all alone.

98
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,220
Speaker 8: That robot's pilot was really dumb. It'd make me so angry.

99
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,060
Speaker 8: How could he wreck our own city?

100
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,820
Speaker 8: What did that stupid idiot think he was doing?

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,420
Speaker 8: Speaking of the pilot, have you heard the rumor about the transfer student?

102
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,100
Speaker 8: What transfer student?

103
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,780
Speaker 8: Him over there.

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,660
Speaker 8: He transferred in while you were absent, right after the giant robot incident.

105
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Speaker 8: Don't you think that's a little bit of an odd coincidence?

106
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,520
Speaker 11: He's coming!

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,640
Speaker 11: All rise!

108
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,620
Speaker 12: And so, humankind was about to face its greatest trial.

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,380
Speaker 12: In the last year of the 20th century, the massive meteor from outer space slammed into the continent of Antarctica.

110
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,520
Speaker 12: The continent's ice cap was melted almost instantaneously.

111
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,140
Speaker 12: The water level of the oceans increased dramatically.

112
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,560
Speaker 12: The earth was thrown off its axis,

113
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,520
Speaker 12: and new devastatingly abnormal weather patterns were spawned.

114
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,740
Speaker 12: The lives of all living things on the planet were threatened.

115
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,240
Speaker 12: Several thousand species of flora and fauna,

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,540
Speaker 12: and half of the world's human population were lost in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.

117
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,200
Speaker 7: Huh?

118
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,500
Speaker 12: That was the so-called second impact.

119
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,740
Speaker 12: The survivors still had to live through the hell of worldwide economic collapse,

120
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,880
Speaker 12: ethnic conflicts, and civil wars.

121
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,180
Speaker 12: However, it has been 15 years since then,

122
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,820
Speaker 12: and in only 15 years we have restored ourselves.

123
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,780
Speaker 12: This is certainly proof of the human race's resilience,

124
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,560
Speaker 12: but even more so, it is the fruit of the blood, sweat, and tears

125
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,340
Speaker 12: your father and mothers have dedicated to this cause.

126
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,720
Speaker 12: I lived in Nebukawa.

127
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,920
Speaker 12: Hey, sit down, you guys! We're

128
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,140
Speaker 9: still in class, you know!

129
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,580
Speaker 9: Sit down now!

130
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Speaker 9: You're always so

131
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,520
Speaker 7: bossy!

132
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,080
Speaker 1: Now cut

133
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Speaker 9: that out!

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,580
Speaker 1: Well, you know...

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,140
Speaker 9: Hey, how did you get chosen? Did you have to take

136
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,680
Speaker 6: a test?

137
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 9: Weren't

138
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,160
Speaker 6: you really scared?

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,760
Speaker 6: What's a cockpit look like?

140
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,660
Speaker 6: I'm not supposed to talk about classified stuff like that.

141
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:11,980
Speaker 6: Hey,

142
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,360
Speaker 5: what's the name of that robot?

143
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,220
Speaker 5: I don't

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,000
Speaker 6: know much, but everyone calls it Ava or

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,040
Speaker 5: Unit 1.

146
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,360
Speaker 5: What's its ultimate attack mode?

147
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,020
Speaker 6: Some kind of vibrating knife.

148
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,440
Speaker 6: An ultrasonic

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,840
Speaker 5: wave.

150
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,280
Speaker 5: That's amazing. We are so

151
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,120
Speaker 2: proud of you.

152
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,700
Speaker 12: And thus...

153
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,320
Speaker 9: Oh,

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Speaker 12: that's all for the day.

155
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,260
Speaker 9: Ikari, where do you live?

156
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,800
Speaker 9: In the outer part of the city?

157
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,760
Speaker 9: Everybody stand up!

158
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,640
Speaker 9: Belle!

159
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,840
Speaker 9: Hey, you guys, can't you at least show some manners?

160
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,980
Speaker 10: - Sorry, newcomer, but I had to clobber you.

161
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,660
Speaker 10: I had to pop you one to work off my own anger.

162
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,340
Speaker 8: - He's mean, huh?

163
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,540
Speaker 8: His little sister was injured the last time

164
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,000
Speaker 8: you and your robot fought a battle.

165
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,240
Speaker 8: Well, that's his excuse anyway.

166
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,220
Speaker 8: - I didn't have a choice.

167
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,600
Speaker 8: They made me pilot the stupid thing.

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,540
Speaker 7: Uh-uh.

169
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,320
Speaker 7: Ah!

170
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,540
Speaker 13: There's an emergency.

171
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,040
Speaker 13: I'll report in first.

172
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,160
Speaker 13: Huh?

173
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,900
Speaker 2: A special state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chuga regions surrounding the Tokai district.

174
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,560
Speaker 1: All residents must

175
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,060
Speaker 5: evacuate to their designated

176
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,080
Speaker 1: shelters immediately.

177
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,100
The End

178
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,680
Speaker 14: Our cameras have sighted the target. It's penetrated our territorial waters.

179
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,320
Speaker 14: Assume battle stations. Level 1.

180
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,700
Speaker 5: Roger! Prepare for anti-aircraft interception.

181
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,520
Speaker 14: Tokyo 3, transforming to battle formation.

185
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,080

186
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,980

187
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,940
Speaker 14: We've received reports that civilian evacuation has been completed.

188
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,300

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,200
Speaker 7: Please form groups with your individual classes.

191
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,300
Speaker 8: Not again!

192
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,140
Speaker 8: Just text messages again?

193
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,300
Speaker 8: It's no censorship.

194
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,260
Speaker 8: The government won't let them show any of the battle to us civilians,

195
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,840
Speaker 8: even though it's an incredible historic event.

196
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,640
Speaker 16: The fourth angel would show up while Commander Ikari is away.

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
Speaker 16: It's a lot sooner than we expected.

198
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,720
Speaker 2: The last time they gave us 15 years.

199
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,320
Speaker 2: This time around, the break's only been three weeks.

200
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,560
Speaker 16: They never care about our situation, do they?

201
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,780
Speaker 16: They're the kind we

202
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,980
Speaker 5: women hate the most.

203
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,060
Speaker 14: It's a waste of the taxpayers' money.

204
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,500
Speaker 14: The committee is demanding that we dispatch an Evangelion again.

205
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,900
Speaker 15: They're more obnoxious than the aliens.

206
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,180
Speaker 15: I'd have mobilized even if they hadn't asked.

207
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,320
Speaker 6: Entry procedure initiated.

208
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,240

209
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,580
-

210
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,220
-

211
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,160
-

212
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,480
Speaker 8: -

213
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Speaker 8: - Hey, I need to talk to you privately for a second.

214
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Speaker 8: - Who want four? - Come on, please.

215
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,880
Speaker 8: - Oh, alright.

216
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,940
Speaker 8: - Hey, class rep! - Now what?

217
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,880
Speaker 8: - We've both gotta go to the bathroom.

218
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,000
Speaker 9: - You were supposed to do that before you came here.

219
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,920
Speaker 10: So what's this all about?

220
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,060
Speaker 9: I've got to

221
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,680
Speaker 8: see it at least once in my life.

222
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,360
Speaker 10: You mean the battle up there?

223
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,140
Speaker 8: Nobody knows when the enemy will come the next time.

224
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
Speaker 8: Kensuke, are you serious?

225
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,420
Speaker 8: If we let this opportunity escape us, we may lose it forever.

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,340
Speaker 8: Please help me unlock the gate.

227
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,200
Speaker 8: But you can get killed

228
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Speaker 10: if you go out there.

229
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,760
Speaker 8: If we stay here in the shelter, who's to say that the risk isn't the same?

230
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,120
Speaker 8: If I might be killed anyway, I'd rather see it first.

231
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:24,900
Speaker 10: You idiot.

232
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,720
Speaker 8: What do you think nerves for?

233
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,600
Speaker 8: And what is Nerve's most important weapon?

234
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,960
Speaker 8: It's the robot that new kid pilots.

235
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,660
Speaker 8: He protected us the other day, but you hit him pretty hard.

236
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,300
Speaker 8: Twice.

237
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,300
Speaker 8: If he refuses to fight, we're all going to die.

238
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,500
Speaker 8: Doesn't that make it your obligation to watch him fight?

239
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,700
Speaker 8: Okay, you're not leaving me any options.

240
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:47,860
Speaker 8: You'll do

241
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,520
Speaker 10: just about anything to get what you want, won't you?

242
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,440
Speaker 5: Shinji, are you ready?

243
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,380
Speaker 2: First, neutralize the enemy's AT field, then fire a volley.

244
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,120
Speaker 2: Do it just like we practiced.

245
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,940
Speaker 2: Can you handle

246
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,100
Speaker 3: that?

247
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,440
Launch, Eva!

248
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,740
Speaker 7: - Cool, all my efforts really paid off.

249
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,960
Speaker 8: I've been waiting for this moment all my

250
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,500
Speaker 7: life.

251
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,060
Speaker 7: *BANG*

252
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,100
Speaker 7: *BANG*

253
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,660
*BANG*

254
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,700
*BANG*

255
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,600
Speaker 7: - OHH! - THERE

256
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Speaker 6: IT IS!

257
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,260
Speaker 6: - The AT field has been unfolded.

258
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,760
Speaker 6: - Do it just like we planned, okay Shinji?

259
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,100
Speaker 1: - Okay!

260
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,020
*BANG*

261
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,560
*BANG*

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
Speaker 9: - Idiot! You hit the enemy with your own smoke!

263
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,940
Speaker 8: *Sigh

264
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,820
Speaker 7: *

265
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,360
Speaker 7: Help!

266
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,520
Speaker 14: The umbilical cable's been snapped off!

267
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,000
Speaker 8: Ava

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,420
Speaker 3: has switched to its internal battery

269
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,160
Speaker 8: power source!

270
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,760
Four minutes, fifty-three seconds of activation remaining!

271
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,400
Speaker 7: It's coming this way!

272
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,079
Speaker 5: Shinji!

273
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,380
Speaker 5: Are you all right?

274
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,579
Speaker 5: Shinji!

275
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,220
Speaker 5: Damage report!

276
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,660
Speaker 5: No problem, Detective!

277
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,780
Speaker 5: He can make it!

278
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:15,860
Speaker 5: - Huh?

279
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,060
Speaker 5: - Those are Shinji's classmates.

280
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:26,760
Speaker 5: - What

281
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,600
Speaker 8: are they doing there?

282
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,540
Speaker 8: - Why isn't he fighting back?

283
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,000
Speaker 8: - Maybe he can't move because we're down here.

284
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,600
Speaker 8: - He can't because of us!

285
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,700
Speaker 3: - Activation time remaining three minutes,

286
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,540
Speaker 8: 28 seconds.

287
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,480
Speaker 3: - Shinji,

288
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,260
Speaker 5: let them

289
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,040
Speaker 3: into the cockpit!

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,520
Speaker 9: - Once you've got them, make a temporary retreat.

291
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,120
Speaker 9: We'll start again later.

292
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,080
Speaker 2: - What makes you think that unauthorized civilians

293
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,000
Speaker 2: can be allowed into the entry plug?

294
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,160
Speaker 9: - I'm authorizing it.

295
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,820
Speaker 9: - You're exceeding your authority, Captain.

296
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,440
Speaker 9: - Unit one's remaining activation time, three minutes.

297
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,960
Speaker 9: Shinji, hold Ava on your current commands and inject the

298
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,520
Speaker 16: entry plug.

299
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,560
Speaker 16: Hurry up and do it!

300
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,480
Speaker 1: - -

301
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,000
Speaker 8: - What

302
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 8: the--? - This water! My camera!

303
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,840
Speaker 8: My camera!

304
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,460
Speaker 6: Abnormal conditions

305
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,180
Speaker 6: occurring in the nervous system! Of

306
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,480
Speaker 2: course!

307
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,660
Speaker 2: You've allowed two foreign bodies into the Matrix! Their noise in

308
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,700
Speaker 2: the nerve impulse system!

309
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,520
AAAAAAAH!

310
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:47,740
Retreat! Get out of there!

311
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,880
Speaker 9: Utilize recovery route 34. Retreat to the deep side of the mountain!

312
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,060
Speaker 7: Hey,

313
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,980
Speaker 9: Nukid! She

314
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,260
Speaker 6: said retreat! Nukid!

315
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,940
Speaker 6: I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

316
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,960
Speaker 6: I mustn't run away!

317
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,380
Speaker 9: The progressive knight's been engaged!

318
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,040
Speaker 9: Obey my order, Shinji! You've got to retreat!

319
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,300
Speaker 9: Shinji!

320
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,480
Speaker 7: NOOOOOO!

321
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,420
Speaker 9: That idiot!

322
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,900
Speaker 3: Unit 1, activation time remaining 30 seconds!

323
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,420
Speaker 3: 28!

324
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,860
Speaker 3: 27!

325
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,500
Speaker 7: 14!

326
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,700
Speaker 7: 13!

327
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:48,900
Speaker 7: 12!

328
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,000
Speaker 7: 11!

329
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,200
Speaker 7: 10!

330
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,460
Speaker 7: 9!

331
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,480
Speaker 7: 8!

332
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,680
Speaker 7: 7!

333
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,880
Speaker 7: 6!

334
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,020
Speaker 7: 5!

335
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,040
Speaker 7: 4!

336
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:58,960
Speaker 7: 3!

337
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,080
2!

338
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,100
1!

339
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,920
Speaker 3: AVA Unit 1 is a good one!

340
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,380
Speaker 3: Activation ceased.

341
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,400
Speaker 2: The target is completely silent.

342
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,580
Speaker 2: -

343
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,380
Speaker 10: It's been three days.

344
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,200
Speaker 10: You

345
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,900
Speaker 8: mean since we were chewed out?

346
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,960
Speaker 8: No, since he stopped coming to school.

347
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,280
Speaker 8: Who's he?

348
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,700
Speaker 8: The new kid. Who else would I mean?

349
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,260
Speaker 8: I wonder what he's been doing since then.

350
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
Speaker 8: Are you worried about him?

351
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,300
Speaker 8: No, not exactly worried.

352
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,640
Speaker 8: Toji, for someone who's so blunt and tactless, you're pretty stubborn.

353
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,720
Speaker 8: If you had apologized to him back then, you wouldn't have had to agonize over it for three days.

354
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,960
Speaker 8: Here, this is the new kid's phone number. Take it.

355
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,800
Speaker 8: If you're so worried, why don't you call him?

356
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,980
*music*

357
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,700
Speaker 17: Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars

358
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,760
Speaker 17: Let me see what's playing, it's like on Jupiter and Mars

359
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,920
Speaker 17: In other words, hold my hand

360
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,900
Speaker 17: In other words, darling, kiss me

361
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,820
Speaker 17: Fill my heart with song, oh, let me sing forevermore

362
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,660
Speaker 17: You are all I long for, all I worship and adore

363
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,920
Speaker 17: In other words, please be true.

364
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,580
Speaker 17: In other words,

365
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,360
I love you.

366
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,740
Speaker 11: Overwhelmed and unable to cope with his weaknesses, Shinji attempts to run away.

367
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,000
Speaker 11: Quickly retrieved by the organization, he finds himself surrounded by unsympathetic ears.

368
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,760
Speaker 11: And the only overtures of friendship come from his two classmates.

369
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,480
Speaker 11: It happens in the next episode, where I'll be doling out another helping of fan service.
