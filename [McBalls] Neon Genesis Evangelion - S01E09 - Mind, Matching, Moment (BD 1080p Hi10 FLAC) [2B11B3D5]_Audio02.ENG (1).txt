Speaker 1
Like a poor man, You're a young man, You're a fairy tale. The blue wind is now Even if you're a door, you're smiling I'm so happy that you're looking for a moment I'm still wondering if you're not sure 痛いけな瞳 だけどいつか気づくでしょう その背中には 遥か未来目指すための羽があること 残酷な天使のテゼ 窓辺からやがて飛び立つ Hottobashiru atui pattosude Omoyde wo uragiru nara Kono sora wo daite kagayaku Shounenmu yoshi uwa ni nare

Speaker 2
Hey, have you seen her yet?

Speaker 3
Oh yeah! Yeah!

Speaker 2
Seen what? You dork! You

Speaker 3
haven't seen the overseas student yet?

Speaker 2
The overseas student? A foreigner? Yeah!

Speaker 3
She's in the 8th grade, Class A! She just transferred here!

Speaker 2
Oh,

Speaker 4
she's hot! Her name's Asuka Langley Soryu. Did you know that? Yeah, she's just cute.

Speaker 5
Since she was raised over there but born here, do you think she'll already have a boyfriend?

Speaker 4
No, no, no.

Speaker 6
I

Speaker 4
bet

Speaker 5
she broke up in Germany

Speaker 4
and she's here in a foreign land with a heart that can't be mended. All right.

Speaker 6
My gosh. Did you hear all that gossip? Asuka, Asuka, Asuka.

Speaker 2
They're totally clueless.

Speaker 6
Thanks. Come again.

Speaker 2
At least your pictures don't reveal her personality.

Speaker 5
Hello. Guten Morgen. - Good Shinji! - G-Guten

Speaker 7
Morgan. - Hey,

Speaker 8
why so

Speaker 5
gloomy? I'm the most popular girl in school. You should appreciate your good fortune. - Gah! - Hey, the other one's here too, isn't she? - Other one? - What are you stupid? I'm talking about the first child, of course.

Speaker 1
- Oh, Ayanami.

Speaker 5
- Hm? Hello! You must be Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the prototype. I'm Asuka! Asuka Langley Soryu! I'm the designated pilot of Ava 2. Let's be good friends! What for? Because it would be convenient! You know what I mean! If I'm ordered to, I will do it. Freakazoid.

Speaker 2
It takes one to know one. I wonder if only weirdos are chosen to be Eva pilots.

Speaker 4
Oh! You've lost some weight. You're enduring an unrequited love.

Speaker 9
Really? You're so very sure, are you?

Speaker 4
A woman with a mole like a tear on her cheek is destined to a life full of heartache and sorrow.

Speaker 9
If you're trying to put the moves on me, I'm afraid you can't. Not while that face is pressed against the

Speaker 4
glass anyway.

Speaker 10
It's been quite a while, Kashi.

Speaker 4
It's been a while, all right.

Speaker 10
You know, you're not as discreet as I remember you. He ain't never been discreet in his life. You finished handing over Unit 2, haven't you? What are you still doing here?

Speaker 4
I received orders this morning that I'll be staying around so, Gorgeous, we can hang around again.

Speaker 10
Just like we used to. Don't flatter yourself. Enemy attack?

Speaker 11
We've just received this report from the battlecruiser Haruna. Have detected huge submerged object off the Kyi Peninsula.

Speaker 1
Sending data.

Speaker 11
Got it. The data has been analyzed. The wavelength pattern confirms it. It's an angel. All personnel, go to first stage alert. 50

Speaker 10
% The recent battle has severely damaged Tokyo 3's intercept system. Only 26% of our defense capability has been restored. In addition, our operational capability for actual combat is virtually nil. Therefore, we're going to have to intercept the target at the water's edge right before it makes land. Units 1 and 2 will mount a coordinated attack in a series of waves. In other words, close in and take turns. Roger! This

Speaker 5
sucks! My first fight over Japan and she won't let me handle it solo! Why do I have to bring you?

Speaker 1
SOP! That's just procedures, you know! Well, let

Speaker 5
me tell you something first, third child! Just don't get in my way! Hmm, his selection as a pilot must have been a joke, right? *BANG*

Speaker 7
Beginning attack!

Speaker 5
I'll handle this angel! Cover my back, Shinji! C-Cover you? Yeah! Ladies first! Dammit! Don't you talk to me like that, you dumb rookie!

Speaker 7
In charge! What?

Speaker 12
*Squeak *BANG

Speaker 8
* This is all your fault! You totally screwed up my debut battle!

Speaker 5
What are you talking about? You're the one who charged in there acting like an idiot. Idiot?

Speaker 8
How dare you call me that, you pathetic excuse for a combat pilot! You're just a jerk! Me?

Speaker 3
You were in such a rush to show off, you disregarded procedure.

Speaker 5
What was that? You look like a drowned rat! You can't say that

Speaker 12
kind of thing to me! Nerve abandoning operation and transferred command to UN Secondary Force.

Speaker 11
We've been completely humiliated.

Speaker 12
At 11:05 AM, the UN forces made an attack with an in-tomb mine.

Speaker 11
We'll have to redraw the map again. They

Speaker 12
succeeded in burning off 28% of the target's structural substance.

Speaker 5
Well, it kinda looks dead.

Speaker 11
This is merely temporary. The second attack is just a matter of time. Well, at least

Speaker 4
we've got time to regroup, and you can't ask for more than that. Alright,

Speaker 11
you two. Just what do you think your job is?

Speaker 5
Piloting Ava? Wrong!

Speaker 11
It's to beat the Angels! Nerve does not exist to make grotesque public spectacles like this. Therefore, the two of you will learn to work together.

Speaker 5
Why should we?

Speaker 11
Enough.

Speaker 5
Why does everyone get so angry here?

Speaker 4
Adults have a thing about credibility.

Speaker 5
Um, where's

Speaker 9
Misato?

Speaker 4
Clearing things up. It's the duty of the person in charge to take responsibility for anything that goes wrong.

Speaker 9
Oh, look what we have here. Here are the protests and damage reports from all of the bureaus concerned. This is a bill from the UN, and you've got a complaint from public relations as well. I hope you have fun reading them all.

Speaker 10
I already know what they say. If you're going to fight, please don't do it here, right? I'd say that was a good guess. I'll do it after we kill this angel. I will destroy it. That would be a nice start. I think you should know that Commander Foyutsuki isn't exactly happy with this whole situation. I'm afraid you could be busted back to lieutenant or even lower. I guess it was just good luck within bad luck that Commander Ikari wasn't here. If he'd been here, you'd have already been fired. So you've brought me some ideas to help save my job, haven't you, dear friend? Like this one? Ah, I thank you, Dr. Ritsugu Akagi. It's good to have a friend you can count on. That's nice. But I'm not the one who'll be saving your backside this time. This is Mr. Kaji's idea. Kaji? Hmm. Hmm.

Speaker 1
I'm home! Not that anyone's here, of course, but... WHAT?! What is this?!

Speaker 5
Don't be so

Speaker 1
rude! These are my personal belongings! You?! Wh-but-but

Speaker 5
what in the

Speaker 7
blazes are you doing in my house?! Why

Speaker 5
are you still here?

Speaker 7
Still here?!

Speaker 5
Don't Hmm, yeah, you've been dumped for the new model.

Speaker 7
Huh?! Misato will be living with

Speaker 5
me. Of course, that's a much more logical choice when you consider my superior abilities. Although honestly, I'd rather live with Kaji. Say, just why our Japanese houses so small anyway? I couldn't even get half my stuff in my new room!

Speaker 1
And Japanese sure

Speaker 5
don't have any sense of privacy. How can they live in a

Speaker 10
room without locks? Unbelievable!

Speaker 5
It's weird. The Japanese way is to consider

Speaker 10
the needs of others before one's own.

Speaker 5
Misawa!

Speaker 10
How's it going? You two are going to get along real well.

Speaker 7
- What? - Just what do you mean?

Speaker 10
- This is part of your new training. - Say what? - There is only one way to destroy the seventh angel. Execute a simultaneous two point attack on each target's core while the angel is separated. In other words, an attack on both halves by two Avas with perfectly synchronized timing. Coordination between the two of you will be vital to the success of the mission. To that end, I want the two of you to live together from now on. No way! A boy and a girl should never sleep under one roof after the age of seven! The angel is currently regenerating itself. It will begin its second assault in six

Speaker 8
days. But it's impossible.

Speaker 10
We have a way of making it possible. The master attack pattern will be choreographed using this music. If you follow

Speaker 7
it

Speaker 10
exactly, you will be able to work in sync and completely destroy both targets. We begin now.

Speaker 7
We attack in six days.

Speaker 10
Hmph!

Speaker 12
- Coming.

Speaker 6
- You betrayed us. You're dressing alike again too. - I can't believe this.

Speaker 7
- Neither can we.

Speaker 6
It's all Misada's fault. We have to eat, breathe, and sleep together.

Speaker 7
- You're living in sin,

Speaker 8
that's

Speaker 7
awful. - No, it's not like that. - Just

Speaker 8
what is it like? - Hi everybody.

Speaker 2
- Huh? - Um, would you like to explain all of this to us? - Geez, Shinji, you should've told us about that part first. - So how

Speaker 10
are their coordination drills coming along, Miss Misato? - Not very well, as you can see. - Scheisse! - You will so

Speaker 5
much for synchronization, I can never sink down the pathetic level this animated turnip

Speaker 8
lives at. If you ask me,

Speaker 5
the whole idea

Speaker 8
is impossible.

Speaker 5
- Then you're giving up. But you don't have anyone else, do you? - Rei? - Yes, ma'am. Why

Speaker 10
don't you try? Yes, ma'am. Well, it looks like I should alter the operation to pair Shinji and Rei. What?

Speaker 13
No. No! No, I can't stand this! I can't take it anymore! Wait, Asuka!

Speaker 2
So even the devil can cry.

Speaker 13
Uuuh! Shinji-kou! Go apologize! Huh? You made her cry, you jerk! Go find her and tell her you're sorry!

Speaker 5
Um... Don't say anything. I know. I have to pilot the Eva. I've got no choice. I'll do it. No matter what, I'll put Ray and Misato to shame! But still, you don't have to squash them. You're being too simplistic, even if you are a male. I must avenge myself. My pride. It's a matter of honor now. Can't you understand that? Where's Misato? At work.

Speaker 3
She called earlier. She'll be there all night.

Speaker 5
So, that means we're all alone tonight, huh? This is the impenetrable wall of Jericho, third child. What? Take one step over this wall and you'll be a dead man. And now it's time to go to bed, children. Ugh!

Speaker 8
Why do Japanese sleep on the floor? This is so stupid!

Speaker 7
*Gunshot* Oh, my God. Oh, no.

Speaker 10
You're just a child yourself. No, somebody might see us.

Speaker 4
Who's watching?

Speaker 10
Somebody-- Forget it, Kashi. There's nothing between us anymore. Don't ever do that again.

Speaker 4
But your lips didn't say no. Tell me, which one should I trust? Your lips or your words?

Speaker 9
Oh, thanks. Well, looks like you've got troubles.

Speaker 10
Hmm? Yeah, a few. So,

Speaker 9
is it work, or a man, or both?

Speaker 10
A lot of things.

Speaker 9
Hmm.

Speaker 10
Still in love, huh? Don't be ridiculous! Get real. Who'd want that idiot? I may have been just a kid, but getting involved with him was still the stupidest and most idiotic thing I've ever done in my entire life. I meant that he may still like you. Did I scare you? I'll

Speaker 9
show you scary. You're only proving my hypothesis. Why don't you just go with your feelings, Misato? It's not like it's still eight years ago, you know. Nothing's changed.

Speaker 10
Not a bit. He's still immature. I've got to get to work. Tomorrow's D-Day, you know.

Speaker 6
The target has broken through the final defense line at Gora.

Speaker 10
Here it comes. We won't fail this time. Spread your AT fields as soon as the music starts. Then

Speaker 5
follow the operation choreography. Are you two ready? Roger!

Speaker 2
The target has entered the mountains.

Speaker 5
Just remember the moves, Shinji. Full power, maximum performance. I know that. We'll be finished in 62 seconds.

Speaker 2
It's coming. Target entering ground zero.

Speaker 10
Detach external power. Ava, launch.

Speaker 12
*Squeak* Huh? Both Avas are okay. Ah, jeez! Pathetic.

Speaker 7
*Scream*

Speaker 5
What are you doing on my Unit 2?! What are you talking about? You're the one who fell on me! You're the one who lost time first! Doom Cop! You're always so slow! What were you doing staying up so late last night?

Speaker 3
Image training for

Speaker 10
today's battle! Oh,

Speaker 5
image training? I just bet! Liar! I know you

Speaker 7
tried to kiss me while I

Speaker 5
was sleeping! You cheat! You were awake! Oh my gosh! I was just kidding! Did you really kiss me? Oh!

Speaker 3
No! No! No! I didn't! I stopped!

Speaker 5
Haventimate! I

Speaker 3
can't

Speaker 5
believe it! Is you calling for your mother in

your sleep and sleepwalking that caused her? What kind of person?

Speaker 11
Those darn kids are embarrassing us again. Yeah.

Speaker 7
Now, darling kiss

me Feel my heart's weak soul

And let it sit forevermore

You are all I know

For all I want is at the door

And now I want

Let me do

In the world

I love you

I love you

Speaker 14
When an unhatched angel is discovered in the caldera of the Osama volcano, especially equipped Ava must descend into the fires of hell itself to do battle. Don't miss the next exciting episode, Magma Diver. And don't worry, there'll be lots of fan service too.
