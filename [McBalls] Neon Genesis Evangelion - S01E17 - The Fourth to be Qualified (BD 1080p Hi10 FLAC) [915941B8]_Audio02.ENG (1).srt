1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,580
Speaker 1: As a poor man,

2
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,400
Speaker 1: This is the end of my mind.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,360
Speaker 1: I hope you enjoyed the future.

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,220
Speaker 2: Major Katsuragi, do you still refuse to allow us to question the only person who was directly involved in this incident, the pilot of Unit 1?

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,820
Speaker 3: Yes, sir. It is my belief that he is still very unstable emotionally, and that bringing him here into this situation would be very unwise at the current time.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,900
Speaker 4: Then, as his proxy, let us ask you, Major Katsuragi.

7
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,260
Speaker 5: Did the Angels attempt communication with a human being?

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,980
Speaker 5: After

9
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,000
Speaker 3: reading the subject's reports, I found no concrete evidence to validate that theory.

10
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,460
Speaker 3: In all likelihood, this irregularity is simply an odd coincidence.

11
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
Speaker 6: If the subject's memory is correct.

12
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,000
Speaker 3: There was no evidence that his memory had been tampered with.

13
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,980
Speaker 6: But the Ava's AC recorder was not functioning. There is no way to confirm it.

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,900
Speaker 6: Was the Angel interested in the human mind?

15
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,740
Speaker 3: I am unable to answer that question.

16
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,120
Speaker 3: Whether the Angels even have a concept of what the human mind is,

17
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Speaker 3: or whether they can understand our thought patterns is completely unknown.

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,840
Speaker 6: A new factor has been revealed in this incident.

19
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,680
Speaker 6: in that the Angel tried to take Ava into itself.

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,780
Speaker 6: Is there any possibility that this

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,880
Speaker 5: aspect may be linked to the predicted 13th Angel and all Angels thereafter?

22
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,220
Speaker 3: Based on the previous patterns we have observed, there would appear to be no systematic organization among the Angels.

23
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,200
Speaker 3: Correct. They have worked independently thus far.

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,460
Speaker 3: What do you mean, sir?

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,580
Speaker 2: You may not ask questions.

26
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,220
Speaker 3: Understood.

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,380
Speaker 2: That will be all. Dismissed.

28
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:48,860
Speaker 3: Yes, sir.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,520
Speaker 2: Well, what do you

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,540
Speaker 7: think, Ikari?

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,780
Speaker 7: The Angels appear to be getting more intelligent. There's not much time left.

32
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 7: Left

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,100
Speaker 2: for us, you mean.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Speaker 8: Who's the patient in room 12?

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,240
Speaker 4: That's the emergency room patient from the first Ava incident. She's been here for a long time.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Speaker 4: Her injuries are really complicated.

37
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,360
Speaker 4: Poor girl. And she's still in elementary school.

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Speaker 9: He's here again today?

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,420
Speaker 9: Yeah. He comes to see her at least twice a week.

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,560
Speaker 9: He's a good brother. Thinking about his sister like that...

41
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,600
Speaker 9: Yeah, boys like that are pretty rare.

42
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,700
Speaker 7: Ray, are things satisfactory?

43
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,060
Speaker 3: Yes. I will be with Dr. Akagi all day tomorrow.

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,280
Speaker 3: And the day after that, I will be in school.

45
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,700
Speaker 7: And how is school?

46
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,400
Speaker 3: No problem, sir.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,440
Speaker 7: I see. That's good.

48
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,160
Speaker 9: Class attention!

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,440
Speaker 9: Okay, sit down.

50
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,360
Speaker 2: Well, Ayanami is absent as usual.

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
Speaker 2: and so's Mr. Ida.

52
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,100
Speaker 2: Hey,

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 3: what's up with Kinsuke?

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
Speaker 2: He's in New Yokosuka

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
Speaker 2: to see some dumb battleship.

56
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,440
Speaker 2: Ship called Miyoko or something like that

57
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,220
Speaker 2: is in port.

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,520
Speaker 2: Mr. Suzuhara!

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,220
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, sir!

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Speaker 2: Will you deliver this document to Miss Ayanami

61
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,100
Speaker 2: after school?

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,900
Speaker 10: Yes, sir!

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,900
Speaker 11: The first branch is still okay?

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,480
Speaker 11: No, no, don't bother.

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,700
Speaker 11: The data from the recon set is still being confirmed

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,400
Speaker 11: by the Magi.

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Speaker 11: Right.

68
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,739
Speaker 12: It disappeared.

69
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,320
Speaker 12: The entire second branch just vanished?

70
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,320
Speaker 12: Yes, sir.

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,620
Speaker 13: It's been confirmed.

72
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,320
Speaker 13: It's been wiped off the map.

73
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,480
Speaker 13: Oh my god.

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,820
Speaker 12: That second insect had gone crazy.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,780
Speaker 12: General affairs is total chaos.

76
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,700
Speaker 8: What do you think happened over there?

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Speaker 8: It's under investigation.

78
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,560
Speaker 8: Our only clues are these recon photos

79
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,000
Speaker 8: from the geosynchronous satellite.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:43,880
Speaker 8: There's

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,280
Speaker 14: nothing else

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,700
Speaker 8: left.

83
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,740
Speaker 8: 10 seconds.

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Speaker 8: Nine,

85
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,180
Speaker 15: eight, seven, six, five, four, three,

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,200
Speaker 15: 3, 2, 1, contact.

87
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,840
Speaker 15: This is horrible.

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,920
Speaker 15: Evangelion Unit 4, its support group, and all the other facilities within an 89 kilometer radius were completely destroyed.

89
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,780
Speaker 15: Along with thousands of people.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,680
Speaker 13: Looking at the time schedule, it would appear that they were in the middle of installing the experimental S-2 unit from Germany.

91
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,100
Speaker 15: Potential causes range from an insufficient structural integrity to an error in calculation during the preliminary design stage.

92
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,840
Speaker 15: That's 32,768 possibilities.

93
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,840
Speaker 15: And that's not mentioning

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,700
Speaker 8: sabotage.

95
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,540
Speaker 5: But it wasn't really an explosion, was it?

96
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,260
Speaker 5: It just disappeared.

97
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,200
Speaker 8: In all probability, they were swallowed by a Dirac-C, just as Unit 1 was.

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,440
Speaker 8: Then the restored S-2 engine is...

99
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:42,920
Speaker 8: Gone.

100
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,740
Speaker 8: Along with our hopes.

101
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,020
Speaker 8: We're being forced to use things we don't understand.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,200
Speaker 8: Yes.

103
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,820
Speaker 8: Things like the Avis.

104
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,520
Speaker 8: So what'll we do with Unit 3?

105
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,620
Speaker 8: It's being shipped here as we speak.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Speaker 8: The U.S. government doesn't want to risk losing their first branch as well.

107
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
Speaker 8: Didn't they insist on the right to build Units 3 and 4 in the first place?

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,240
Speaker 8: And now they're forcing it off on us?

109
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,740
Speaker 8: They're really pushing it.

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,900
Speaker 8: Well, you can't blame them, can you?

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,860
Speaker 8: After a disaster like that, anyone would get nervous.

112
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,160
Speaker 8: We'll handle it.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Speaker 8: And how are you going to handle the test activation?

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,280
Speaker 8: Will you use Ray's dummy plug?

115
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,240
Speaker 8: I'll decide soon.

116
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,920
Speaker 8: This is the dummy plug prototype. Ray's personal data has been transferred into it, but our current technology can't really digitize a human mind and soul.

117
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,220
Speaker 8: In the end, this is nothing but a pale duplication that emulates the real pilot's thinking processes. It's still only a machine.

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Speaker 7: It transmits a signal pattern to the AVA. If the AVA believes that there is a pilot and synchronizes, then that's good enough.

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,880
Speaker 7: Load the data into units one and two.

120
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,840
Speaker 8: But we're still working out the bugs, sir.

121
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,720
Speaker 7: Just do it. It's sufficient.

122
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,880
Speaker 8: Yes, sir.

123
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,880
Speaker 7: I've delegated the transport of the unit to the UN.

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,080
Speaker 7: It will be here by the end of the weekend.

125
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,400
Speaker 7: At that time, you will take care of it.

126
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,140
Speaker 8: Yes, sir. We'll perform the modifications and activation test in Matsushiro.

127
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,100
Speaker 7: Hmm. And the test pilot?

128
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,540
Speaker 8: Use of the dummy plug is not recommended.

129
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,100
Speaker 8: One of our candidates...

130
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,720
Speaker 7: Will be chosen as the fourth.

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Speaker 8: Yes, sir. There is one child available whose core can be prepared immediately.

132
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,880
Speaker 7: Then make it so.

133
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,540
Speaker 8: Yes, sir.

134
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,220
Speaker 7: Ray, we're finished now.

135
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Speaker 8: Right.

136
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,220
Speaker 7: Let's eat.

137
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:27,960
Speaker 8: Yes,

138
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,240
Speaker 3: sir.

139
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,440
Speaker 9: Stand up.

140
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,840
Speaker 9: Dismissed.

141
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,760
Speaker 10: Yeah, it's lunchtime at last.

142
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,620
Speaker 10: My very favorite part of the entire school day.

143
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,720
Speaker 10: What?

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,320
Speaker 10: Huh?

145
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:44,680
Speaker 16: Hmm?

146
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,540
Speaker 16: What do you mean you didn't make our lunches?

147
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,680
Speaker 16: I didn't have time to cook last night.

148
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,780
Speaker 16: I had too much homework.

149
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 16: Oh, you did, did you?

150
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,120
Speaker 16: And that's your excuse for me having to go without lunch?

151
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,760
Speaker 10: Uh-oh.

152
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,280
Speaker 10: The newlyweds are fighting.

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,400
Speaker 9: Oh, shut up!

154
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,540
Speaker 8: What's with the grim face?

155
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,980
Speaker 8: Uh, well, it's the Unit 3 activation test.

156
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,300
Speaker 8: We'll be using the fourth as the test pilot.

157
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,320
Speaker 8: The fourth?

158
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,320
Speaker 8: The fourth child's been found?

159
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,740
Speaker 8: Yesterday.

160
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,060
Speaker 8: I haven't received a report from the Marduk Institute.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Speaker 8: Don't worry, Major. You'll get your report.

162
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,700
Speaker 8: Dr. Okagi, are you hiding something from me again?

163
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,880
Speaker 8: No, of course not.

164
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,120
Speaker 8: Well, okay.

165
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,820
Speaker 8: So who's the kid?

166
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,580
Speaker 8: You're kidding! Him?

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Speaker 8: Yes, well, the prospective candidates have to be kept together for their own protection.

168
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,160
Speaker 8: It can't be helped.

169
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,980
Speaker 8: I don't know how to tell them.

170
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,100
Speaker 8: It's hard.

171
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,180
Speaker 3: Asuka will be fine.

172
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,360
Speaker 3: She's committed to piloting in Ava.

173
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,580
Speaker 8: And Rei

174
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,380
Speaker 3: is exceptional.

175
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,520
Speaker 3: We've never had any problems with her.

176
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,060
Speaker 3: Shinji, on

177
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,440
Speaker 8: the other hand, has gone through some pretty bad phases.

178
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,480
Speaker 8: Even depression.

179
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,120
Speaker 8: I don't want to expose him to any more stress.

180
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,080
Speaker 8: I know, but gathering children of this kind is an imperative.

181
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,960
Speaker 8: It's for the sake of our own survival.

182
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,560
Speaker 8: You shouldn't...

183
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,700
Speaker 8: Shouldn't complicate things?

184
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,760
Speaker 8: Of course.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,180
Speaker 9: Class dismissed!

186
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,340
Speaker 17: Bye!

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,720
Speaker 17: See you later!

188
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,360
Speaker 17: Hey,

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Speaker 9: don't forget that you've got bulletin duty this week, Suzuhara.

190
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,820
Speaker 10: I've got what?

191
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 10: The class bulletin,

192
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,800
Speaker 9: remember?

193
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,080
Speaker 9: You're supposed to deliver this to Miss Ayanami.

194
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,100
Speaker 9: Aw,

195
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,860
Speaker 10: come on. Who else has duty?

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,220
Speaker 10: It's you and Ayanami this week.

197
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,960
Speaker 10: It's Ayanami and me?

198
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,700
Speaker 10: Then I guess I got it.

199
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,400
Speaker 10: Huh! But I can't go to some girl's place by myself!

200
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,140
Speaker 10: Well, I can go with you!

201
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,040
Speaker 10: Hey! Shinji! Welcome home with me, will ya?

202
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,400
Speaker 10: You know where Iyanami lives, right?

203
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,840
Speaker 18: Uh, uh, mm-hmm.

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,860
Speaker 10: Hey, Ray, I'm coming in.

205
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,100
Speaker 10: Hey, you can't enter a girl's place without her permission.

206
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Speaker 10: We've got no choice.

207
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,880
Speaker 10: She won't see it

208
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Speaker 14: if we

209
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,580
Speaker 10: leave it here.

210
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,840
Speaker 17: Uh, is anybody home?

211
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Speaker 10: My God.

212
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,980
Speaker 10: This is a girl's room?

213
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,620
Speaker 10: It's so decrepit.

214
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:43,660
Speaker 10: Please.

215
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,120
Speaker 11: You shouldn't touch

216
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,460
Speaker 10: anything.

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,920
Speaker 10: You should get pissed.

218
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,960
Speaker 17: I'm just cleaning

219
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,340
Speaker 11: up.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,540
Speaker 10: Well, I won't help you do it.

221
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
Speaker 10: It's just not manly.

222
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,640
Speaker 11: Well, okay.

223
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,520
Speaker 11: But you know, Misato hates guys like that.

224
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,760
Speaker 11: I don't care. It's my policy,

225
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,480
Speaker 10: all right?

226
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,320
Speaker 10: You know, now that I think about it, you've changed.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,340
Speaker 10: What?

228
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:27,860
Speaker 10: You, Shinji.

229
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,700
Speaker 10: The first time I saw you, I really thought you were the world's biggest jerk.

230
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,600
Speaker 10: I mean, you sure didn't seem like someone who'd do something for someone else back then.

231
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Speaker 10: I guess you were so deep in your shell that I couldn't see the real you.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Speaker 10: Hi. Excuse us.

233
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:54,860
Speaker 3: What for?

234
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,100
Speaker 10: We brought you your school bulletins.

235
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,840
Speaker 11: I'm sorry. I kind of cleaned up. It was just trash, right?

236
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,020
Speaker 11: - I...

237
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,720
Speaker 8: Thank you.

238
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,520
Speaker 10: Man, you Ava pilots sure are a bunch of wackos, huh?

239
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Speaker 10: Thank

240
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,560
Speaker 3: you.

241
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,060
Speaker 3: Words of gratitude.

242
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,020
Speaker 3: Words I've never used.

243
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,860
Speaker 3: Not even with him.

244
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,820
Speaker 12: The city. A paradise made by mankind.

245
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,720
Speaker 7: Driven from paradise, man escaped to this earthly existence on the edge of death.

246
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,240
Speaker 7: Created by the weakest of beings, created by the sapience born from that weakness,

247
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,680
Speaker 7: this paradise is our creation.

248
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,020
Speaker 12: To protect ourselves from the fear death instills,

249
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,200
Speaker 12: To satiate our beings with pleasure, we created a paradise by and of ourselves.

250
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,940
Speaker 12: This city surely is such a paradise. A city designed and built to

251
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,500
Speaker 7: protect us.

252
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,960
Speaker 7: A city for those who run in fear from the outside world. The world of our enemies.

253
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
Speaker 7: Of course, cowards do tend to live longer. That's

254
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,680
Speaker 12: one benefit.

255
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,820
Speaker 17: The

256
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,940
Speaker 12: third new Tokyo. Nerve's hidden intercept base.

257
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,880
Speaker 12: And now, the long-delayed seventh construction phase is about to be finished at last.

258
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Speaker 12: It's almost complete.

259
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,360
Speaker 12: Now, about Unit 4's accident, how will you present that to the committee?

260
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,000
Speaker 12: With the facts. The cause is unknown.

261
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,680
Speaker 12: But this was a major catastrophe.

262
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,560
Speaker 7: It was of no consequence to us.

263
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,500
Speaker 7: The S-2 engine sample may have been lost, but the data is still in Germany.

264
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,480
Speaker 7: This installation and Unit 1 will be sufficient.

265
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Speaker 7: But the committee is in a total panic!

266
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,320
Speaker 7: Of course they're panicked. It wasn't scheduled.

267
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
Speaker 12: Yes. Zele must be busy rewriting

268
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,220
Speaker 7: their schedules now.

269
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,800
Speaker 7: Incidents not depicted in the Dead Sea Scrolls may occur. This should teach the old men a lesson.

270
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,140
Speaker 7: The Intercept system is completed, and they're not going to have any

271
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,780
Speaker 5: party for it?

272
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,160
Speaker 5: NERVE has got to be the most inflexible and stifling organization on Earth!

273
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,480
Speaker 5: Well, it's because of Commander Ikari.

274
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,980
Speaker 5: And are you

275
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,720
Speaker 15: approved too?

276
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,940
Speaker 15: I don't think that's pertinent data, sir.

277
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,300
Speaker 15: And I'm going to have to tell Major Katsuragi and Dr. Akagi about this.

278
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,260
Speaker 5: Not if I cover your mouth with

279
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,540
Speaker 15: mine.

280
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Speaker 15: Kashi! How's it going?

281
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Speaker 5: Uh, well, it's going, I guess.

282
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,720
Speaker 3: Oh, I have work to do. Excuse me?

283
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,960
Speaker 3: Far be it for me to make judgments on your private life,

284
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,680
Speaker 3: But under the current situation, is it wise to be hitting on girls who are under certain chains of command?

285
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,620
Speaker 5: Who's under who's not your concern? Would you prefer to be hit on?

286
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,120
Speaker 3: That depends on how you answer this. You know the secrets behind the Marduk Institute and that Adam thing, right?

287
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,960
Speaker 3: What secrets?

288
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Speaker 3: Don't play games!

289
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,660
Speaker 5: Asking for help isn't like you, Misato.

290
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:25,800
Speaker 3: Well, I'm asking, Kaji. Something stinks here. The way the fourth child was found was too convenient. Something funny's going on.

291
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Speaker 5: I'll tell you one thing.

292
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,160
Speaker 5: The Marduk Institute doesn't exist. Nerve is pulling the strings all by itself.

293
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,540
Speaker 3: Nerve's pulling the strings? Commander Ikari?

294
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,740
Speaker 5: 707 is a good starting place.

295
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,560
Speaker 3: Code 707? But isn't that Shinji's school?

296
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:45,220
Speaker 3: Misato...

297
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,040
Speaker 3: Yes?

298
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,580
Speaker 3: Ritsuko says she's expecting you for a meeting about tomorrow's trip.

299
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,460
Speaker 3: All right, thank you. I'll see you later.

300
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,620
Speaker 5: Uh-huh.

301
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,480
Speaker 5: So, can I buy you a drink, cup of tea?

302
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,820
Speaker 11: Kaji, I'm a boy.

303
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,800
Speaker 11: I thought you'd be a more serious person, Kaji.

304
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,680
Speaker 5: You're saying that to someone as straight arrow and reliable as me, Mr. Ikari?

305
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,680
Speaker 5: I... I'm sorry.

306
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,480
Speaker 5: I'm sorry, too. I didn't mean to sound rude.

307
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,120
Speaker 5: Hey, I want to show you something.

308
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,280
Speaker 2: You grow

309
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,620
Speaker 18: melons?

310
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,020
Speaker 5: Yeah, aren't they cute?

311
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,380
Speaker 5: This is my hobby.

312
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,540
Speaker 5: But keep it a secret, okay?

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,980
Speaker 5: Making something grow is really great.

314
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,900
Speaker 5: One can see and learn so many things from the process.

315
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,700
Speaker 5: It also brings pleasure.

316
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,560
Speaker 5: But pain too, right?

317
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,840
Speaker 5: Do you hate pain?

318
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,480
Speaker 5: I don't like it.

319
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,540
Speaker 5: Ah, but have you found what gives you pleasure?

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,220
Speaker 5: That's not so bad.

321
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,100
Speaker 5: If you've known pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others.

322
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,140
Speaker 5: Being kind isn't a weakness.

323
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,959
Speaker 5: Hello? Yes?

324
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,100
Speaker 5: It's Katsuragi. The sync test will be starting soon.

325
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,800
Speaker 8: I was afraid of this. Shinji's sync ratio is dropping.

326
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,180
Speaker 8: And what's that mean?

327
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,220
Speaker 8: I can't say for sure, but I think that something may have happened to him during that last incident.

328
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,140
Speaker 8: Something's affected him.

329
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,240
Speaker 8: This makes it even harder to tell him about the pilot.

330
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,400
Speaker 8: Well, the new pilot will be informed officially tomorrow.

331
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,780
Speaker 9: Everyone stand up! Dismissed!

332
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,980
Speaker 11: All right! Lunchtime!

333
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,920
Speaker 9: Report to the principal's

334
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,180
Speaker 3: office.

335
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,240
Speaker 14: What?

336
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,500
Speaker 11: What'd you do now?

337
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,580
Speaker 11: I don't know.

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,960
Speaker 10: Excuse me,

339
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,620
Speaker 14: I'm

340
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,600
Speaker 10: Toji Suzuhara.

341
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,540
Speaker 11: You're Toji

342
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,040
Speaker 1: Suzuhara?

343
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,940
Speaker 1: How was your trip to New Yokosuka?

344
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,920
Speaker 11: Oh, it was way cool.

345
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,540
Speaker 11: Speaking of which, I did pick up some disturbing information.

346
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,060
Speaker 11: EVA Unit 3?

347
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,580
Speaker 11: Yeah, the one they built in the U.S.

348
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,140
Speaker 11: It's been completed, hasn't it?

349
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,540
Speaker 11: I don't know.

350
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,900
Speaker 11: I know it's classified, but come on.

351
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,280
Speaker 11: You gotta tell me something.

352
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,120
Speaker 11: But I really don't know.

353
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,460
Speaker 11: Haven't you heard the rumor that the activation test

354
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,960
Speaker 11: will be held at the second test facility in Matsushiro?

355
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,500
Speaker 11: No, I hadn't.

356
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,400
Speaker 11: Then the pilot hasn't been chosen yet?

357
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,180
Speaker 11: How would I know?

358
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
Speaker 11: Misato could choose me for the position.

359
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,420
Speaker 11: Shinji, would you ask her for me?

360
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,620
Speaker 11: I really want to be an EVA pilot.

361
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,760
Speaker 11: I don't know if she could or not.

362
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:44,860
Speaker 11: Hmm.

363
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,900
Speaker 11: Well, what about the story that Unit 4 was lost?

364
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,460
Speaker 11: Was lost?

365
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,780
Speaker 11: You really didn't know?

366
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,500
Speaker 11: It disappeared along with the entire second branch.

367
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,860
Speaker 11: My dad's whole section was in a panic.

368
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,480
Speaker 11: Are you sure?

369
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,840
Speaker 11: I've got my sources.

370
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,280
Speaker 17: Misato didn't tell me anything.

371
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,040
Speaker 11: Well, you know, I guess it doesn't directly concern the pilots.

372
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,880
Speaker 11: If she didn't tell you, it's probably because you don't need to know.

373
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,320
Speaker 11: I'm sorry about bothering you with all these weird questions.

374
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,220
Speaker 11: - Hasn't Toji come back yet?

375
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,820
Speaker 2: - Thus we, mankind, survived the hell called Second Impact

376
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,160
Speaker 2: and rose again.

377
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,040
Speaker 2: The number of children have been decreasing

378
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,240
Speaker 2: on a year-to-year basis.

379
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,460
Speaker 2: - Uh, sorry I'm late.

380
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,460
Speaker 2: - I know about it. Be seated.

381
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,880
Speaker 2: Anyway, it is you, the younger generation,

382
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,840
Speaker 2: who will lead the way to the future.

383
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,840
Speaker 19: - Let's get out of here!

384
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,260
Speaker 19: - And Toji?

385
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,740
Speaker 19: Oh, he's gonna be here late. He's got clean-up duty today.

386
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,660
Speaker 17: The school is now closing. All students

387
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,100
Speaker 9: must go to their homes immediately.

388
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,780
Speaker 9: Um, Suzahara?

389
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,220
Speaker 10: Huh?

390
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,800
Speaker 9: You're... on clean-up duty.

391
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,160
Speaker 9: You have to line up these desks and clean off the blackboards.

392
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Speaker 10: I haven't had lunch yet. I'll do it as soon as I've eaten.

393
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,840
Speaker 9: Do you always buy your lunch from the school shop?

394
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,480
Speaker 10: Well, of course. There's no one at home who can cook.

395
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,960
Speaker 9: Suzuhara?

396
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,900
Speaker 9: I have two sisters. Their names are Kadami and Nozomi,

397
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,040
Speaker 9: and I always make lunches for them every day.

398
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,580
Speaker 10: That's a lot of work.

399
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,500
Speaker 9: I am actually a pretty good cook, though I guess you might not expect that.

400
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,020
Speaker 10: Hmm?

401
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,980
Speaker 9: And you see, I always end up cooking too much for our lunches.

402
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,420
Speaker 10: That's definitely a waste.

403
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
Speaker 10: If you need help getting rid of the leftovers, I'll help.

404
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,380
Speaker 9: Yes, please.

405
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,380
Speaker 16: Hi, Akaji!

406
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,400
Speaker 16: Oh, Asuka.

407
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,620
Speaker 5: Sorry, I'm busy right now. Can it wait?

408
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,180
Speaker 16: Do you have time for Misato?

409
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,260
Speaker 16: No.

410
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:11,980
Speaker 16: Gaji!

411
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,700
Speaker 5: Dammit! Not right now.

412
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,280
Speaker 16: Oh, these are our sync data reports.

413
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,940
Speaker 16: Huh? Four? Oh my god, the hammer! It can't be!

414
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,540
Speaker 16: Who in the hell made him the fourth child?

415
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,680
Speaker 16: I won't stand for it!

416
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,200
*Loud noise*

417
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,700
I'm not sure what you're doing

418
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,660
Speaker 18: Fill my heart with songs

419
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,040
Speaker 18: And let me sing forevermore

420
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,960
Speaker 18: You are all I long for

421
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,900
Speaker 18: All I worship and adore

422
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Speaker 18: In other words

423
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,620
Speaker 17: Please be true

424
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,660
Speaker 17: In other words

425
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,120
I love you

426
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:03,360
Another one, I love you.
