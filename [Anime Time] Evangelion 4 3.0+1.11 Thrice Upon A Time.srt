1
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,360
This is the Evangelion.

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm not going to die.

3
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,500
I will try to make you move on.

4
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,980
I'll take a while.

5
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,880
You won't. I'll protect you.

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,200
He didn't want to go back to Ever.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,740
I'll have to go down on his feet.

8
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,120
I'll have to be in his own.

9
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,060
- I'll do it.

10
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:13,500
- I'll do it.

11
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,400
Bye.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,760
I'll do it again.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,360
I love you!

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,180
I don't know if you want to do this thing.

15
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,060
I will not be able to laugh at you.

16
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,240
You have a child who helped you.

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,540
The

18
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,880
Evo 2号機.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,480
You're a idiot.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,220
-

21
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,660
I want to ride

22
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,340
How you're a little bit of a surprise.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,280
You

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:19,700
can't

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,020
I'm not going to do anything.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,780
I'm not going to do anything.

27
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,780
That's weird.

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,480
I'm suddenly like this.

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,800
I don't understand.

30
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,420
I've been waiting for 14 years.

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,300
I'm a leader of the Vile.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm a leader of the NELF.

33
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm a child of NELF.

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,680
I'm a child of your own life.

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,820
The Evan Gellion 13th.

36
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,000
The moment that came, that young man and the Eva-NelF.

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,260
Eva

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,140
-NelFだけは乗らない.

39
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,460
You're

40
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,920
not going to do anything.

41
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,400
You're not going

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,680
to die.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,340
The door opened the EVA's door, and it was a trigger for third impact.

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
It was all you had to do.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,480
You did not know what to do.

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:11,980
I'm not sure.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,980
You're going to start with third impact.

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,840
You're going to get your hands off your hands off your hands.

49
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,540
You're going to die for the world.

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,260
You're going to be like Mishoto.

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,020
Mishoto, I'm going to be the TSS.

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,540
You're going to stop.

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,340
You're going to be a fool!

54
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,340
What

55
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,060
is this?

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,700
Force Impact.

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,060
That's the beginning of the celebration.

58
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,580
It's

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,220
my fault.

60
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm going to take my gun.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,880
This is my command.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,180
Don't forget that.

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,640
We'll meet again, Shinji.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,620
Kauru!

65
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,340
I'm not a good thing.

66
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm a really bad guy.

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm not a sin.

68
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,720
I hope there is still there.

69
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,200
Whatever time.

70
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,320
*Sings*

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm not sure

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,680
I'm going to

73
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:10,840
I'm going to go to the next stage.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm going to start the operation.

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
I'm

76
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm going to

77
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,780
Check it out.

78
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,580
As the plan, the 4-2-A is all on the 8-5-A.

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,960
The time for 420 seconds

80
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,240
is over.

81
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,540
It's time to take

82
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:33,920
care of

83
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,320
the crew.

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,020
It's like a 8-bit of a icon.

85
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
It's like an evil system.

86
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,760
It's easy to control the human language.

87
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,740
Stage 4 is clear.

88
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm sure I'm going to make a lot of effort.

89
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm not going to make it.

90
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,260
Yes.

91
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,340
Turn it!

92
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,540
*Many

93
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,920
Don't let go!

94
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,620
I'm not going to

95
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,740
Yeah

96
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,760
Yeah

97
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,860
*Skills*

98
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,600
4, 2, B, high energy, high energy, high energy!

99
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,840
All-in, the G:1 is in the right.

100
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,000
This

101
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:56,260
is

102
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:56,820
I'm going to get the target.

103
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,140
I'll do it!

104
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,720
I don't know.

105
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,340
Oh

106
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm sorry.

107
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,220
Excuse more FL!

108
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,520
4,4,C!

109
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,700
I'm completely silent!

110
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,280
The rest of the work is 30

111
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:09,700
seconds

112
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
*Many's

113
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,700
*sad*

114
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,940
You can always go to where you are.

115
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,240
Wait,

116
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,120
Wanko.

117
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,340
The End

118
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,360
¶¶

119
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,080
¶¶

120
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm not sure how

121
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,620
I'll move you

122
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,760
It's okay, then I'll go home

123
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,939
I'm going to get your heart out

124
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,120
It's a little cold

125
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,699
Teacher, you're not wearing that much

126
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,140
Well, it's okay

127
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,520
And it's like a cat

128
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm

129
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:25,760
going to talk to you

130
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm going to talk to you today

131
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,640
I'll get out of here.

132
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,240
Let's go.

133
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,780
This is strange.

134
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,320
There are a lot of people.

135
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,660
What? Is it the first time to go to the people?

136
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,620
Here is one of the oldest living in the house that has been gathered in the village.

137
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,220
The third village is a village.

138
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,420
I live in a thousand people.

139
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,060
That's the food station.

140
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:05,800
Three days a week.

141
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,580
I'll be giving you a good job.

142
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,740
Teacher, hello.

143
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,420
Oh, you're waiting for it.

144
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,660
You're right, right?

145
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,580
I don't have to worry.

146
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,040
Teacher, you two?

147
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,300
I gave you credit for the credit card.

148
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,620
Well, that's all.

149
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,080
I'll ask you a good job.

150
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:21,780
Yes.

151
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,060
Then I'll be sorry.

152
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Oh!

153
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,560
What is the credit?

154
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,900
Credit is the thing that Ville made the support group.

155
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,740
Only for the money.

156
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,320
We also have to make the trade with other towns.

157
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,980
We're living in the town.

158
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,320
What

159
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,320
is that?

160
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,160
The shape of the dog is different.

161
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,300
Huh? That's a cat.

162
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,540
Cat?

163
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,580
Is it the first time you see a cat?

164
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,660
You're living in the car at the bottom of the car.

165
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,660
There's only a cat and a cat there, so you're happy.

166
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,160
This is the old house that is fun to eat.

167
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,800
I'll take a lot of food in a house.

168
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,300
I'm going to eat the dinner table right now.

169
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,280
Hey, I'm going to eat the dinner table.

170
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,500
Hey, everyone, wait a minute.

171
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,060
Let's eat the hot sauce.

172
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,260
You're hungry, you're hungry.

173
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,680
You don't have to eat it.

174
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,400
Well, if you want to eat, you'll come here.

175
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,680
-

176
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,840
I

177
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
was not convinced I could not believe it, but

178
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm

179
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,140
still a dream like

180
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,580
this.

181
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,800
It's been a long time, IKARI.

182
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,240
And you too?

183
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,580
No, I'm not a YANAMI.

184
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,700
What is it?

185
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,100
Well...

186
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:09,900
So...

187
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,100
So-kuri!

188
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,540
What's this?

189
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,580
Oh, I'm the daughter of the woman.

190
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,300
It's a flower.

191
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,360
It's cute, right?

192
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,540
But it's a little.

193
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,040
Why did you have to be small?

194
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,100
What's that? Did you see the first time you saw?

195
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,960
When you were born, you were younger.

196
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,980
The children are more smaller.

197
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

198
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,640
I don't know. What would you do with Ayanami?

199
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,160
You're different from Ayanami, right?

200
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,660
I'd like to do something that you think about yourself.

201
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,600
You're different from

202
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:38,600
that?

203
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,900
It's been a long time, IKARI.

204
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,260
It's a long time, Aida.

205
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:47,640
Yes.

206
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,520
Well, Kensuke, I'll help you.

207
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,880
I've also helped you with this survival of the time.

208
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,920
If you don't have any time, I'll be able to go to the old age of the time.

209
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,220
Shinji-kun, you're good. But eat your food. That's the honor!

210
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,120
Well,

211
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,560
my father... I didn't have to ask you to eat the food.

212
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,640
I'm not sure if you were to get out of here.

213
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,940
But, Tōji, you can take a lot of money and eat it in a mouth.

214
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
Hey, Shinji!

215
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,940
My father, the Tsun is getting up.

216
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,700
Let's go and take a shower.

217
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,520
Look, you, Ikari and Ikari.

218
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,260
No, Ikari is taking a good job.

219
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,900
I think it's better.

220
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:48,920
It's a surprise.

221
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,960
I was married at the time when I was in high school.

222
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:13,760
The result was "N

223
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,820
I don't know how to do this.

224
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,980
I'm going to get to the street right now, I got it.

225
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,620
We're

226
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,900
going to have a self-build house for a long time.

227
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,260
I'll use it as well.

228
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,040
The toilet is in the middle of the car.

229
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,160
I'll take the fuel for the first time.

230
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:59,340
I'm so sorry

231
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:28,660
Just like the anger

232
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,100
It's not that you're the best tool, right?

233
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,280
I'm gonna leave it alone.

234
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,500
I don't want to go.

235
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,460
I don't want to go.

236
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
Icar, I'm fine now.

237
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm just going to meet you again.

238
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:57,960
I'll just tell you what you like.

239
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,620
You're a friend, right?

240
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,460
I'm glad I'm going to live with you.

241
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,900
Hmm.

242
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,980
The manager.

243
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,140
I don't want you to remember.

244
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm so sorry.

245
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,020
Good morning, you.

246
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
What's your day?

247
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,960
That's right.

248
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,940
I'm so sorry to sleep.

249
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,500
Good morning, Sokuri.

250
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,520
I'm tired of sleeping.

251
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,200
"Honey"

252
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,040
is what?

253
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,360
That's right.

254
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,200
What do you think of the dream?

255
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,380
Good morning, Sockri-san

256
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,440
The KENKEN is coming to 6:00.

257
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,720
I'm already out of work

258
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,820
The morning is there

259
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,040
Let's eat it!

260
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,180
It's a nice girl

261
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,320
The wife told me that Sockri-san is here

262
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,659
I'm here for today

263
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,540
What's your name?

264
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,220
You're a lot of names.

265
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,180
You're okay with your help?

266
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,100
You're working with your help.

267
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,860
You're working.

268
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,100
You're going to be so you're going to be so.

269
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,460
You're not going to be working.

270
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:14,920
What's your job?

271
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,980
What's it?

272
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,060
You don't have to think about it.

273
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,540
Well, everyone's汗水.

274
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,420
汗水?

275
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,080
You're just a little bit of hand.

276
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,220
So, you can put it on the right side from the right side.

277
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,420
I can't hold it. I just put your指 on.

278
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,300
I'll just be able to get慣れて.

279
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,100
You're

280
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,660
only slow, so you're just getting close.

281
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,660
Yes.

282
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,260
This is water

283
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,060
Ah!

284
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,020
Ah!

285
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,420
Ah!

286
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,640
This is work

287
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,020
Oh, I've got to find a place

288
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,780
It's not enough

289
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,860
I'll take it

290
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,500
It's not enough

291
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,860
You've been working today

292
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,179
I've been doing this

293
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,420
This is the first day I worked for, so it's special

294
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,760
What should I say to you?

295
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,360
Thank you

296
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,760
Thank you

297
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Let's

298
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,840
I don't know.

299
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,240
Oh

300
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
What's"? That's

301
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
right, you know,

302
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,920
It's all so bad.

303
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,620
It's hard to say that, but...

304
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,080
I'll have to go again.

305
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,140
The bullseye!

306
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,060
Just like eating the food, I'm so grateful!

307
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:51,520
You're still a little bit of a lilii!

308
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm gonna live in a living!

309
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
So eat it!

310
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,060
I'm just a water

311
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,700
It's all for me, so I don't want to do anything anymore

312
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,540
Even if I'm a father's saying

313
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,040
If you're the精神 level, I'd like to go to Eva!

314
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:58,920
You're alone,

315
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,260
girl.

316
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,500
*Screams*

317
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,620
*Screams*

318
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:14,760
I

319
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,700
I

320
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,740
think so. I think I'll

321
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:54,820
*sad*

322
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,000
My name?

323
00:33:59,660 --> 00:33:59,860
Yeah,

324
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:00,660
I don't care for you

325
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,620
It's a talk about your name, but you don't forget your name

326
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,480
If you want to put it in your own

327
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,600
Name...

328
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,379
Put it in?

329
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,419
*sad music*

330
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,639
Hon...

331
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,840
Ikari-kun's said...

332
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,139
*crickets

333
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
I'm one person.

334
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,080
I'm a person who's always here.

335
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,100
I'm always here.

336
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,780
I'm always here.

337
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,520
It's the best, Maseka.

338
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:21,980
Who's here?

339
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm...

340
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,120
The first Rod?

341
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm open the door.

342
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,620
Icon, I've heard you live here.

343
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,240
I'm not here.

344
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:02,880
I'm not sure how to do it.

345
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,860
I think I can't believe that I'm going to be a good one.

346
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:31,240
So, if you're going to be a good one, I'll be able to take the

347
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,240
next step.

348
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,960
I'm going to take the next step.

349
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,580
*Gunshot*

350
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,060
I'll get you back

351
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,840
leads me into mystery.

352
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,860
I'm lost in the days.

353
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,500
Don't know if I've been there before.

354
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,060
My future there is vague.

355
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,400
I can only take a little.

356
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,200
Courage and conviction of my thoughts.

357
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,180
If I will ever see it through.

358
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,840
Such is the hand of faith

359
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,420
Have I ever been here before

360
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,580
Is

361
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,480
it better that I don't

362
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,140
know

363
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Have I anything left but faith

364
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,500
Can I trust in

365
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,820
my destiny

366
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,320
Is it out of my hands to see

367
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,360
Must I live by the hand of faith

368
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,740
Is it playing a trick on me?

369
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:16,780
Is it making me think I'm gonna be somewhere in the past with love that I thought was gone for good?

370
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,140
It's just that I'll never see the day.

371
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,340
If you're another world away.

372
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,500
Then I will never see the day

373
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,000
If you're a million miles away

374
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,640
Who holds all the aces in the hand of fate?

375
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:50,960
The

376
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
End

377
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,360
I'll come here. I'll wait for you.

378
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,020
Well, that's it.

379
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,160
I'll be able to get to this town.

380
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,460
Why do you not return to the town?

381
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,800
Icari is not doing anything here.

382
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,780
You are also the people who are守ing this town?

383
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,440
I'm not going to protect myself.

384
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,220
I've broken myself.

385
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,460
I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk.

386
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,240
I don't want to come.

387
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,460
I want to stay.

388
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,000
Why are you so優しい?

389
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,160
I like you.

390
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,360
Thank you.

391
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,740
I'm

392
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:19,740
sorry

393
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
I'm sorry

394
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,000
Hmm, it's over at home.

395
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,180
Thank you for the first time of the LOD.

396
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,520
You just can't cry and feel like you were so happy.

397
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,500
So, if you were to move,

398
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,260
you can't stand for your job.

399
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,760
Sometimes you can drive, right?

400
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,840
It's a change of mood.

401
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:42,500
We are going to be exempt from

402
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,520
I want to use the water that I have to use.

403
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,840
I want to make sure that the forest is left behind.

404
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,560
The 3rd place of life is a water system.

405
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,900
The water is important to check the water system.

406
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,340
The water is a matter of life.

407
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,160
I'll see the water in the next few weeks.

408
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,160
I'm going to work with the怒り.

409
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:12,920
I'll ask you to prepare your food.

410
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,760
No, I've never done anything.

411
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,340
I don't have to do it.

412
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,260
I'll tell you.

413
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,860
Well, I don't care.

414
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,100
My number is one of our units.

415
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:29,800
Next is...

416
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
That's the "Vile" of the house.

417
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,660
It's a type of "L-Q-R-L-R-A-L-R-A-L-R-A-L-R-A

418
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,060
I'm not afraid of it.

419
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,820
But I'm sure I'm going to live in a long time.

420
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,000
That's the bread.

421
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,820
I'm enjoying it every year.

422
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,820
I'm going to live with a hard time and a fun time.

423
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,920
I'm going to live with a good day today, right?

424
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,820
I'm the youngest in my life, and I want to live well.

425
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,460
There are also some Tumas.

426
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,800
Really, I'm so excited.

427
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,860
Sokuri, you can always stay here.

428
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,300
My name?

429
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,900
So, you're ready?

430
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,900
Yeah, I'm not sure.

431
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,260
Then, let's go ahead and ask someone.

432
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,240
Your name?

433
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,420
So, I'd like to put a name here. I'd like to be here.

434
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,720
That's why I have a name for my name.

435
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,060
So, I'd like to put a name here.

436
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,140
If I'm a name, you're not the one.

437
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,480
Whatever name is, I want to be the name of the Ikari.

438
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,080
The first Rod, do you think it's working?

439
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,960
Yeah, I was here today, but what?

440
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,420
I think so.

441
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,660
I'll do it.

442
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
So

443
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,860
I can't live with Nelv

444
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,360
Do you know, Shinji?

445
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,680
You've been a little bit of a time here

446
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,560
- Yeah, a little bit.

447
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,860
- That's right, too.

448
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,080
The city of this town has never been able to get down.

449
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,500
- It was hard to get down.

450
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,240
- Right, right?

451
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,120
There were a lot of things that were all about.

452
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,320
It was like a bad guy, and it was a world that was not able to live.

453
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,260
We were able to become a big guy and become a big guy.

454
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:56,920
We could have done something for the family.

455
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,840
I was able to say something that I could live

456
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,480
I want to make a good job

457
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,300
I'm living here

458
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,400
Shinji

459
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,280
I'm gonna fight for you

460
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,320
I'll be here

461
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,140
I'll be here

462
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,720
I'll be here

463
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,440
Thank you

464
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:23,820
I don't know what I'm saying

465
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,660
The love remains

466
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,580
My wife was a great man, but she was so good

467
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,920
She was born and born

468
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,480
again

469
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,760
My wife also was happy to cry

470
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,860
Oh, you're laughing

471
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,760
You're cute. Really?

472
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:27,840
I'm not sure

473
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,460
It's hard to get out of here, but I'm

474
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:40,740
going to be able to

475
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,600
It's

476
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:58,980
been a long time.

477
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,300
You're a new teacher?

478
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,480
Well, that's it.

479
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,920
It's the first time you know.

480
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,580
I'm Kaji. Kaji Ryoji.

481
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,140
What's your name?

482
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,280
How's it, Ikari? You're a good guy.

483
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,860
Yes. But the last one, Kaji...

484
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:33,540
Oh, I'm a child of Misato and Kaji. I'm 14. I don't know what my parents are. It's a wish for Misato.

485
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,280
I'm not sure what you can do without a mother. I'm just going to protect the child's responsibility.

486
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,140
Oh, Kaji?

487
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,800
You're not alone.

488
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,920
You're also suffering.

489
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,840
I'm going to

490
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,500
*muchin'

491
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,520
"Goodbye, good morning... thank you"

492
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,000
"Goodbye"

493
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,040
"Good morning"

494
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,820
"Good morning? How did you get this morning?"

495
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,300
"Ikari would like to see you"

496
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,680
"This"

497
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,760
Oh, thank you.

498
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,760
That's what I asked for.

499
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,100
I'm not sure.

500
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,720
Thank you.

501
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,560
You've been thinking about your name.

502
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,140
I'm just happy.

503
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,980
You can't live here.

504
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,600
But here is my favorite.

505
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,420
Ayaanami?

506
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,200
I understood that I'm happy.

507
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,760
Ayaanami, what was it?

508
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,080
I wanted to go to the forest.

509
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,220
*sad*

510
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:48,540
Oh, my God.

511
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,600
Oh, that's a good one.

512
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,700
That's a big one.

513
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,000
The leader of the Rican希望 is out there.

514
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,340
We're about to get a fight.

515
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,900
No, I'll take it.

516
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,920
I'm sorry, but I'll leave the record for today.

517
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,060
That's it. If you're right, I'll do

518
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:19,060
it.

519
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,440
What did you do?

520
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,840
*sad*

521
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,580
...Suzuhara...

522
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,660
...Sakura-san...

523
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,520
...

524
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,920
...I'm going to get out!

525
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,880
I'm so sorry to say that I'm not going to get out of it!

526
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:11,240
...I'm so sorry to say that!

527
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,640
...I'm sorry to say that...

528
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:26,820
...I'm sorry to

529
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,180
I'm going to go to

530
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,860
I'm sure that it's better than that.

531
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
There's a copy of the command.

532
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,380
That's why another pilot has been showing the situation in front of the front of the crew.

533
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,400
I'm sure he's back to the crew.

534
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:15,980
Why?

535
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:21,720
I think that's the case for me.

536
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:29,600
The report from the

537
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,560
How do you do the situation with the other weapon and the艦外 work?

538
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,940
The 4th weapon and the艦外 work is no problem with

539
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,460
the艦外 dock.

540
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,680
The EVA-1-0-0-3% is over 3% of the weapon.

541
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,200
Speed優先!

542
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,580
I'll take a check on the 5/5.

543
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,020
Yes!

544
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,380
N-1 rocket, 2nd of the 2nd of the air, 5 minutes.

545
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,100
The removal of the weapon is good.

546
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,200
But why are those weapons together?

547
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,060
I'll take it to the NERV again.

548
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,220
The EVE is a disaster

549
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:50,820
in

550
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,320
I believe I am a man who is a man who is a man.

551
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,780
Everyone is so sweet.

552
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,600
I don't know if I am the only one who is in the middle of the world.

553
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,820
I think I am ready to die.

554
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,360
I don't think that's enough.

555
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,640
The new 2号機 of JA parts and the connection to the test.

556
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,080
As you can see, the operation of the SAAA is going to be done.

557
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,660
The power of the fire is increased.

558
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,760
We are not the only ones that are less than us.

559
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:23,980
Hello.

560
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,120
Hello, honey!

561
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,120
I want to see you in the middle of the night.

562
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,800
I want to see you in the night.

563
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,320
What are you doing here?

564
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,660
There's a lot of books in the room.

565
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,180
The books are the集合体 of human beings.

566
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,200
We're going to read all of the books in the countryside.

567
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,980
That's my dream of the best.

568
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,080
By the way,

569
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,280
What was the progress of your life with?

570
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,440
I don't have any interest

571
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,600
Oh, you're not a man of the age of a girl

572
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:54,360
I don't have a girl

573
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,620
I don't need a girl

574
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,520
My mother

575
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,000
The operation of the company

576
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,600
from the company

577
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,540
is done

578
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,060
The company's logistics is ready

579
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,560
The company's company is ready

580
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,260
The company's company is ready to approve the company's own

581
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,840
and the company's entire limited service

582
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:38,060
I'm not sure what

583
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,580
NERV is starting to move, and the Black Sun is in the middle of the night of the Black Sun.

584
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:39,260
The Black Sun is the only thing that is to be the Black Sun is the return of the Black Sun.

585
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,900
It's a simple thing that's the body of Adam's body.

586
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,660
It's a simple human body, and it's a simple human being created with a pure soul.

587
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,260
It's the "Advanced Ayanami" series.

588
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,980
The plan of human being saving people.

589
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,740
The first step to the fear of the fear of the fear of the human being is this.

590
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,300
The third boy came back to Vile.

591
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:22,640
I don't know

592
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,140
what I'm

593
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:39,540
I don't need to meet you

594
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,100
I'm a experience.

595
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,120
Second Impact.

596
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,420
Come on, Shinji!

597
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:23,740
It's not for anyone!

598
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:25,960
It's for you!

599
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,940
The chief, this is the NER

600
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:14,860
I'm ready to

601
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:20,420
go

602
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,820
You can't

603
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:47,480
change

604
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,420
the

605
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,420
I'll bring you back to the

606
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,340
I'm sure that's it

607
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,600
At that time, I really wanted to leave the hospital with a fire

608
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,720
I guess... if there was a child in the middle of the MISATO, I would have been forgiven

609
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,420
I'm in a position, so I'm going to go to the hospital block

610
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,420
IKARI, please don't move there

611
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,440
If you're in a place, please call me on the red button

612
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,200
Then,

613
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:48,900
let's go.

614
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:14,420
The plug-in-suit

615
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,220
I'm going to start the 8th of the Dragon Carrier, no matter what.

616
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,799
The test is no longer, let's go to the main stage.

617
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,020
The final

618
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:26,880
6th bolt is removed.

619
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,000
The main task is now in the射出.

620
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:41,980
This is a camera.

621
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:44,100
I want to take a walk.

622
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,359
Yeah

623
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:47,680
That's

624
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:53,620
Are you done

625
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,359
You can't you

626
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:57,680
Hint

627
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,160
I'm a big woman

628
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,580
I'm a big woman

629
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,140
I'm a parachute

630
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,520
You're still a great person

631
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,040
I'm a Mari

632
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,319
Machina Mi Marie Lastrias

633
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,400
I'll be back

634
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,359
I'll be back

635
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,200
Vile no one cook

636
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,799
Chito変わったね

637
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,060
What's the smell of a big one?

638
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,700
It's not that easy to change, this guy

639
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,520
I'll tell you later

640
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm gonna fight you

641
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:32,140
I understand?

642
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,020
Asuka was riding the 3-5-5-5

643
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,060
I didn't want anything to do.

644
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,759
I didn't want to help me, and I didn't want to kill myself.

645
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,080
I'm not sure what I'm doing.

646
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,960
I'll tell you, so I'll tell you.

647
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,860
I've always been eating your dinner.

648
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,480
I thought you liked Shinji.

649
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,120
But I've become a big fan.

650
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:10,740
Okay, then.

651
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,160
You are doing well. You're so good, Icarim.

652
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,120
Bye.

653
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,640
Hi-me, you're so excited?

654
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,560
Yes, I'm so excited.

655
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,760
"EVA Pilot" "EVA

656
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:27,980
I'm not going to be able to do that.

657
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,300
This is the end of the game, as well as the force impact,

658
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,440
the new NELF team is in the next part of the game.

659
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,340
This is the end of the game's game,

660
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:45,680
and the end of the game is the end of the game.

661
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,360
I'll take a look at this entire chaos.

662
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,920
I'll go!

663
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:52,120
- Team!

664
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,660
The entry is over.

665
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,000
We are going to go to the enemy mode.

666
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,900
We can enter the unit of the ship.

667
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,240
We can cut the link to the link.

668
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,940
We can change the system and control system.

669
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,680
We can enter the unit of the ship.

670
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,620
*Balloon music plays*

671
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,300
All blocks are in the L5.

672
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,640
I need to go ahead

673
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:30,900
and

674
01:13:49,580 --> 01:14:03,940
I'm going to enter the area of

675
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,700
I'm sorry to have a good time

676
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,300
I'll

677
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,280
be able to get the point to the L-GETKAI to go, I'll be able to get the point left

678
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,120
I'll be ready, I'll be ready

679
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,960
I'm not going to be the 2nd, I'm not sure

680
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,020
I'm not going to be the same way

681
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,020
The 2nd, the 2nd, the air raid

682
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:43,600
I've already finished

683
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,560
I'm sorry, let's get to the moment I'll be able to do it

684
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,480
The second time is to go to the 13th century.

685
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,240
The same power of the magic of the dragon, too.

686
01:14:59,100 --> 01:14:59,940
The ultimate battle!

687
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,360
The ultimate battle.

688
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,440
We're ready to go to the point of the NERV.

689
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:05,960
Let's go!

690
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,200
*Lighting*

691
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,340
Wow!

692
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,700
I'm

693

Oh

696
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:31,820
Oh

697
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,720
I'm going to hit the right hand!

698
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,940
That's not a good one!

699
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:17,880
Turn the power!

700
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,880
Roll the clock 180 degrees!

701
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,320
I'm going to put it in the air!

702
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,420
I'm going to get it!

703
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:34,460
*Lighting*

704
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,220
"Do you use the third hand on the sword?

705
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:45,100
I'm not sure if I'm confused."

706
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,700
*Lighting*

707
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm going to get

into

the

01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,340
I'm not sure what you're doing.

711
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:23,680
I've got a new gun at the

I'm

713
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,560
not expecting that.

714
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,200
The 13th

01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,960
Yeah, hoi!

717
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,560
Doke!

718
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,040
Doけ!

719
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:44,920
Hey,

720
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,200
I'm going to go!

721
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:50,500
I'm going to go!

01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,820
The

Lio-ki, Welf-Hombring, come!

725
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,400
The 6/4 is at the bottom of the rocket's base.

The EVEA 13th century... I was able to...

729
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:08,920
I was waiting for the Lord's hope to get the first time to make people's first mission.

730
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:21,960
The third-party-class war-like war-like war-like war-like war-like war-like war-like war-like war-like war

is

01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,960
the end!

734
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,060
What's wrong?

735
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,520
What are you doing?

736
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,200
It's strange!

737
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,620
I'll destroy the Nelfi ship!

738
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,580
The second impact is the time of the world's death.

739
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,120
The hell is again open.

740
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:37,680
What is it?

741
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,420
The eyes of the light?

742
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,100
The second impact is the force of the force.

743
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:57,680
No, Gahf's ship is not able to be able to trigger the ship.

744
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,680
This is not a scenario of the X-ray.

745
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,680
It's not a complete surprise.

746
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:04,060
It's an amazing impact.

747
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,500
The situation is not enough.

748
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,880
The plan is to destroy the NELF.

749
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,280
The first time

750
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,060
we'll be ready to go to the 3rd.

751
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,520
We'll be able to go to the 3rd.

752
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:17,620
The first time we're ready to go to the 3rd.

753
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:18,980
The first time we're

754
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:27,660
ready

755
01:26:58,660 --> 01:26:59,620
I'm sure

756
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,260
I'll be able to finish it!

757
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:03,100
I'm

758
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,020
not

759
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:04,840
going to be able to do anything!

760
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,940
I'm sorry, I'm not going to be the last method.

761
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,840
I'm still going to get you.

762
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,300
I'm going to get the limit!

763
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,260
I'm going to go to the 3-9!

764
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,660
*Pain*

765
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,140
I'll kill you, Blatt!

766
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,340
I'll

767
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:58,880
kill you!

768
01:27:59,400 --> 01:27:59,940
I don't know.

769
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:30,140
Ah!

770
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,380
Ah!

771
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:32,780
Ah!

772
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:33,280
Ah!

773
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:45,800
Ah!

774
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,720
H...姫!

775
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:52,800
People...

776
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:53,320
...stereki!

777
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:23,360
I'll be able to

778
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,340
Ah!

779
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,600
Ah...

780
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:45,380
You're the same

781
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,460
*gunshot

782
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:26,000
Oh

783
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:11,100
*Panical music*

784
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,000
"Masker!"

785
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:17,580
"The new 2nd, all the signals are lost. The pilot's situation is not clear!"

786
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,020
"The rocket's N2-3, the air!

787
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,520
The air! What is this?

788
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,840
"What is this?!

789
01:31:28,099 --> 01:31:29,740
What's that? I'm stuck!

790
01:31:34,179 --> 01:31:36,680
The pattern is the same. The OPP-H type is the same.

791
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,480
I've been in the M9.

792
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,340
It's a bad thing! The body is being absorbed!

793
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,680
I'm not going to

794
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,600
Look

795
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,520
at FUYUTSUKI FUKSHIR, it's amazing.

796
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:43,060
The movement of the original Lilith and the force of the black-eyed sword.

797
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:49,620
The team has been整ed. How do you play the final line?

798
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:50,660
Ika-Li.

799
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:54,520
Let me check the enemy of the army!

800
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:58,580
Ika-Li.

801
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,860
Sorry, my sister.

802
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,260
It's the end of the

803
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,300
I can't wait for this place.

804
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,320
I'm sorry.

805
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:27,840
Ikari, sir.

806
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,680
You've been so hard, Katsuragi-dai-san.

807
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,200
I'm going to use this ship as soon as I can.

808
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,020
You?

809
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:46,700
You don't have to worry about the purpose of the mission.

810
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:51,140
Yes. I'm going to teach you.

811
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:52,680
*gunshot

812
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:52,680
*

813
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:03,660
*gunshot*

814
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,360
No one's no harm.

815
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,580
All of us will be accepted.

816
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,240
Icari Gendo,

817
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,080
Nebkadonethal's key,

818
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,060
and let them die.

819
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:22,340
I'll just put the information on this world

820
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,280
There's no problem.

821
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:33,100
I killed the Lord, and I'm going to

822
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,040
This is the end of the day.

823
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,460
No, it's the first time of the universe of the beginning of this planet.

824
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,500
We're going to change all the souls of the core.

825
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,820
We're

826
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,700
going to start the first phase of the Force Impact.

827
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,440
Yes.

828
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:40,260
The second impact is the sea,

829
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,020
the third impact is the sea,

830
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,400
and the fourth impact is the sea,

831
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:46,140
and the force is the soul.

832
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,440
What is the core of the

833
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:25,960
The mission of God gave the birth of two people

834
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:21,760
This is all the horsemen.

835
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,740
Then, I'll return the E.V.A.

836
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:37,120
I'll return the E.V.A.

837
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:39,720
Father!

838
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,620
Oh, my.

839
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,640
The End

840
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,420
*BOOM*

841
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,860
Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to stop the building.

842
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,200
I'll never stop the building.

843
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:15,980
I'll be the first one.

844
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:20,020
Misato, I'm going to be the EVA first one.

845
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,080
I'm

846
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:47,080
sorry.

847
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,340
I'll take it over half a half

848
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:55,660
That's why I'll fight with Gendou

849
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,420
I want to make my own reward

850
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:16,820
Stop it!

851
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,580
I'm not kidding

852
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,500
I'm not going to be able to get to Eva

853
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,520
I thought I was going to be like this

854
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:31,640
Sergeant! This situation was no requirement for the attack

855
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:33,780
My doctor!

856
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:36,080
You're the reason why you're in the Nia-San

857
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,600
My life is so huge!

858
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:40,920
All the things you're in the world

859
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:45,420
You're not allowed to forgive me

860
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,240
Ah

861
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,040
Sakura

862
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,780
Icarin Shin

863
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:19,660
Yes

864
01:41:22,099 --> 01:41:22,760
Misato

865
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,540
Misato

866
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:27,440
It's good

867
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:31,580
14 years ago you didn't have to ride the EVA

868
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,020
I was already dead

869
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,280
So I'm thankful

870
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,300
And even though I was a person who was born

871
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,740
I have all my responsibility

872
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:51,680
I am the director of the Katsuragi-missato, and I am the responsible for the action of his actions.

873
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,040
I have to prove all of the Shinshi-kun.

874
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:04,000
That's it!

875
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:07,660
I am the king of my life!

876
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:11,040
But my father also has to be dead!

877
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,260
I got you

878
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,460
I'm not a enemy! I'm not a enemy!

879
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:20,960
I'm not going to die!

880
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:21,280
I'm fine!

881
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:23,300
You're fine, Sakura

882
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:27,300
I'll just think of the future that we'll live in tomorrow

883
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:29,400
I'm not going to die!

884
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:38,780
Renko!

885
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,740
I've been getting ready!

886
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,440
Let's go!

887
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:47,020
Wanko!

888
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,440
Maya, I have a plug-in bag of the plug-in.

889
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,180
The ball will just break.

890
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,720
I'm doing it now.

891
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,520
You're okay,将尉.

892
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,800
Icari Shinji-kun, I want to kill my father to my son,

893
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,200
or kill him, or kill him.

894
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,720
I'm taking a job.

895
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,040
Misato, I met him with my job.

896
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:20,360
You were good?

897
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:21,860
Yes.

898
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,240
I'm good.

899
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:26,880
He was a really good guy.

900
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:31,240
I haven't talked a little bit, but I like him.

901
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:32,520
Thank you.

902
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,680
I'll always support you.

903
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:40,280
I'll ask you, Shinji.

904
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,160
Misoto, I'll go.

905
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:47,440
I'll go.

906
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,780
*Muchasperial music*

907
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:19,220
I'm going to create a new miracle

908
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:26,640
Overlapping-like development and the 4-in-1 system that we have to use for the power of Adam's device

909
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:29,640
We're all going through this universe

910
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,080
It's a great thing

911
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:39,420
Well, Wanko, what you're doing is that the anti-L systems are all stopped and everyone is breaking up

912
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,960
Before we destroy the 13th century and we can't plan to restore the universe

913
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,520
I understand

914
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,540
I'm going to go back

915
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:42,540
I'll always go to where you are

916
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,780
IKARI君...

917
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:46,440
Sorry...

918
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,620
IKARI君...

919
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:49,340
I was able to go to EVERA and I couldn't live without you

920
01:45:51,740 --> 01:46:03,540
I'm sorry, I'm

921
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,020
That's the most close number.

922
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:23,780
Yes.

923
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,940
The sync率 is the most powerful.

924
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:26,940
Here.

925
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,280
I'm going to change the hope of the Casius.

926
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,340
Stop it, father.

927
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:54,280
No, I'm not

928
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:54,760
going to be able to do something.

929
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,840
I'm going

930
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:50,520
to

931
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,800
You were here.

932
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,560
Everything started.

933
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:50,800
You see?

934
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:53,480
I'm so tired of

935
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:49,640
I don't know what the hell.

936
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,400
Ugh.

937
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,340
*Sigh*

938
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,360
The

939
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,760
End

940
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,160
I'm

941
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:41,100
not going to

942
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:55,620
I don't know.

943
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,840
I can't

944
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:47,920
*Many's

945
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:51,000
I want to talk to you

946
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,080
Father...

947
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:55,500
Father...

948
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,440
Father, what do you want to do here?

949
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:00,140
This Golgoda object is not possible.

950
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,260
It's an additional impact.

951
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,720
That's what I'm going to do with my own head.

952
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:11,220
I'm going to send you the last two of them here.

953
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:15,520
I think that the magic copy

954
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,440
I'm sure you

955
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:43,740
I'm sorry I'm sorry

956
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,880
I want to show you what you want.

957
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:51,100
This...

958
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:53,240
Black Rilis?

959
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:54,620
Is it what you remember?

960
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:58,380
Evangelion Imaginary.

961
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:02,280
The original one that you have predicted was that the original one had not been discovered.

962
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,720
It's an epic epic dream.

963
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,640
The human beings believe the reality and reality.

964
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:10,680
The human beings can only be recognized.

965
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:39,040
The fear and

966
01:55:46,040 --> 01:56:08,940
I'm the only

967
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:14,920
This is the additional impact?

968
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:18,860
Yes, I think it's an image of the ever-imaginary.

969
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:21,140
It's true to be true.

970
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:22,160
This is true!

971
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,260
It's true!

972
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:29,440
I'm not sure how much the light of the light is going to be.

973
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:35,280
Yes, I'm not a friend of mine. I'm not sure what I'm saying.

974
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:39,940
I always have a light that gives a hope.

975
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:43,620
But it's always a hope that I can die.

976
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,120
I'm too much too much for hope.

977
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:53,620
Gendou is the center of the center of

978
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:22,680
I've been so long for that, my name.

979
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,080
Now, let's go.

980
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:37,840
Yui, it's better.

981
01:58:48,380 --> 01:59:08,960
*Sounds of fire*

982
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:14,600
I'm moving! I'm not going to do this!

983
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:16,320
You're here,

984
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,500
But for the reason why I'm using this,

985
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,040
I'll be the best!

986
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:02,160
This is 8+9+10!

987
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:32,720
I got it

988
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:33,660
I'm going to go back to the 5th Capsel

989
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:38,640
I'm going back to the mainframe

990
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,320
I'm going to go back to the mainframe

991
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,860
This is my job now

992
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:43,820
How much is it?

993
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:52,160
The mainframe, we have to do a replacement

994
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:55,080
I think we can do it

995
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:55,660
I understand

996
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:58,600
We're going to the mainframe of the mainframe

997
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:02,720
We'll move forward to the mainframe

998
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,820
I'm sure I can't believe it.

999
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:08,040
And my responsibility is...

1000
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,060
I'm...

1001
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:13,320
I'll ask the children to live.

1002
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:18,340
I understand, Misato.

1003
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:20,200
I'll be the best.

1004
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:22,740
Thank you.

1005
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,560
Oh

1006
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:45,340
You be電磁力

1007
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,040
残ります

1008
02:01:46,740 --> 02:01:47,580
Yeah, I'm sorry

1009
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,740
You're not

1010
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,380
You're not

1011
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:54,060
It's a new engine.

1012
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:28,640
I'm not going to use you anymore.

1013
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:31,760
I'm going to sleep slowly, Adams.

1014
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:34,240
Wunder has moved.

1015
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:35,900
I'm going to hurry up.

1016
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:37,940
But...

1017
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:40,680
I'm going to be able to create the physical and mental.

1018
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:41,460
I'm going to be able to create the physical and mental.

1019
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:47,580
You...

1020
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:48,280
What are you doing?

1021
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:51,120
You

1022
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,700
don't have to choose the AT Field.

1023
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:57,940
The world is the world of human beings.

1024
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:00,300
No other people.

1025
02:03:01,930 --> 02:03:04,340
There are no harm, discrimination, conflict,

1026
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:24,440
Yui! Yui, where is it? Where is Yui?

1027
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:29,060
Everything is here, right? Where is it? Where is it?

1028
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:30,620
Yui!

1029
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:34,100
Father, let's stop now.

1030
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:37,520
Why? Why is Shinji here?

1031
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:39,120
I want to know what I want to know.

1032
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:44,180
Even though I was so sad, I was always close to my father.

1033
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,480
I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to kill you.

1034
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:54,320
But I want to know now...

1035
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,000
Father's voice...

1036
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:01,920
AT Field...

1037
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:04,420
This is me who left me...

1038
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:07,120
Is it...

1039
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:11,380
Is this...

1040
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,520
This

1041
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:30,960
is not to be able to

1042
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,520
But, with the coming of

1043
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:40,100
The world was not completely

1044
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:42,080
I was so sad

1045
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,660
One is knowledge.

1046
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:18,980
The knowledge of the only knowledge is filled with

1047
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:43,800
I love that system.

1048
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:46,240
I love you.

1049
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:17,660
I knew the first time I could have been a lonely person.

1050
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:22,140
I couldn't stop my feelings and lose my feelings.

1051
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:27,100
I wanted to cry with my heart.

1052
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:34,000
I wanted to change my feelings and change my feelings.

1053
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:37,840
I wanted to become a dream.

1054
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:45,120
I can't meet Yui with the weakness,

1055
02:07:45,600 --> 02:08:09,360
Shinji

1056
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:20,120
I'm not sure how

1057
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:24,040
to get out of here.

1058
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,680
*Ezio*

1059
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:54,020
"B

1060
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:17,900
It's time to

02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:39,820
I'm going to

1062
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:08,460
*Ezio

1063
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:28,000
Thank you, Izato.

1064
02:10:54,160 --> 02:11:10,520
I was thinking that I didn't meet my children, and I didn't

1065
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:30,380
I'm sorry, Shinji.

1066
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:33,240
That's right.

1067
02:11:34,230 --> 02:11:37,220
You were there, Yui?

1068
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:54,220
He is the center of the

1069
02:11:54,220 --> 02:12:17,760
"Horror

1070
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:17,760
of the

1071
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:23,080
I will take my father's attention, Asuka

1072
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:26,260
I don't know what he does

1073
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,220
He doesn't know what he does

1074
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:33,000
He doesn't need anyone, Asuka

1075
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:37,800
I'll make it easier to be a good person

1076
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:42,260
Because it's hard to do that

1077
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:48,280
Because it's hard to live

1078
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:51,120
I'm going to get to the Eva.

1079
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:19,020
I don't care if I can.

1080
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:21,000
I don't have any value of my life.

1081
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:27,040
I need to have a strong body and heart.

1082
02:13:28,530 --> 02:13:29,700
That's why I

1083
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,580
praise you.

1084
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:32,320
I recognize you.

1085
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:35,180
I give you a place to me.

1086
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,560
It's really sad.

1087
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,860
It's just that I wanted to be able to kiss you.

1088
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:02,880
That's

1089
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,600
fine.

1090
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:06,820
Asuka is Asuka.

1091
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:14,460
That means it's all about that

1092
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:23,220
I'm so sorry.

1093
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:24,760
I'm so sorry.

1094
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:25,920
I want to talk about you again.

1095
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,820
I want to share this with you.

1096
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:32,440
Thank you for saying that I like you.

1097
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:36,420
I also like Asuka.

1098
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:43,140
Bye, Asuka.

1099
02:14:44,210 --> 02:14:44,700
Please, Kensuke.

1100
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:47,100
"Hime, go to the end"

1101
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:48,040
"Hah!"

1102
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:57,840
"I've been told, Shinji-kun, you're not sad, right?"

1103
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:58,300
"Yes,

1104
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:02,720
I'm fine, now it's your turn, Kaoru-kun"

1105
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:09,460
"I've been thinking about this, I've been here, and I've been here, and I'm here."

1106
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:15,260
"I've been bringing my life to the name of my life, so I've been here."

1107
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,120
I'm the same. I'm the same.

1108
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:21,520
That's why I wanted to be a happy one.

1109
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:23,680
That's right.

1110
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:25,680
Kauru is like a father.

1111
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:28,460
That's why I was riding on the same boat.

1112
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:32,500
It's different from every time, Shinji.

1113
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:33,700
Do you cry?

1114
02:15:34,930 --> 02:15:35,220
Yes.

1115
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:37,080
I'm just gonna save my own eyes.

1116
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:42,740
If I'm not a person, I can't save anyone.

1117
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:45,120
So I'm not going to die

1118
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:48,040
That's

1119
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,800
I want to be happy.

1120
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:40,860
I want

1121
02:16:47,700 --> 02:17:01,179
I'm not sure what

1122
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:37,080
I mean, I

1123
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:43,240
think

1124
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:00,940
*Lighting*

1125
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:14,800
Yes.

1126
02:19:12,059 --> 02:19:13,240
-

1127
02:19:16,659 --> 02:19:19,460
Who's your friend?

1128
02:19:28,809 --> 02:19:29,160
Who?

1129
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:36,160
Aya波?

1130
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:38,559
No...

1131
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:40,420
That's

1132
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:40,719
right.

1133
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:48,219
I was always in my house, my mother.

1134
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:56,520
I finally understood.

1135
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:02,020
My father wanted to send my mother to me.

1136
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,900
That's what my father's wish.

1137
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,680
The murder of my father.

1138
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:37,600
*Sings*

1139
02:20:44,220 --> 02:20:45,620
I'm sorry,

1140
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:13,840
People are changing the way

1141
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:20,040
People are not aware

1142
02:21:21,530 --> 02:21:25,860
The first time is going to be gone

1143
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:28,360
How far is it far?

1144
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:35,960
I can't return to you

1145
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:52,080
I've met you and I've loved you

1146
02:21:54,780 --> 02:21:57,300
I will die until I die

1147
02:21:58,470 --> 02:22:01,460
I will not be proud

1148
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:05,360
I

1149
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:12,340
will not be able to die

1150
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:31,020
I have met you and I have loved you

1151
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:46,700
I will be proud to

1152
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:47,560
Oh

1153
02:23:13,899 --> 02:23:16,700
Good job

1154
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:21,940
Thank you.

1155
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:26,520
Thank you. 8+9+10+11+12.

1156
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:28,280
Thank you.

1157
02:23:29,530 --> 02:23:29,880
Thank you.

1158
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:30,820
The last Evangelion.

1159
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:56,060
Oh, you're

1160
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:28,200
Who's that?

1161
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:30,700
I'm a good girl with a big heart

1162
02:24:31,300 --> 02:24:32,940
I'm sorry

1163
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:41,600
It's a good smell to be a great taste

1164
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:42,120
It's a good smell to be a big smell

1165
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:48,420
You're so cute

1166
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:51,880
I'm like, "I'm going to hear you"

1167
02:24:59,020 --> 02:25:01,220
Let's go, Shinji.

1168
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:07,040
Let's go.

1169
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:07,360
Go!

1170
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:44,460
Can you give me one last kiss?

1171
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:50,280
I don't want to forget

1172
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:55,980
I don't want to forget

1173
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:05,620
I love you more than you'll ever know

1174
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:05,440
Oh

1175
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:36,000
Let's kiss,

1176
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,920
燃えるような kissもしよう

1177
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:44,720
忘れたくても

1178
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:48,320
忘れられないほど

1179
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:56,920
I love you more than your love, no

1180
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,600
I love you more than I love you now

1181
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:26,560
I know, I understand

1182
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:39,600
Even though I'm still a year

1183
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:12,600
I love you.

1184
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:32,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1185
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:38,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1186
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:48,220
Fui te ii ta, ka ze no ato oi kaketa, ma bushiikooko.

1187
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:42,620
I'm sorry.

1188
02:30:04,879 --> 02:30:07,680
Beautiful world

1189
02:31:03,939 --> 02:31:06,580
Beautiful boy

1190
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:16,680
もしも願い一つだけ

1191
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:20,100
叶うなら

1192
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:25,080
君のそばで眠らせて

1193
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:26,500
Don't know

1194
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:35,520
I'll see you next time.

1195
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,400
I'm so happy to be here.

1196
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:28,300
Oh beautiful

1197
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:31,160

1198
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:43,320
もしも願い一つだけ叶うなら

1199
02:33:46,979 --> 02:33:48,380
君のそばで眠らせて

1200
02:33:54,460 --> 02:33:57,540
It's only love

1201
02:34:02,739 --> 02:34:05,200
It's only love

1202
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:14,881
It's only love

1203
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:17,760
It's only love

1204
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:24,440
It's only love

Beautiful boy
