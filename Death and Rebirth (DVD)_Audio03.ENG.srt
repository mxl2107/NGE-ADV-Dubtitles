00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,760
Hi, my name is Amanda Wyn Lee.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,520
I wrote the script, I directed and produced the Evangelion movies,

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,480
and this is the commentary.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:12,500
Yay!

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,100
Hi, I'm Jason Lee.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,300
I was co-producer on the Evangelion movies,

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,520
and also I play the voice of Aoba.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,200
And I'm Taliesin Jaffe.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm a voice actor, General Eva Monkey,

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,840
and color commentary for this

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,160
commentary.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,980
- Oh yes, and I also played Ray and Yui.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,280
I forgot about that part.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,140
- They don't wanna know about that.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,380
- They don't

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,840
care about that.

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,320
- Not at all.

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,920
- No one cares about that.

19
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,740
And this is the section of 1001 Logos.

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,160
- Yeah,

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,340
apparently everybody but the Chrysler Corporation

22
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,800
was involved in the logo process here.

23
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,080
This is literally like two minutes of logos.

24
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,080
- It took a lot to get this film going.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,100
Apparently a lot of people wanted to be involved with it.

26
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,520
- Wow, we, on our end,

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,340
We know that this film takes a lot.

28
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,520
All right, let me just, a little disclaimer ahead of time here.

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,660
If there's a little levity on this commentary track, please forgive us, but this movie was

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,680
so intense and serious, we thought it was definitely necessary.

31
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,160
So Taliesin will be providing serious stuff, plenty of

32
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,640
that for all

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
of us, but you'll learn

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,720
a lot and you'll learn a bit about the dub process that we did.

35
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:30,120
Okay, I am especially proud of this opening scene because the dialogue was so hard to translate.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,580
We had three different translators working on this one scene until we got it line for line.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,360
The problem is there's three different conversations that are overlapping,

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,240
and so it's just

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,900
difficult

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,900
to pick out who is saying what.

41
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,240
But I was really proud of this. I thought we pretty much nailed this one.

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,180
Yeah, if you check out the subtitle also, you'll find that the three conversations going on right now, there's this, there's a

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,440
id

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,960
ego, super ego thing going on.

45
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,100
We have a pleasure center over on the left complaining about the food and about the smoking.

46
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,860
We've got the scientists trying to figure everything out.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,840
And we have Gendo as the super ego just laughing at everybody else trying to deal with this.

48
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,660
Wow, that's

49
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,340
pretty deep.

50
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,899
That is really deep, Taliesin.

51
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,160
We'll have

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,600
more of that.

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,980
I told you, Towson, we'll be the deep part of the commentary,

54
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,220
and I will be the superficial part,

55
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,300
and Amanda will be the...

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,080
Bubbly part.

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,240
Bubbly, nuts and bolts part of the whole deal.

58
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,660
But yeah, the opening sequence,

59
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,400
we literally had several translators working on it,

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,980
and even they were going,

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,960
there's too much stuff going on,

62
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,700
so we put them through their paces as well.

63
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,900
But I think we were very all happy the way it came out.

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm hoping English

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,360
audiences are going to get a lot more out of this than even the Japanese audiences did.

66
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,180
You can really pick out a lot more.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
Well, how the second impact just happened, and half the world dies now.

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,220
I hate it when that happens.

69
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,360
Now, it was interesting, with the sound design for this, our basic motto was,

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,260
if you don't feel the rumble in your rear end, then it doesn't count as an explosion.

71
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,600
So, Sean did an amazing job with the 5.1 surround mix.

72
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Sean being

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the sound mixer.

74
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,640
Sound god.

75
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,120
On the 5.1 mix, which I think we're also proud of the 5.1 mix.

76
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,140
Especially that opening sequence, you should have heard it coming from all kinds of places.

77
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,700
So, you could thank Sean for just the mastery of that.

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,480
If you didn't get that, you have to buy more expensive equipment right now.

79
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,860
Exactly.

80
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,120
Oh, before you

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,180
continue watching, go buy a 5.1.

82
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,260
If you do not have it, yes.

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,640
We won't come to your house, certainly not.

84
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:35,820
No.

85
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,040
This is

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,040
Alison Keith and Aaron Crone, both of whom I absolutely love and adore.

87
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,940
Alison Keith is a really, really good friend of mine.

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,620
She was actually in our wedding.

89
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,720
Yes, she was.

90
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,220
Wonderful actress.

91
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,740
She flew in from New York just to reprise the role of Miss Tato.

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,980
Did an

93
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,740
amazing job.

94
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,740
Do you want to talk about the bi-coastal, or it was bi-coastal, Gulf Coast and West Coast

95
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,480
difficulties

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,340
of doing this?

97
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,060
Getting all the actors in one place was very, very difficult.

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,140
We actually recorded in three different studios.

99
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:12,780
Oh,

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,739
just a quick note, this scene was actually in the original series,

101
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,079
but it was cut from the television broadcast.

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't have any stupid little kids.

103
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,340
My heart belongs to you, Kaji.

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,800
Mama! Mama! They chose me!

105
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,100
I'm an elite pilot now!

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm the best in the whole world!

107
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,220
There's a director's cut of the television series wandering around of Part 2.

108
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,380
And Asuka basically throws herself at Kaji, undoes her blouse,

109
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,980
says "Take me, take me, you wild, passionate thing."

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,720
And he says, "No!"

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
He's so cool.

112
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,120
I want to be him when I grow up.

113
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,580
And this is the wonderful Tiffany Grant...

114
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,020
...doing one of the most traumatizing scenes known to anime.

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,820
It's wonderful we introduce her at the hanging scene.

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,980
I need you to concentrate.

117
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,420
trying to.

119
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,140
There is Sue Uluas

120
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,780
Ritsko reprising her role.

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,260
What do you think it means,

122
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,580
ma'am?

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,860
That is Amy Seeley

124
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,640
doing the role of Ibuki.

125
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:13,940
Originally,

126
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,680
Kendra Spencer did the role.

127
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,840
She was not available and basically deferred and said,

128
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,100
you know what, find somebody that could do this justice,

129
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,640
and I think we did.

130
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,140
Absolutely. Amy Seeley

131
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,600
is amazing.

132
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,920
Oh, this is Tristan McAvery does Gendo.

133
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,960
Wonderful, wonderful job with Gendo.

134
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,160
And Lauren Chapman was Dr. Akagi.

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,000
And of course,

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Spike

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,820
Spencer.

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,000
And we haven't heard from Ray yet, have we?

139
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,420
No?

140
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,300
Nope.

141
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,040
She comes a little longer.

142
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,720
The effort, though, getting all these actors and studios together for the...

143
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,580
Basically, we did part of In Texas to try to get as much of the original cast as we

144
00:05:59,580 --> 00:05:59,940
could.

145
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,940
And a lot of them still live in Texas, where ADV did the original series.

146
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,240
And then a lot of the actors lived in Los Angeles,

147
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,640
so we did all the mixing and sound and all that stuff as well.

148
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,920
It was a bi-coastal production.

149
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,260
It was a

150
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,080
bi-coastal production.

151
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,320
And I don't think we'll ever do it again, but it was...

152
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,240
It was a wonderful learning experience.

153
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,900
Oh, there went Ray.

154
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,080
She went...

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
Her first gasps.

156
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,300
and Shinji's immortal words here,

157
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,040
which will run through the rest of the series.

158
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,700
Ready? Here it goes.

159
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,640
Do it, do it, do it.

160
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,760
I must have run away. I must have run away.

161
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,740
I must have run away.

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,800
Yay!

163
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,720
A lot of kanji in the--

164
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,500
Boy, all over the place in this

165
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:49,980
and--

166
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,620
Especially in death.

167
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:50,840
In

168
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,440
death.

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,620
Now, this actually--

170
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,120
Aaron Crone also did the voice of Kwaru for this

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,900
brilliant job I think

172
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,400
personally

173
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,060
I'll

174
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,540
second that one there the

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,300
original actor

176
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,620
Kyle Sturdivant was unavailable we had a hard time finding some of these guys

177
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,340
they just kind of disappeared off the face of the earth but Aaron I mean you

178
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,160
would he just did a wonderful job if not mimicking taking this to a level I mean

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,120
the original guy did a wonderful job but Aaron just I mean I just felt this

180
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,120
just, Kwaru's humanity just pour through his performance in this. It was pretty amazing.

181
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,120
She really

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,880
did a brilliant job.

183
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,840
And we set up for the frame of this entire film, which is this practice at the school

184
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,080
with all of our children, the first children, the second children, a third child. We're in English now.

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,640
That's right.

186
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,220
In the original Japanese, they call it the first children instead of the first child.

187
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,860
second children, third children.

188
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,060
So for those of you who wanted us to remain absolutely hardcore faithful to the original Japanese,

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,340
I'm sorry, but that just would have sounded stupid.

190
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,060
Yeah,

191
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,380
most WordPerfect spell checks are intelligent enough to change this.

192
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,580
You kind of got to go with WordPerfect occasionally.

193
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,760
What was the artistry of moving the, like, the Evangelion was backwards.

194
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,400
Was that just kind of a funky, artsy thing?

195
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,760
I think it's the Evangelion was backwards for death and then for rebirth.

196
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,060
Because we are kind of re-seeing...

197
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,640
You want a moment of fun here?

198
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,920
There's a definite Christ metaphor for anybody who has watched the show...

199
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,700
...and we have Shinji kind of stuck in here.

200
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,360
And crucifixion, it's not just a Catholic thing.

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
It goes through various, various religions.

202
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,780
And it's all about going into death, looking at death and coming out of it again...

203
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,840
...and seeing where you come from afterwards.

204
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,780
That's really what's happening here.

205
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,800
And this is really what is going on on that level of this film.

206
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,620
So it's about going into something and coming out of it again. It's a trial.

207
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,460
That's cool.

208
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,340
Well, thank

209
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,440
you.

210
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,040
Removing primary restraints.

211
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,880
Removing secondary restraints.

212
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Roger.

213
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,500
Now we go into our first Eva angel attack.

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,360
Eva, launch!

215
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:10,280
Oh, it was funny. The original series that they sent us,

216
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,100
the sounds of the original series, did not have any of the Eva monster noises.

217
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,340
So, Taliesin and Jason actually got into the studio and made all the other noises.

218
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
As well as the angels.

219
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,920
As well as the angels.

220
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,820
Except for one specific one. We'll see later.

221
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,960
We'll get to that one now.

222
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,900
So, now this first one is you, isn't it, Taliesin?

223
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,220
Yes, I am Satyel, the angel of water.

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,000
And angel of Thursdays, which is odd, because I can never quite get the hang of Thursdays.

225
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,800
We're having trouble maintaining activation!

226
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,080
This kind of cerebrum feel to it with the bird face

227
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,460
and kind of the shape of a lot of the original drawings

228
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,760
of the six wings and strange multiple heads of angels

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,520
that they had before they got cute and fluffy.

230
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,200
Was this you, Taliesin, or was it? I can't remember.

231
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,120
No, that one was Taliesin.

232
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,700
I guess that one was me still. We switched off a bit.

233
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,100
Our voice would give out and somebody else would

234
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,660
come in to

235
00:09:59,660 --> 00:09:59,900
take

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,380
its place.

237
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,500
Yeah, it was quite interesting doing all the ava noises.

238
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,900
Then we would pitch them, of course.

239
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,120
And then we put this effect on it called grumpy flutter, which I just loved.

240
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,120
Please compare between the Japanese and the English rule.

241
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,280
We want you to hear what we did for this.

242
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,200
Personally,

243
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm really proud of what we did.

244
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,380
I thought, see, now that was a Jason growl.

245
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,120
That one I recognize.

246
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm not capable of that.

247
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,420
And I don't know if you went into depth about it,

248
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,680
but we just didn't have the...

249
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,940
A lot of times, say, the Ava noises would be on the M&E track,

250
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,540
music and effects track and this happened to be on the dialogue track of the Japanese which

251
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:49,020
we couldn't separate for the 5.1 to clean sound so that's why we recreated it. It wasn't

252
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,800
an artistic choice on our part, it was a necessity that we had to do it.

253
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,540
Yes, which we did just, we managed to pull that together which it was kind of fun and

254
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,120
we got creative with some of the stranger

255
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,940
angels.

256
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,880
He did actually, by the way, just pierce the soul of that angel with a rib.

257
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,860
I don't know what that means.

258
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,420
Is

259
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,780
that some sort of, yeah, something Adam-esque.

260
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,160
There might

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,840
be something there.

262
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,160
I'm not sure.

263
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,980
There could be.

264
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,140
Maybe he just likes spare ribs.

265
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,980
Angels taste like chicken.

266
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,320
Angels taste like chicken.

267
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,780
Is that true?

268
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:20,940
Very true.

269
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,340
Fabulous.

270
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,540
And what you'll find, oddly enough, is Masato's apartment is an exact replica of Amanda.

271
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,540
We have this exact same apartment.

272
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,140
It's very strange.

273
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,980
Other than the Krispy Kreme thing, yeah, it's

274
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,880
just down there.

275
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,900
And she doesn't have a Space Invaders machine.

276
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,140
And if you caught,

277
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,440
Miss Alda did just move in also, if you caught that too.

278
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,480
She moved in yesterday,

279
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,160
I think she

280
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,280
says.

281
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,720
That's why it looks exactly like our apartment at this point.

282
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,700
Fantastic.

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Wish I could destroy apartment that quickly.

284
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,100
Now this is a flashback,

285
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,280
and we actually have Mike Ross

286
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,580
doing the voice of Hugheski.

287
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,420
We were unable to find Gil Lundy.

288
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,200
He's

289
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,840
one of those actors

290
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,580
that just disappeared

291
00:11:59,610 --> 00:11:59,840
off the

292
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,360
face of the earth.

293
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,420
But once

294
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,300
again, Mike Ross stepped up to the role.

295
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,900
He studied it so thoroughly before he even got in the studio that I think he did a really wonderful job.

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,980
I was very impressed.

297
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,000
This

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,080
next sequence, this kind of flashback, is kind of one of my favorites because Masato gets a little tipsy and Allison's a lot of fun.

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,840
It comes up in a couple of minutes here.

300
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,560
We laughed quite a bit doing the mix on this because there's so many voices layered, especially in this part.

301
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,200
Some of the most fun lines we buried, especially when they show up in the bar here in a second.

302
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,460
This was an interesting thing because even though these are scenes from the original production,

303
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,720
this being a manga production, we had to recreate every single bit of dialogue.

304
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,380
So this exchange with Shinji, even though this is layered down, we had to totally redo this again.

305
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,960
Which, fan service, which

306
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,559
is...

307
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,860
She has one of those heart-shaped tinies.

308
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes.

309
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
You guys like that kind of thing, huh?

310
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm not allowed to talk about being attracted to any cartoon.

311
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,720
My therapist has advised me to

312
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,900
stop anything like

313
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,080
that.

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,520
And on that note...

315
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,520
Yes, no...

316
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:16,700
So

317
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:24,500
now this is Spike Spencer, who actually in real life is one of the most hyper, funniest, you know, just sweetest guys I know.

318
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,800
So it's funny.

319
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,300
I hope that Manka gets to put the outtakes

320
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,120
on

321
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,440
the DVDs,

322
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,080
but Spike would just have so much fun in the studio

323
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,800
that we just loved listening to him and just loved playing with him.

324
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,120
Spike

325
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,580
is a very, very talented actor.

326
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,980
The outtakes, especially after working on a show like this

327
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,620
after a couple weeks, a couple months...

328
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
We get pretty punchy.

329
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,740
You need to laugh at something after a while.

330
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,760
Because it's just... Life gets very gray.

331
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,660
Life gets very gray.

332
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,260
Once again, excuse our levity, but we really...

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,040
I mean, if we did not act like this in the studio when we were making this,

334
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,440
it would have been a...

335
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,320
We would have all thrown ourselves in front of a bus or opened

336
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,780
a vein

337
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,660
or something comparable.

338
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,180
We would have shaved our body.

339
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,660
There's Martin, get away!

340
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,760
This is Shamahel, by the way, Angel of the Sun.

341
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,820
The hierarchy of angels is pretty mixed

342
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,360
in

343
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:28,900
Catholicism.

344
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,620
They can't really...

345
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,320
No one can really decide how many there are, what they do.

346
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,020
They don't even know who the archangels are.

347
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
There's supposed to be seven of them, but there's like 30 that have the title.

348
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,900
That one just happens to look like a giant sea anemone,

349
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,980
something that I would eat if I were in Japan.

350
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,020
Well, no, even if it were 40-story style.

351
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
One of the stranger

352
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,440
of the angel designs.

353
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,160
I never quite could trace it to anything.

354
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,760
There's one that I always think, I always call it the Picasso painting,

355
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,020
the one that was the big eyeball that drips acid.

356
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,960
I love the big eyeball that drips acid. That's

357
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,360
so wonderful.

358
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,100
I call it the Picasso angel.

359
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,640
We

360
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,740
don't get much of it in this film.

361
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,180
I think

362
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,680
there's like a brief two-second, two-frame flash or something.

363
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,880
Yeah, there's 17, 15 angels in all,

364
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,680
and we will be making little notes about all of them at some point in this audio commentary.

365
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,820
A lot of them come from, those images do come from places,

366
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,720
and a lot of them are just...

367
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,560
Probably do, but I'm only one man.

368
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,240
There's only so much I can do in 48 hours' notice.

369
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,880
So here's Shinji Stalking.

370
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,280
We're about to hear Kurt Stoll.

371
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:35,940
We love

372
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,440
Kurt Stoll.

373
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,740
We love

374
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,220
Kurt Stoll.

375
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,740
You've heard him in primarily many ADV productions,

376
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,400
but he has this wonderful young fighter pilot-type voice

377
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,260
that we just love, Kurt Stoll,

378
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,520
and we're glad we could bring him back to recreate this role.

379
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,380
He's just got this,

380
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,640
I

381
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,940
don't know, just this youth and vibrancy to his voice.

382
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
He's like, but I can play older roles.

383
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,920
We're like, yes, Kurt, we know, but

384
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,620
we love you in these Luke Skywalker-type roles.

385
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:02,980
Totally.

386
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,320
They were cooking rice the old-fashioned way, by the way.

387
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,700
That little canister, that's the Japanese outdoor.

388
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,140
That's

389
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,760
the camp cooking.

390
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,520
That's camp cooking.

391
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,300
Potatoes and tinfoil.

392
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,400
Have a Japanese Coleman stove.

393
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,520
More or less.

394
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,140
Oh, God.

395
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay, nerve.

396
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,320
There's something to talk about.

397
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,480
The fig leaf is obvious to anybody.

398
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,080
God's in his heavens, all's right with the world

399
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,200
is from Pippa Passes by Robert Browning,

400
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,880
a 19th century English poet.

401
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,060
Read it yourself, figure out what it means.

402
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,080
I'm not giving anybody anything on that.

403
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,680
I'm trying to get you to buy books.

404
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,740
I'm not letting you just purge mine here.

405
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,180
It's a very, very fluffy poem about springtime and birds.

406
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,720
It's funny that they took such a fluffy poem and made it symbolize this

407
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,040
It's a thing of such evil.

408
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,120
Dark, powerful,

409
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,860
heinous force.

410
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,200
Of course,

411
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,000
if you're leaving, we'll have to leave.

412
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,160
Now

413
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,340
this is Brett Weaver.

414
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,400
He was one of the three original Tojis.

415
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,319
He was kind of like Lionel from the Jeffersons.

416
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,640
He was the third Lionel, or third Toji.

417
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,560
And we wish we had more for him to do, but Toji in the flashbacks,

418
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,720
We, uh, not too much, but he did a great job once again.

419
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,400
Shinji, you mustn't run away.

420
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,959
You breed them out in a farm on Fresno, right?

421
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,220
The toji farm, huh?

422
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,800
Yeah, tojis

423
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
are bred often for

424
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,180
sports.

425
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,100
Tojis and rays. Tojis and

426
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,220
rays.

427
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,660
Oh, my?

428
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,460
Oh, my.

429
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,200
Some of the oddness.

430
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,160
It's awesome! The buildings

431
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,780
are growing!

432
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,860
Just

433
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,380
like the little man in my pants.

434
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,520
Sorry.

435
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,080
I was wondering how

436
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,420
long it went before we went that direction.

437
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,720
Pay no

438
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,460
attention to the phallic metaphor of Man's Hubris here.

439
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,060
Titanic will not sink, Tokyo 3 will not fall.

440
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,740
Oddly enough, they do capture the look of

441
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,180
Tokyo

442
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,200
pretty well.

443
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,320
What I would imagine Tokyo would look like if they had to start over again.

444
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
The trains and the...

445
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,280
Except there weren't a million people scrunched on the

446
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,520
train

447
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:10,740
together.

448
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,920
And they didn't have the guy doing the Marlon Brando voice on the train.

449
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Often on the Tokyo subways, not speaking Japanese well at all,

450
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,480
we don't know what the guy's saying as he's announcing the stops,

451
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,920
but every Tokyo subway train driver sounds like Marlon Brando for some reason,

452
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,840
and we're not quite sure why.

453
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
This is a coveted job in Japan, no less.

454
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,580
People want to be train drivers, and then they just sound so sad.

455
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,020
We believe that mental

456
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,220
illness is lost.

457
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,120
Calling Shinjuku next time.

458
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,740
Causing a strain on the third child's health.

459
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,100
He was given four days leave.

460
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,580
His status has returned to normal.

461
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,680
Enjoy this.

462
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,780
This is a shiny, happy Shinji.

463
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,560
This is the last time you'll ever see it again.

464
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm home.

465
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,040
Welcome

466
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,380
home.

467
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,460
And now we move on to our next character.

468
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,720
Yay!

469
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,640
This is the inimitable Tiffany Grant,

470
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,280
reprising her role as Asuka.

471
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,200
The feisty redhead.

472
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,880
All you have to do is play arpeggios.

473
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,800
Also known as the archetypal ex-girlfriend.

474
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:27,540
Many fans at the convention say that all the girls they go to school with remind them of Asuka.

475
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,420
Okay, wait, I just have to tell you guys that thing where Pen Pen was snoring, I did that.

476
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,820
Amanda did do the...

477
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,200
Is that quite a voice or what would you call that?

478
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,440
No, I call that a voice. I make my living off of animal voices.

479
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,960
That's real work right there.

480
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,160
So that's what a penguin sounds like when it's snoring.

481
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,980
Oh, this is when Shinji tries to get some.

482
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,800
I love the way his eyes bug out.

483
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,040
Her tits

484
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,940
are bigger there.

485
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,000
They're actually...

486
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,140
I was just going to say,

487
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,260
her breasts deflate as the series goes on.

488
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,880
And obviously this is the metaphor.

489
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,520
His dat tape is out of control.

490
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,680
It's going fast.

491
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,180
It's racing.

492
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,980
And then we come to the...

493
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,060
You

494
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,380
know, I...

495
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,480
That teenage first kiss is such a nightmare.

496
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,100
Oh, God.

497
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,720
Oh, yeah.

498
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,580
My teenage first kiss, I got mono.

499
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm

500
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,540
totally

501
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,860
serious.

502
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,700
I was sick with mono for like two years.

503
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,880
Wow, you beat Shinji there.

504
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,140
Her worst first

505
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,800
teenage kiss.

506
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,280
call me mama, so that's...

507
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,060
What is the significance of the hick music here,

508
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,360
the kind of the hillbilly...

509
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:44,900
It's their way

510
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,940
of having fun.

511
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,460
Yeah, a lot of this music,

512
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,800
at least at the beginning of the series,

513
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,920
really harkened back to the classic animes of 1970s,

514
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,580
the Gundam stuff,

515
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,300
and there was a real feel of a typical anime giant robot show,

516
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,780
and it just slowly breaks down episode by episode

517
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,700
into this...

518
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,420
This is like the Country Bear Jamboree soundtrack

519
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
playing right here for some reason,

520
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,520
and

521
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,480
we'll call it Oscar's

522
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,720
lament

523
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,500
from now on.

524
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,580
I think that

525
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,000
the

526
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,280
music budget was really limited too

527
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,840
because these same pieces of music

528
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,860
can get used over and over and over and over again.

529
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,500
I think we've got the done, done, done, done background.

530
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,540
We've got the one piece of classical music

531
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,780
they optioned for much of the...

532
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,280
Well, there's lots of...

533
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,980
There's three classical

534
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,060
pieces.

535
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,540
The Ode to Joy.

536
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,060
The Ode to

537
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,240
Joy,

538
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,760
Canon,

539
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,240
Pocabell's Canon,

540
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,560
and Hallelujah.

541
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,200
Hallelujah of course.

542
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,040
I just have to tell you guys, I love Spike Spencer so much,

543
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,580
he could not say Paco Bell's Canon.

544
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,360
Paco Bell.

545
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,640
And so...

546
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,560
Taco Bell's Canon.

547
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,240
Taco Bell's Canon.

548
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,220
So he said it like, we did that tech like 15 times,

549
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,260
and sweet, sweet boy, but just somehow it just kept

550
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,880
catching in his throat, or just not quite coming out of his mouth.

551
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,960
These movie soundtracks are really worthwhile

552
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,760
picking up if you're a classical music fan,

553
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,220
and Canon, despite being associated with Alcoholics Anonymous

554
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,940
and forever because of

555
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,040
that.

556
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,480
It's a great

557
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,040
piece of music,

558
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,840
even though everyone plays it way too slow.

559
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,260
It's actually supposed to be a much faster

560
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,320
version.

561
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
Yeah, actually, when we would turn on the ending credits

562
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,940
to double speed, I would always watch it double speed

563
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,940
because that's the actual tempo.

564
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,560
Really?

565
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,120
No one plays it that way.

566
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,720
Wait, why is that associated with Alcoholics Anonymous?

567
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,000
Because it

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
was their theme song through most of the 80s.

569
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, was it?

570
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah,

571
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,780
I lost my wife, my job.

572
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,700
What a waste.

573
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,380
Yeah.

574
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,460
What a beautiful song.

575
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,180
I mean, not that, oh, wow.

576
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,020
God, now I'm

577
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,860
going to get angry letters.

578
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,880
No, I mean, Alcoholics Anonymous is a fabulous association,

579
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,620
but it's

580
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
such a great song to have to...

581
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
If you don't stop, we're going to have to stop tape.

582
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
I know. Okay, I'm done.

583
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,000
We'll talk quickly about this whale of an angel

584
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,380
that we have coming down here.

585
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,580
This is, oh, yes, this is our next angel,

586
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,000
the angel of fish, Skagiel,

587
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,760
appropriately.

588
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,040
Angel of fish.

589
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,120
I suppose fish named an angel.

590
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,540
kind of whale-like

591
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,620
more interesting in the fact that

592
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,200
it's our first introduction to

593
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,800
the brand of butt-kicking

594
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,480
that is Asuka

595
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,620
who also has a very interesting

596
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,400
Eva, she has the production model Eva

597
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,620
which if you're up on your

598
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Babylonian mythology, which I know all of you are

599
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,840
which I'm obviously not

600
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,100
because I'm checking my notes right now

601
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,740
is very closely associated

602
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,220
with Corazon and Marduk

603
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,400
who again you'll have to look up as an interesting Babylonian god.

604
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,660
Four eyes.

605
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,420
Marduk, four eyes, four ears and two mouths.

606
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,100
Son of Ishtar.

607
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,340
It's kind of the Babylonian equivalent of the Christ birth.

608
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,500
He was the

609
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,540
Jesus son.

610
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,220
Eventually of course becoming a demon in Christian folklore.

611
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,700
It was a four-eyed...

612
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,340
Well that's what happens when your religion goes out of style.

613
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,900
That's the unfortunate thing.

614
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,540
So that's

615
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,940
interesting, though, that they fashioned one of the Evas after that,

616
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,180
and then they also referred to the

617
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,680
Marduk report.

618
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,500
Yeah, the Marduk report, which has some interesting stuff going on there.

619
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,680
That was the big dog, right?

620
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,280
Yeah, that

621
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,700
was Marmaduke.

622
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,540
That was Marmaduke.

623
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:21,720
I

624
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,320
almost said Marmalade.

625
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,900
That's my fault.

626
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,260
I'm sorry.

627
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,300
Another big red dog associated with Babylonian mythology.

628
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,440
Hello.

629
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,380
Good morning, Shinji.

630
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,720
Once again, we have the...

631
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,720
The Asuka's lament.

632
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,540
Picking and grinning.

633
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,520
Somebody in Japan, I was in Japan when this film came out,

634
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,120
and somebody was talking to me about the relationship between Asuka and Shinji

635
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:53,200
and how it related to, of all things, the wall, the destruction of Jericho, Joshua and Jericho.

636
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,100
I have absolutely no idea what that means, but if you figure it out, please find me at a convention,

637
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,320
because this man did not speak very good English

638
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,660
and was attempting to explain this to me.

639
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,760
It's something worth taking a look at, though,

640
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,880
because he felt very strongly about it,

641
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,940
and he had a good book collection.

642
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,220
Now, do you think that they portray Asuka

643
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,360
as coming from this kind of land

644
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,480
that's not as sophisticated as they come from?

645
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,160
Anywhere but Japan?

646
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,220
Definitely.

647
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,560
I didn't know if the music was...

648
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,140
It's the rest

649
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,900
of the world there.

650
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,060
I love this animation here where Asuka gets really mad,

651
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,899
and that's my favorite...

652
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:33,180
I love the fact that Shinji face plants right into the middle of the mat.

653
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,140
That just cracks me up.

654
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,300
Not only that, but I don't know if everyone notices that Asuka's actually the one that messed up,

655
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,740
and then Shinji messes up.

656
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,940
But she blames it on him.

657
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,200
This is them preparing for the fight with Israfel,

658
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,860
twin angels of poetry and music, Ko and Otsu,

659
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,780
which I've never quite been able to find anywhere.

660
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,680
It's something Japanese.

661
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,640
Little yin-yang angel you don't really get to see much in this...

662
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,760
in this encapsulated version.

663
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,920
This non-linear flashback that we're going through.

664
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,640
So with the hanging doll that we just saw,

665
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,120
that portrays the death of her youth, you think, maybe?

666
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,680
Or her innocence?

667
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,640
Um, there's...

668
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,100
The death of the popularity

669
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,060
of Cabbage Patch Kids.

670
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,520
Somewhere Raggedy Andy is very upset.

671
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,700
And a bachelor again.

672
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,380
He's going, why? Why?

673
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,420
Yeah, Asuka is definitely the most, probably the most scarred of the kids, just because

674
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,060
she doesn't talk about it nearly as much.

675
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,360
This is obviously the long elevator sequence that...

676
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,000
The sequence from...

677
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,740
No expense was spared in the making of this film.

678
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,500
This sequence, oh yeah.

679
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,380
Wait, wait,

680
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,360
she's going to twitch.

681
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,240
Any minute now, she twitches and then shifts.

682
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,640
Unless she already did it.

683
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,260
You know, they could have played Girl from Impanima, at least at this point.

684
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,480
Just to kind

685
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,780
of...

686
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:48,880
See,

687
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,360
there it was.

688
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,180
She twitched.

689
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,980
This is a slow burn.

690
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,780
This is like a minute and 45 seconds of just two chicks in an elevator.

691
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,120
It's

692
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,580
Anno and Oshia, the two Japanese animation directors who just feel that you can't stare at a puppy dog for too long in any film.

693
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,740
Oh, look, there's a broken statue.

694
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,200
I think we have to take 25, 30 seconds at least to absorb that.

695
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,100
Oh, there she spoke.

696
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:11,620
Okay.

697
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,620
And we break our tension with our two

698
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,000
characters.

699
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,580
That's

700
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,240
a great haircut.

701
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,700
phrase.

702
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,560
The baby Thurman?

703
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:24,900
Yeah.

704
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,460
A friend who got her hair cut like that once.

705
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,420
And

706
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,520
so here's Asuka having a little

707
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,180
hissy fit.

708
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:37,960
Yeah.

709
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,220
Poor Asuka.

710
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,280
They go into a bit of her parents

711
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
and the neglect and her desperate

712
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,380
need to show off.

713
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,320
The doll, of course, was her doll.

714
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,700
Well, that was the doll that the mother believed after the mother...

715
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,880
After the first contact experiment with Unit 2,

716
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,500
the mother went insane and believed that the doll was actually her daughter

717
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,080
and believed that Asuka was this strange, weird girl.

718
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,980
So she would talk and coo to this doll.

719
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
And then when she hung herself, she also hung the doll.

720
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,580
Like taking her baby with her.

721
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,380
And they let this girl

722
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,480
pilot them, Eva.

723
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,060
I know.

724
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,540
This is a fun sequence with Kurt and Brett doing Toji and...

725
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,640
Oh, come on.

726
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,460
We saw you looking.

727
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,240
It's good.

728
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,840
Got Ray's

729
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,500
mammaries.

730
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,060
Ray's silky

731
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,500
thighs.

732
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,760
Kurt Cass.

733
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,760
I love... Kurt

734
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,100
stole Foley.

735
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,520
Naughty bits. That's just funny.

736
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,360
It's just awesome.

737
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,460
Then

738
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,620
just what were you looking at?

739
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,680
Yeah, come on.

740
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,420
Teenage boys.

741
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,160
I was just wondering why she's always...

742
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,580
And then we have

743
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:44,820
a little

744
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,080
Unit Zero action.

745
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,620
Pre-blue Unit Zero.

746
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,040
It changes colors. They decided that the yellow was in

747
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,260
bad taste.

748
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,220
Well, that's when they rebuilt it.

749
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,620
They decided yellow

750
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,700
was way out.

751
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,780
It was clashing with their

752
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,040
hair.

753
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,240
So

754
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,560
last year.

755
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,900
Well, I think they had found a spare part,

756
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,200
and, you know, it was out of a junkyard or something,

757
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,080
so the colors didn't match, so they kind of had to make it.

758
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,400
It was clashing with the S2 engine.

759
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,260
Yeah, exactly.

760
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,240
It looked too ghetto just to leave it.

761
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,160
Yeah, they took

762
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,040
it to Earl Scheib, and, you know, he did a good job, I thought.

763
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,840
And now we get into everybody's favorite clone,

764
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,980
and everybody's favorite clone,

765
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,460
and everybody's favorite clone.

766
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,400
Oh, in my apartment.

767
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,800
Out of my

768
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,220
apartment.

769
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:35,960
Rey,

770
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,700
Rey, Rey.

771
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,400
Do you have anything to say about Rey?

772
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,500
This is probably my favorite scene

773
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,600
because it's so wrong.

774
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
So, so, so wrong.

775
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,700
Shinji cops a feel on his mom.

776
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,500
That's just, that's not

777
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,720
nice.

778
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,100
But we don't really know that at the point that this scene takes place in the series,

779
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,860
so it's not as wrong on the first watch as it

780
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,360
is in retrospect.

781
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,780
I think it rates slightly higher than the Skywalker Leia kiss,

782
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,860
as that kind of ew that later after thought, oh.

783
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,280
Yeah.

784
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,460
That, ooh, didn't they suck face?

785
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,900
Isn't that just evil?

786
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,660
So we have our first strains of edifice issues in this...

787
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,940
...strange, dark, dark world that they're creating.

788
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,900
Oh, oh.

789
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,260
And they find a way to get all the lingerie in the scene as well, which is great.

790
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,240
You can never have too many panties in one scene.

791
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,620
I like the bra precariously

792
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,900
balanced on his buttock.

793
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,160
On his pointy buttock.

794
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,280
Never before has so much underwear been in one anime.

795
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,540
And that says, in one shot, that says a lot.

796
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,360
We see the few of Ray's possessions.

797
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,020
Other than a massive collection of underwear,

798
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,380
she owns one pair of glasses that she can't wear,

799
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,520
a cup of water, and some bloodied bandages,

800
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,100
and 50 pieces of

801
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,540
underwear.

802
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,820
We know what her priorities are.

803
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,160
Well, in the director's cut, you do see

804
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
a different angle

805
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,740
where you see her whole Beanie Baby collection

806
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,620
on the other wall,

807
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,080
which I thought would have added a level of humanity that we missed.

808
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,260
And her I love Sean Cassidy poster.

809
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,340
Yeah,

810
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,240
it was...

811
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,880
Which is why you need an R2 DVD player.

812
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,700
That's right.

813
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,100
This is all that you miss.

814
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,620
Well, I was

815
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,760
asked to, you

816
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:16,880
know...

817
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,380
That's okay.

818
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,420
No one's listening to us right now.

819
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,480
They're just trying to see if they can see Ray.

820
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,240
It's naughty bits.

821
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,360
Random Ray tidbits.

822
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,920
When we first saw the show, me and kind of my Scooby gang with the big scary books,

823
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,440
we were thinking Ray was kind of a symbol for the angelic choir,

824
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,540
but then this film happened and changed our whole theory on what was going on with her

825
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,200
because there's just so many of her.

826
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,620
And we have baby Ray, we have teenage Ray, and then we have our third and final Ray.

827
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,580
Then there's the Uber Ray in the end.

828
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,540
There's Uber Ray later.

829
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,520
Yeah, no triple goddess metaphor there.

830
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,260
I'm not even going to go

831
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,700
into that.

832
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,560
You can do that on your own.

833
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,620
Is that like a father, son, Holy Spirit thing, but with boobs?

834
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,400
Yeah, well, you know.

835
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:56,660
I'm

836
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,600
so going to get hate mail.

837
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,360
No,

838
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,220
of course not.

839
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,760
Find somebody in an all-natural cotton shirt and ask them.

840
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,780
They'll fill you in.

841
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm going to share in your head now.

842
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,420
Wow.

843
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:08,900
Yeah.

844
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,280
This was interesting.

845
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:15,400
This was a scene that they took from the original series.

846
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,700
But the animation is different,

847
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,300
so I don't know if this was an alternate take of the scene

848
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,700
or if they couldn't find the original animation

849
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,980
and just decided to redo it.

850
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,960
Well, they did reanimate a lot of little things.

851
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,400
A lot with Rey, actually.

852
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,240
If you notice in the very opening of this film,

853
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,660
when Rey's on the ground,

854
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,260
the very first thing with the Eva shaking

855
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,520
and the first angel attack with Shinji.

856
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,180
There's one shot that's very well animated of her heaving.

857
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,740
She's doing this kind of heave.

858
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,120
That's new animation.

859
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,120
And also the shot of her when he rescues her from the pod

860
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,920
and amended his brand new animation for this film.

861
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,760
Oh, really?

862
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,240
Yeah, it's like seven or eight seconds worth of all new animation.

863
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,300
I thought it was the same.

864
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I mean, it looked like the same.

865
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,240
A little cleaner.

866
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,060
A little cleaner.

867
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,340
Nice.

868
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,640
Very nice.

869
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,500
It's odd, man.

870
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,400
I don't want to.

871
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,540
I don't want to go through it again.

872
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,900
This is one of these scenes where Spike is a very, very active person

873
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,060
And the fact that this character Shinji was so passive would get to him sometimes

874
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,020
So we'd have to make sure that it didn't sound like he was whining too much

875
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,420
Lip flap's impeccable, though

876
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,000
Well, thank you

877
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,440
Down to the millisecond

878
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,260
Oh, dear

879
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:29,820
This is when

880
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,740
Rey gets mad

881
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,920
No, Rey doesn't look mad

882
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,539
Ever goes insane

883
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:42,880
It looks like the Eva is going for somebody, and it's a worthwhile debate to say, is it Ritsuko or is it Gendo that it was first punching at?

884
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,900
Who was it angry at?

885
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,760
We don't know. I don't know.

886
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,680
I don't know either.

887
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,980
There's a lot of thought to that. There has to be some personality in that Eva.

888
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,460
There's a couple different good ideas on who it could be.

889
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah.

890
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,680
Who do we have?

891
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,820
It's a

892
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,260
pot.

893
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,420
I

894
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,240
love this conversation.

895
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,380
This bit of dialogue. I don't know why.

896
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,740
I mean, it's so...

897
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,480
...opaque.

898
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,560
For some reason, I've always thought it was a beautiful exchange.

899
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,120
I

900
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,720
think it defines their relationship.

901
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,440
It's this really intimate relationship held at arm's length, basically.

902
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,100
And they just don't know how to talk to each other even though they want to.

903
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:29,580
and

904
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,940
we

905
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,980
find because he's

906
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,960
talking to his mother,

907
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,620
but not in a mother-son relationship.

908
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,379
So it's such an odd dynamic, I think.

909
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,139
She doesn't really know.

910
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,820
She doesn't have those type of feelings towards...

911
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,060
It's just a strange dynamic,

912
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,560
and I think it's always a neat exchange between the two.

913
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,480
She's definitely not emotionally mature enough yet

914
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,060
to really figure out what's going on between her and him there.

915
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,100
And it's also added to the fact that the writer of this film

916
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,980
is a master of the uncomfortable male-female dynamic.

917
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,600
Practically the world's foremost expert on the subject.

918
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,360
Just for a fun point there,

919
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,500
they had just defeated Ramiel, Angel of Thunder,

920
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,600
that big crystal that hums a jaunty tune

921
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,240
as it drills

922
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,540
into

923
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,300
Tokyo 3.

924
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,040
The crystalline beings were also a prominent description of angels

925
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,920
in earlier apocryphal texts.

926
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,600
The stuff that got cut before we got to read it.

927
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,220
Interesting. Was that just stuff that ended up with the King James or just in general?

928
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:43,440
Well, there's two sets. There's the Apocrypha and then there's stuff that was never part of the Bible, like the Pseudo-Apocrypha.

929
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,300
And stuff that was cut out usually was just cut out because people's attitudes changed.

930
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,120
There was a big black plague a while ago and no one really wants to hear about heaven and angels after a big black plague.

931
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,100
So you don't have to read that anymore.

932
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,200
But you can't just use the lance of longevity...

933
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,840
You know, I almost think that would be more comforting, though.

934
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,600
Age of Reason was kind of dawning.

935
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,340
Ah,

936
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,820
so if you can't see it and smell it and taste it, it doesn't

937
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:04,940
exist.

938
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,480
It's our famous lance.

939
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,620
Ah.

940
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,660
There it goes.

941
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:10,900
And some

942
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,640
Longinus.

943
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,240
Whoosh.

944
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,300
You know where Longinus comes from.

945
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,320
Longinus was the Roman soldier who threw the spear that embedded himself in Christ's side when he was on the cross-face.

946
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,820
- Now,

947
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,880
we've

948
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,140
amped up the sound effects here on this

949
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,460
scene where she's holding the angel with one hand and shooting

950
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,300
it with the other, because the Japanese, bless their hearts, put this

951
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,500
really irritating boing, boing, boing noise in. And it's

952
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,460
such an intense part of the movie that it just

953
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,760
seems so inappropriate to me. So we tried

954
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,500
to bury that as much as humanly possible.

955
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:47,780
- But it's

956
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,740
still on the Japanese track

957
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,160
if you

958
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,360
prefer the original.

959
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,360
- Yep.

960
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,040
- I'm under 10%!

961
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,540
- Yeah, this is Armisail.

962
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,100
Angel of the womb is our little white

963
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,980
dragon

964
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,220
there.

965
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,040
Um,

966
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,900
which actually really resembles a lot of photographs of the original cherubs,

967
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,760
the cherebrum, which were always thought to be kind of wheel-shaped.

968
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:09,960
- Really?

969
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,180
- Yeah, angels had very odd...

970
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,940
They were chariot angels and they were, uh...

971
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,560
They were called, actually, uh, ophanim at the time.

972
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,800
Basically, they were wheels. They were big, fiery energy wheels.

973
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,260
Hot wheels of passion.

974
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,420
Literally, I found somebody who called them that in one of my older texts.

975
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,820
"Hot Ways of Passion."

976
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,120
That was the series they put out in the '70s.

977
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,260
"Hot Ways of Passion," yes.

978
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,780
Lowriders with fuzzy dice.

979
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,480
It usually played at the drive-in as a double feature with HOTS.

980
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,920
Which was cheerleader.

981
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,820
Now, the whole Evil Dead thing where the veins kind of pop out...

982
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,380
...is interesting here.

983
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,960
They just found ways to really

984
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,540
creepily...

985
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,840
Anything.

986
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,680
Yeah, this whole film is about finding ways to make the torture of these poor characters

987
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,480
just as unbearable as humanly possible.

988
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,100
Oh, yeah.

989
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,860
So that by the time the end of the world comes, we're ready for it.

990
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,300
Now, a lot of people have asked me when Rey has a little sort of conversation

991
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,680
within her mind with herself,

992
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,080
is it conscious versus subconscious,

993
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,200
ego versus super ego?

994
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,260
Personally,

995
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,060
I

996
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,760
think it's that the human aspect of Rey is confronting the angel aspect

997
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,320
of Rey.

998
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,900
When she's realizing what she's truly made

999
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,000
of.

1000
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,720
This

1001
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,600
is another scene that,

1002
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,300
if I'm not mistaken, is not

1003
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,600
in the

1004
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,520
American release.

1005
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,720
No, I think it's in the director's cut, though. I'm not totally sure on that.

1006
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,980
But we

1007
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,140
did a lot of research in doing the movie, and we had a hard time finding this scene.

1008
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,700
and we went, oh,

1009
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,580
it wasn't in the

1010
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,140
original.

1011
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,840
I think they just decided that Fiyutski couldn't

1012
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,260
end the series

1013
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,300
without having something

1014
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,320
a little

1015
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,700
shady about him, too.

1016
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,040
He was trying to get his best friend's girl.

1017
00:38:59,070 --> 00:38:59,180
Yeah.

1018
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,440
Only Pen Pen gets out unscathed.

1019
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,180
See, the thing is, I always

1020
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,720
felt

1021
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,060
that,

1022
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,880
I mean, ever since they did the episode

1023
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,820
where it sort of introduces Fiyutski,

1024
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,160
looking after Yui's research and whatnot.

1025
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,240
I always felt that he had a big crush on her,

1026
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,000
that he was in love with her.

1027
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,660
I

1028
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,740
also did the voice of Yui

1029
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,260
because, first of all,

1030
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,900
we couldn't get in touch with Kim Sevier,

1031
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,520
and second of all, because to me,

1032
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,420
it just seemed to make sense

1033
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,200
that if Rey is a clone of Yui,

1034
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,700
that whoever does Rey's voice

1035
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,000
should probably do Yui's voice.

1036
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,420
This is the scene where Spike

1037
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,279
dubbed Gendo Shadowbone

1038
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,420
because in a few moments you will see

1039
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,300
there is a big shadow cast

1040
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,360
and it looks like

1041
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,060
he has this

1042
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,020
ginormous

1043
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,580
bone.

1044
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,480
Wait, it's coming up.

1045
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:56,960
Coming

1046
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,300
up.

1047
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,880
There it is!

1048
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,580
Shadow bone, shadow bone.

1049
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,420
I swear, in between takes for like an hour,

1050
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,580
Spike would just start singing verses about shadow bone.

1051
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,620
This

1052
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,540
film drove me to shave my head, my God.

1053
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,380
You really are a cycle of Anna.

1054
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,800
I do my alms now.

1055
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,200
They are three wise men, three magic,

1056
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,780
named after the three wise men

1057
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,100
who very little has actually been written.

1058
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:24,680
There's

1059
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,840
not a ton out

1060
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,500
there that's really,

1061
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,920
I would say,

1062
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,480
credible.

1063
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,120
A lot of people will talk,

1064
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,100
but there's a lot of stories to tell about them,

1065
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,320
but really most of that stuff was made

1066
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,860
up in the last

1067
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,360
hundred years.

1068
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,200
It's cute.

1069
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:38,860
It's cute.

1070
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,980
It's just fun.

1071
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,040
This

1072
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,460
is Laura Chapman doing...

1073
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,260
Dr. Akagi.

1074
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,900
Dr. Akagi.

1075
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,580
She did a wonderful job.

1076
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,120
I love this scene.

1077
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,060
It is so evil.

1078
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,860
And it just makes me so happy.

1079
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,120
Children get strangled.

1080
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,400
It's wrong, evil, and bad.

1081
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,540
And it kind of made me giggle.

1082
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,640
I think it's because Ray is

1083
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,020
so evil to her.

1084
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,460
It's just...

1085
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,160
The whole thing is just wrong.

1086
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,700
It's wonderful.

1087
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,079
People that often haven't seen this movie laugh at this scene

1088
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,420
because it's just so weird to see this little child being so old,

1089
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,160
yeah, calling

1090
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,640
her old hag.

1091
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,340
One would almost think that this was

1092
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,640
set up.

1093
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,600
There's definitely

1094
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,440
a fate theme in this film,

1095
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,960
if for no other reason than Ode to Joy,

1096
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,980
and one would wonder if there was some plan in sending Rey in there that day,

1097
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,540
if this was the way to get rid of the doctor, the good doctor.

1098
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:29,920
And there's

1099
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,460
also an interesting blood

1100
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,920
sacrifice

1101
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
kind of metaphor

1102
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,339
going on

1103
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,980
that she bleeds all over the three computers,

1104
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,020
which is this new creature that she's created.

1105
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,900
- And imbued with her heart and soul.

1106
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:42,600
- It's that sacrifice,

1107
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,280
and we have tablas.

1108
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,440
A choice is made, and we have created something

1109
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,000
which will change the world.

1110
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:52,820
- Interesting.

1111
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,980
Oh, this is the one.

1112
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,460
- Oh no, go ahead.

1113
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,180
- We, uh.

1114
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,200
Okay, that noise for the angel

1115
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:11,860
It was actually a camel scream that we digitized and put grumpy flutter on it and pitched it

1116
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,860
and did all this crazy weird stuff, but it was so amazing to take this totally organic

1117
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,000
sound and turn it into this otherworldly terrifying thing.

1118
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,500
There was angel noise that neither Taliesin nor I could seem to

1119
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,040
get.

1120
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,060
Obviously in the future they use old power books, a lot of old equipment.

1121
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,020
You can actually buy them.

1122
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,760
They were selling the Nerve power book.

1123
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,880
Oh, okay. Awesome.

1124
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:37,500
And cell phones.

1125
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,300
Oh, there's a tie-in for everything.

1126
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,800
Zuriel, this poor angel who's about to get what's coming to him,

1127
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,180
is mostly associated with the moon.

1128
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,440
He's got some other interesting associations.

1129
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,540
That's my favorite, though, because from this point on in the show,

1130
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,120
the moon figures in pretty heavily.

1131
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,280
We will get to that a little later, though.

1132
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,960
Now, I did the Ava growls and

1133
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,940
soon-to-be munching

1134
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,800
noises here.

1135
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,980
It was kind of one of the creepier things to do, but it's just so feral.

1136
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,560
It's like this weird

1137
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,080
insectozoid

1138
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,780
rabid dog type.

1139
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
Yeah, that was such a weird...

1140
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,480
It's such a creepy scene, I think,

1141
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,600
in

1142
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:24,860
general.

1143
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,480
It's the eyes in the human hand that really always got to me.

1144
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,100
There's

1145
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:35,180
something that really is disturbing down to the very core of a human being, watching this.

1146
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:41,120
And just the motions here. This is like, "Oh, you've caught the dog and he's eating something he shouldn't be eating."

1147
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,200
And then he's like, "All right, fine. I'm proud of it."

1148
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,880
This is Keith Burgess took over the role of Hugo for the movie.

1149
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,960
Free of what?

1150
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,040
Best line!

1151
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,280
Best

1152
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,900
line. Free of what?

1153
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,880
We love that one.

1154
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,680
Brian Granvelt was unavailable for the project, so we had...

1155
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,860
Keith Burgess took over that role.

1156
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,280
Unit 1 has

1157
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,600
been awakened and set free.

1158
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,920
Sele sure won't stay quiet for this.

1159
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,960
Is this part of your scenario, Commander Ikari?

1160
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,320
Sele

1161
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,420
is, as our official word goes, is German for sold.

1162
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:21,620
There was a couple other interpretations running around for a while, but...

1163
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,020
I dug up the...

1164
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,540
Gehern.

1165
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,060
Gehern.

1166
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,720
Gehern for the mind, yeah.

1167
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,980
Good for the mind and the soul.

1168
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,960
Ray in the hospital once again.

1169
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,700
First cranial nerve.

1170
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,080
All of this underground Tokyo complex

1171
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,600
is very much designed to function and work like a human brain.

1172
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,020
Everything is named after functions and parts of the human brain

1173
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:42,380
and

1174
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:42,660
things that...

1175
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,500
Anyway, thank you for saving me.

1176
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:43,820
It's all

1177
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,380
very intellectual in design.

1178
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,560
You saved me.

1179
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,200
I really don't have the brain to go into every little bit and detail of it,

1180
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,220
But if you're willing to sit down with a Grey's Anatomy and map out the Tokyo 3 complex,

1181
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,380
you can figure out where people are and where they're heading.

1182
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,660
It's very unusual.

1183
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,940
Why do they always do those bubbles?

1184
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,720
It looks like somebody tooted in the tank.

1185
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,420
All right, it's just me.

1186
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:08,760
Sorry.

1187
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,780
The race stew scene.

1188
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,600
Race stew.

1189
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Yeah, we're into the disturbing imagery.

1190
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,100
Yeah, once again, this one kind of creeped

1191
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,340
me out.

1192
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,380
Do you notice that these rays actually have

1193
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,540
nipples?

1194
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,620
Nipples and smiles.

1195
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:29,480
Nipples and smiles.

1196
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,340
Two things you don't see very often.

1197
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:31,480
You know what?

1198
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,180
I'm going to make a band

1199
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,080
called Nipples and Smiles.

1200
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,160
70s cover band.

1201
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:37,760
Yes.

1202
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,960
They have

1203
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,900
a name for that room.

1204
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,020
Chamber

1205
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,440
of Goth.

1206
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,720
Chamber of Goth, thank you.

1207
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,920
I looked and I looked, and I cannot find any other reference

1208
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,520
other than the one

1209
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,060
we found

1210
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,540
for it,

1211
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,120
which I can't remember at the moment.

1212
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,260
It was

1213
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,980
the

1214
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,620
article written by some religious

1215
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,220
professor

1216
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,080
referring to it.

1217
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,500
It's from the book of Enoch,

1218
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:04,020
right?

1219
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,660
It is an Enoch, so I'm told,

1220
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,700
but I haven't been able to find it

1221
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,080
in any of the three books of Enoch yet.

1222
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,600
It must be somewhere.

1223
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,720
We do know it is the room of unborn souls,

1224
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,980
of souls that have yet to have had lives.

1225
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,420
Which actually is ironic,

1226
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,320
Because these are bodies that are yet to have souls.

1227
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,740
So it's like the anti-chamber of guff.

1228
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:22,960
Yes, I do.

1229
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,340
I'm destroying the--

1230
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,500
Now it's the lake in MacArthur Park.

1231
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,920
It's all the play pieces.

1232
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,320
Yeah, only one soul for all those bodies.

1233
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:33,920
You're

1234
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,280
late!

1235
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,660
Sorry, sorry.

1236
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,460
Which again, Aaron Crone is Kaworu.

1237
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,120
Who knew that the bringer of impending dune played the violin?

1238
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:43,660
That's--

1239
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,160
I always thought violin players were kind of evil.

1240
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:54,420
strange hands. So once again why do they, what's this concerto whole little,

1241
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,460
this

1242
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,140
arrangement

1243
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,200
thing they're doing here?

1244
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,320
The alternate universe of what life could have been. No,

1245
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:03,820
well, no,

1246
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,460
wait, this little thing?

1247
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,660
This is actually, this is in continuity, I found out. This did

1248
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:17,320
happen. This is just a day at school, about, I guess it's maybe a week before everything

1249
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,000
goes down.

1250
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:18,740
Oh really?

1251
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,920
Yes. They were all apparently got together and did this musical number.

1252
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,660
It's just a framework obviously. They really...

1253
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,520
Where did you hear that?

1254
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,700
I'm trying to remember.

1255
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:39,320
It was in one of... something I picked up in Japan if I recall. I have... everything comes from so

1256
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,360
many different sources on this film. You have to just because whether or not it was meant to be

1257
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:51,000
there you can you can just analyze this movie from any aspect and find interesting parallels it is it

1258
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,840
is base myth and in base myth you can find all sorts of different

1259
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,880
angles let's go brad

1260
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,260
weaver's

1261
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,300
toji the reluctant

1262
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,060
ava pilot our

1263
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,780
black ava

1264
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,320
this

1265
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,440
Yeah, so a 13th angel.

1266
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,180
Bardial.

1267
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,360
Angel of Hail.

1268
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,440
Never quite dealt with that one.

1269
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,960
One of the two angels.

1270
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,680
They had two Avas over in Nevada.

1271
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,960
The silver one and the black one.

1272
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,160
The silver one got blown up,

1273
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,480
and the black one got infected with this angel.

1274
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,360
Or is this angel?

1275
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,160
There is a story in some biblical texts

1276
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,340
of certain angels being the carriers of the souls of the dead

1277
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,460
look like demons so that they can pass into hell untouched that is that is not from enoch as far

1278
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:56,520
as i know i believe it's from milton not milton uh dante one of the two you read them both

1279
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,340
so it would make sense that there was kind of the stealthy

1280
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,000
the stealth angel don't

1281
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,460
mind me just

1282
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,220
He's carrying a soul?

1283
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:05,740
I can't!

1284
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,880
If he's still alive, we've got to try and help him!

1285
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,840
I just can't kill another human being!

1286
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,200
It's him or you!

1287
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,060
No!

1288
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:13,840
No!

1289
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,620
Love the way he does

1290
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:15,820
this.

1291
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:15,860
A

1292
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,060
little indents on the neck.

1293
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,180
It's really well

1294
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,480
done.

1295
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,140
Looks painful.

1296
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:21,440
Correct.

1297
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,240
Switch all control to the dummy plug system.

1298
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,920
But sir, the dummy plug isn't fully operational yet.

1299
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,040
Dr. Hakagi hasn't approved its use.

1300
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,040
It's still

1301
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,500
better than the current pilot!

1302
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,840
So the dummy plugs were in theory actually piloted by some of the spare rays.

1303
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:44,500
And I thought they were talking about the next set of production evas were maybe even spare kawarus.

1304
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,920
They were.

1305
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,340
Yes.

1306
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:45,660
They

1307
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,360
were spare kawarus. Actually there's like...

1308
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:47,900
Never quite.

1309
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:48,600
...a

1310
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:57,620
frame, maybe two frames in Rebirth where you see the plugs being screwed into the EVA series.

1311
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:58,760
A little blip.

1312
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,100
And

1313
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,540
if you pause it, it says "Kuaru" along the side.

1314
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,240
Aren't you glad you bought the DVD now?

1315
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,340
Yeah. Frame

1316
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,820
by frame.

1317
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,060
Get to go through it.

1318
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,500
We'll give you some

1319
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,940
more goodies in the end of "Evangelii."

1320
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,700
There's some

1321
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,620
really great

1322
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,180
freeze frames in

1323
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,280
there.

1324
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:17,520
Freeze

1325
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,080
frames, yeah.

1326
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,460
A friend of mine who loves the psychological aspect of the show

1327
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,300
once postulated that

1328
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,900
Shinji

1329
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,380
is actually

1330
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,880
feeling the

1331
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,940
rage too since it is

1332
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,760
a synchronization

1333
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,660
she said it was the robot that saved

1334
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,020
our lives

1335
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:37,560
eva and the pilot that that's part of the torture of this this particular scene

1336
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,780
oh interesting

1337
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,720
feel that one for a little while

1338
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,320
oh man yeah

1339
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,040
he's not just witness to this that he's part of it

1340
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,380
wow this movie makes my head hurt

1341
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,620
Chris Spike

1342
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,120
Spencer once

1343
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:56,680
again did

1344
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,600
an amazing, amazing job.

1345
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,520
Stop!

1346
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,740
Father, no!

1347
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,840
One of those scenes. Oh, and cut to the girlfriend.

1348
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,880
That's just brutal.

1349
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,860
This is Kimberly Yates. She kind of did a lot of the different voices.

1350
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,180
She just, she, we love working with Kimberly because she just cracks us up.

1351
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,280
What shall I cook is one of my favorite lines of this whole deal.

1352
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,040
So cute.

1353
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,540
Is she

1354
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,340
from the TV series

1355
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,320
or is she, uh...

1356
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,280
I'm sorry?

1357
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
Is she from the original series?

1358
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:25,780
No,

1359
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,240
originally it

1360
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,620
was Carol Amerson was Hikari,

1361
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,060
but again, another actor fell off the face of the earth.

1362
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,680
She was a radio DJ in Houston and don't

1363
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,200
know where she went.

1364
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,260
It seems like you're

1365
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:38,420
always

1366
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:38,680
the

1367
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,500
life of the radio DJ.

1368
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,380
Commander Ryutski is the one who's

1369
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,800
probably working in Albuquerque right now.

1370
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,400
Have you been asking around about your father?

1371
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,980
I just haven't been around him much.

1372
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,240
And Ray's glasses,

1373
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,140
her symbol of the one nice act that she's had,

1374
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,860
I imagine,

1375
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,620
in her very

1376
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,940
short life.

1377
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,280
The young tough Kendo.

1378
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,280
It's Kaji, right?

1379
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,320
That's why

1380
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,160
we spend so much time...

1381
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
Yeah, Kaji's speaking to Shinji.

1382
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,700
He's kind of...

1383
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,920
Kaji is kind of...

1384
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,160
Shinji's...

1385
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,800
What

1386
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,260
Shinji would love his alter ego to be,

1387
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,060
this cool, smooth, you know...

1388
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,300
just

1389
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,640
pimp daddy kind of, you know.

1390
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,800
He's also one of the most

1391
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,040
really

1392
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,360
understandable characters.

1393
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:33,600
He

1394
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,760
speaks and it sounds like

1395
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,480
it makes sense.

1396
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,000
I don't mean to interrupt. This is my favorite scene.

1397
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,120
This is Allison playing

1398
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,500
Masato and she's had a few drinks

1399
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,260
and I just love her

1400
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,800
right here.

1401
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,080
Should I buy you some fire?

1402
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,200
I just love

1403
00:52:53,180 --> 00:53:01,240
And actually, when they switch here to this two shot, she talks about homeostasis.

1404
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,380
And I'm just so sad we had to bury it because there was this other new conversation going on.

1405
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,560
But we laughed a lot in the studio on that.

1406
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,040
Allison did an amazing job.

1407
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,760
I don't think anyone could ever have done the role of Misato Justice the way Allison did.

1408
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,180
Actually, when Mac Greenfield and I were originally casting the series,

1409
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,940
I wanted to read for Masato,

1410
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,880
because I thought she was just a great, really cool character.

1411
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,620
And then Alison came in and read for her,

1412
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,700
and I just heard Alison read, and I went,

1413
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,120
OK, never mind.

1414
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,160
She was so dead-on perfect

1415
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,080
that we couldn't not cast her.

1416
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,720
There's nothing like hearing somebody do your part so much better.

1417
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,180
It's like, damn it.

1418
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:46,380
OK.

1419
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,540
Well, there goes that part.

1420
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,140
I always joke that Mac cast me as Ray

1421
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,660
because he wanted to keep me quiet for a while.

1422
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:54,540
He was tired of listening to me do all these spazzy young characters.

1423
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,160
Wait, here he comes.

1424
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:56,920
Here he comes.

1425
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,680
Are we going to talk about this?

1426
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:00,640
In a minute.

1427
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,080
Okay.

1428
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,600
Hi.

1429
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
You're a little late, aren't you?

1430
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,280
Oh, my God!

1431
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,800
They killed Kaji!

1432
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,600
You bastards!

1433
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,020
Why won't

1434
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,620
you listen to me?

1435
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,800
Kaji is dead!

1436
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,580
I've been waiting to do that for a year, dude.

1437
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,080
Well, on the original Japanese soundtrack,

1438
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:23,200
That sound was a much less pronounced shot.

1439
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,020
It sounded like someone got slapped.

1440
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:31,240
And we weren't happy with that, so we put in a great gunshot, or Sean, our sound engineer.

1441
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,020
Sound god.

1442
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,000
Put in a great shot there.

1443
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,240
That is one of the big questions of Ava.

1444
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,540
Who shot Kaji?

1445
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:47,800
I mean, we get asked that a lot at conventions, and I think it's yet another give them something to talk about in the parking lot moment where, you know, it's...

1446
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:49,300
They're not gonna tell us.

1447
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,100
It's Japanese film. You don't get answers. You get questions.

1448
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,660
Exactly. You're gonna have to live with that.

1449
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:53,900
My

1450
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,920
favorite, though, is when some fans come up to me and say,

1451
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,200
"What was it?" Oh, they were talking about a part in, uh...

1452
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,440
in, uh, the Eva movie where there's one part where Gendo's lips move.

1453
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,140
Right, right. And no sound comes out.

1454
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:07,780
And he's like,

1455
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,500
"Well, uh, I have a friend who read the lip flaps,

1456
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,340
and he says that it said blah, blah, blah."

1457
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,800
And Jason's... Jason goes, "Um, it's a cartoon!"

1458
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,420
It's

1459
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,640
lip flaps. That's all they do.

1460
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:23,400
This scene is actually probably just one of the sweetest scenes in all of cinema, I think.

1461
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,240
Just this little exchange between the two.

1462
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,640
And it's so cute when Shinji gets embarrassed when he calls him Mr. Ikari.

1463
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,100
It's just

1464
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,880
a

1465
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,820
little blush and everything.

1466
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:38,600
And I think both Spike and Aaron did an incredible job of capturing that.

1467
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,560
This whole... I mean, there is some homoeroticism under this scene,

1468
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,900
but that's not really what this scene is about.

1469
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:45,380
So

1470
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,260
it's just so precious, I think.

1471
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,340
Yeah, it's people bonding.

1472
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,320
It's a friendship, and a real friendship.

1473
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,740
I've always thought that...

1474
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,840
It's funny, because the character of Quarro is so brilliant and so cruel.

1475
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:09,060
Because this is the only character that has ever said to Shinji that he's loved.

1476
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,160
Quarro tells Shinji that he loves him, and then Shinji is forced to kill him.

1477
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,640
That's just way, way too depressing.

1478
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,460
It's the essence of sacrifice.

1479
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,220
The essence of honor.

1480
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,940
It's the essence of honor. I could bottle it.

1481
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,660
I hate you.

1482
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,920
Don't talk to me ever again.

1483
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,760
Guaranteed to clear a room.

1484
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,740
I saw this episode with a room full of Kabbalists.

1485
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,220
It

1486
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,560
was funny. The minute we heard Oda Joy being hummed,

1487
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,200
we realized she was doomed.

1488
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,040
So

1489
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,460
there's a room full of occultists going, oh no.

1490
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,320
Well, which symbolism does Odejoy have?

1491
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,520
Odejoy, according to some people, and I'll back this up,

1492
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,480
he's quite possibly one of the great human achievements.

1493
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,440
Oh, absolutely.

1494
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,320
It almost justifies our worth on this planet that this

1495
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,720
exists.

1496
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,280
As Kororo says earlier.

1497
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,900
One of the greatest human achievements.

1498
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,060
And it's about destiny.

1499
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:17,760
It was really, as the author himself will admit, it's about destiny and beyond religious destiny, spiritual destiny.

1500
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:23,540
And Kawada being this angel of free will.

1501
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,600
And in my opinion, there's also a bit of Gabriel in here.

1502
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,960
We have music and we have

1503
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,360
that

1504
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,320
musical grand finale which Gabriel

1505
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,280
has always

1506
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,920
promised that he's going to bring us at the end.

1507
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,420
And one of the most human of the angels.

1508
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:36,860
I

1509
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,940
won't believe that Karu's an angel. It's a lie!

1510
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,620
It's this moment of decision.

1511
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,200
It's this decision of who is going to...

1512
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,460
Is the sacrifice going to be made or are we not going to be capable of it?

1513
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:49,160
Of

1514
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:49,700
the individual

1515
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,920
and how the individual shapes the world around them.

1516
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,220
That line, Shinji, you're late, is just such a multifaceted line.

1517
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,280
To me, I always kind of get teary listening to it.

1518
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,720
He's late to

1519
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:03,860
so

1520
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,620
many things.

1521
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,340
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1522
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,920
And then we get into our AT Fields.

1523
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,360
The angel wore tennis shoes.

1524
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:14,840
It's just such

1525
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,640
a funny--

1526
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,140
No, no, no.

1527
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,960
And once again--

1528
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,140
The converse

1529
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,420
of our

1530
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,980
destruction.

1531
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:20,680
The converse

1532
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,400
is fabulous.

1533
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,280
We're so going to get hate mail.

1534
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,300
Once

1535
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,940
again, Aaron Crone just did an amazing job with this.

1536
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,140
Just absolutely beautiful.

1537
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:30,540
Got

1538
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:30,660
him!

1539
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:31,300
Stop!

1540
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,020
I'd better call it on than I would have ever imagined.

1541
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,900
And Spike does a wonderful

1542
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,180
job at portraying just how

1543
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,980
tortured Chinchius

1544
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,940
in this sequence.

1545
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,680
This sort of wrestling between trying

1546
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,340
to save the world

1547
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:51,920
and not wanting to kill his best friend and only love.

1548
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,820
Something interesting I came across

1549
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,820
a

1550
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,600
couple nights ago,

1551
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,140
I was reading

1552
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,420
through

1553
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,080
Mr.

1554
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,560
Crowley's book of Thoth,

1555
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,880
and he was talking about the Cain and Abel method

1556
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,880
from an appalled standpoint.

1557
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,440
and how the murder of the brother

1558
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,660
and how it represents to

1559
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,140
another

1560
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,460
symbol

1561
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,960
of the tarot card of the lovers

1562
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,420
and

1563
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,820
how it's really about this act of Cain,

1564
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:21,200
who really

1565
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,420
did love his brother.

1566
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,480
There was a real love.

1567
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,520
The sacrifice of that which gave you love

1568
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,720
and that which you loved most was actually the first...

1569
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,580
It was the first time biblically

1570
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:31,680
that God really paid attention to what we were doing

1571
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,200
and the first time that he personally...

1572
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,340
- It's a mankind's faith.

1573
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,960
- Got in there and got involved

1574
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,800
And this is certainly the same act.

1575
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,540
And this is certainly about to get God's attention.

1576
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,300
Oh, yeah.

1577
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,360
Something interesting.

1578
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,300
That

1579
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,060
is interesting.

1580
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,640
Aoba, this was my character.

1581
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:52,440
He

1582
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,140
didn't do much in...

1583
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,420
He actually had more of a

1584
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,380
role

1585
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:59,520
in the movies than he did the original series.

1586
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:05,120
He was just kind of the button pusher more and the announcer of horrible

1587
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,520
things.

1588
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,060
Impending doom.

1589
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:06,520
Yeah.

1590
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,500
I really

1591
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,240
always loved our little Greek chorus.

1592
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,100
The three, yeah.

1593
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,880
Gendo's Peeps.

1594
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,500
Gendo's

1595
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:15,880
Peeps.

1596
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,480
It's Posse.

1597
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,120
This music is so beautiful.

1598
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,980
They've got such an incredible rendition as well.

1599
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,360
I've never been able to find a copy of this piece of music

1600
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:29,800
that I've loved

1601
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,360
more than this copy.

1602
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,440
Again, a soundtrack worth picking up.

1603
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,120
Here you see

1604
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,100
between

1605
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:37,680
the...

1606
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,640
I love this music.

1607
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,960
This is Hugo and Masato's, their whole tension.

1608
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Unrequited love thing.

1609
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,040
There's

1610
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,700
all this small little inter-office vibes going on there.

1611
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,860
Except for Aoba and his guitar.

1612
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,860
Aoba gets nothing in this.

1613
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,520
He's the only guy

1614
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,400
who gets no action at all in the whole series.

1615
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,360
Even Ray at the end doesn't do anything for him.

1616
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,460
I mean, it's just amazing.

1617
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,700
Literally, he's the...

1618
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,040
And he's the rock star.

1619
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,920
I mean, for crying out loud,

1620
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,260
he should be

1621
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,020
getting more than anybody.

1622
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:14,800
Lilith.

1623
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,500
I see. I understand now.

1624
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,600
Lilith. Lilith.

1625
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:19,960
Lilith.

1626
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,900
I like how there's all this insane action going on in the background.

1627
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,660
He's just sort of standing

1628
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:24,760
there,

1629
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,960
floating there with his hands in his

1630
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,300
pants.

1631
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,440
Oh, that's what it's all about.

1632
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,140
You know, if I could float, I wouldn't be that

1633
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:30,920
interested either.

1634
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:31,900
Just

1635
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,660
saying so.

1636
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,500
And we

1637
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,220
have our sacrifice.

1638
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:36,900
Blood has been

1639
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,220
spilled.

1640
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:37,660
We are

1641
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,360
standing knee

1642
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,860
-deep in Lula's blood to begin with.

1643
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,140
No menstruation analogy there.

1644
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:43,880
No.

1645
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,920
It's there. It's part of it.

1646
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,300
She was cut in half.

1647
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,400
Right down there.

1648
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,920
I mean, she had the longulis lance in her.

1649
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,020
They removed it,

1650
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,640
and half of her grew

1651
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:53,900
back.

1652
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:54,220
I

1653
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,440
mean, there's a lot to be said there.

1654
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,420
And you can see the little rays they've been pulling off of

1655
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,320
her

1656
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:58,640
wound.

1657
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,720
They've been making little

1658
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,700
girls out of her wound.

1659
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,720
talking about please don't make me do this

1660
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,520
another connection worth

1661
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,980
playing with that mask

1662
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,300
by the way

1663
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:12,980
the seven eyes of god is is very worthwhile um i actually wrote this down so i'm so impressed

1664
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,320
with the finding you are not the existence which should die several

1665
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,340
times in in

1666
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:17,920
the bible it's

1667
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,520
mentioned that

1668
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,580
it is what you god has seven eyes and and so we have this

1669
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,260
again is also god's number

1670
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:24,840
- Seven as

1671
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,720
well. - Seven as well.

1672
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,000
One eye on unit zero, two eyes on unit one,

1673
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,120
four eyes on unit two.

1674
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,100
- On unit two, yeah.

1675
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:32,620
- Yeah, it's

1676
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,180
seven eyes.

1677
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,840
- Oh, wow. - Celia's a logo as well.

1678
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,720
Just another thing worth taking a look at and worth looking at later.

1679
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,820
Now, didn't he say... No.

1680
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,420
Which Babylonian god was unit one modeled after?

1681
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,240
God, I...

1682
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,240
There's been a bit of debate about this.

1683
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:06,300
I've heard some odd human being that I talked to at a convention said Ishtar.

1684
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,060
I've never really gone with that one.

1685
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:17,320
God, I wanted to say Unicron, but there's a single-horned demon in the Babylonian pantheon

1686
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,840
that, again, has been turned into a demon for the Christian mythos

1687
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,420
and is involved very much in that same Cain and Abel movement

1688
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,200
and that same sacrificial movement.

1689
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,740
Again, it's the same theme repeated over and over again,

1690
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,920
sacrifice and movement, sacrifice and movement.

1691
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,220
I find it interesting in this scene that we didn't see Shinji go to the cockpit

1692
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,380
and tormenting with the whole decision.

1693
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,460
It just showed the...

1694
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,480
It almost makes it more excruciating that they don't show it.

1695
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,080
That one's like the elevator scene, yet it's way more poignant with the music and whatnot.

1696
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,720
Now, is this log formation an angel?

1697
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,620
It certainly looks like one of the later units, doesn't

1698
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:00,640
it?

1699
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:01,240
It does, and

1700
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,360
it's obviously a tree, but I've always thought it looked like an angel,

1701
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:11,260
especially maybe when, reminiscent of the part where...

1702
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,440
One of the Eviseries.

1703
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:12,860
When

1704
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:19,820
every series was eating the angel, taking it in, that whole, you know, kind of that bent-over, haunched type thing.

1705
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:20,880
Want

1706
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,620
some freestyle occultism here?

1707
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,160
Go for it.

1708
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:29,560
Okay, well, right now we're talking about a major religion that's been in the news a lot recently.

1709
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,900
There's definitely something to be said about someone kneeling towards a sunset, isn't there?

1710
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:36,960
Oh, okay.

1711
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,540
I see.

1712
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,120
I just picked that up just now.

1713
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,660
Again, every time you watch this film, something new comes in.

1714
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:45,580
Something that doesn't matter if it was intended to be there, it's there.

1715
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:49,440
And you have to, much like an amazing painting, you have to kind of take it in.

1716
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,760
And this is probably one of the most beautiful credit sequences I've ever seen.

1717
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,680
The sun is setting.

1718
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:54,300
Yeah.

1719
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,040
They animated it.

1720
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,120
The sun is actually moving.

1721
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,700
If you fast forward it, it slowly just kind of...

1722
01:04:59,059 --> 01:04:59,380
Sinks.

1723
01:04:59,780 --> 01:04:59,920
Sinks.

1724
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:07,440
And something I noticed watching this with the air back-to-back

1725
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,400
is the opening scene of Air is the reverse shot of this.

1726
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,320
Really?

1727
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,320
Yes, it is. We'll see that in the next commentary.

1728
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,160
I will point it out.

1729
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,000
It's this shot reversed with the log,

1730
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,300
and he's looking, it's bright,

1731
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,220
and he's looking for, like, say he was past that pole.

1732
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,960
He's on the other side of that pole,

1733
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,680
and obviously he's not in this lake, but that's the shot.

1734
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,200
And I noticed that.

1735
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,840
And once again, it's something you don't notice.

1736
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,360
It's the first time

1737
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,460
it's ever in the crew to make.

1738
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:36,620
You'll

1739
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,040
pick it up.

1740
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,880
Unless I'm completely wrong.

1741
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,540
We'll take a look and find out.

1742
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,480
Either way, it's very interesting.

1743
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:49,600
I do know that we do start on a side of the lake,

1744
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:50,640
and right now we're in the lake.

1745
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,360
So we will take a look at that when we get back from this.

1746
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,400
Oh, and now we're on a second volley of credits.

1747
01:05:58,019 --> 01:05:59,840
This is the never-ending credit sequence.

1748
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:04,160
But, you know, that's wonderful that they made it so beautiful.

1749
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,440
I almost feel guilty talking over it because it's

1750
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,080
so...

1751
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,780
They can turn us off at any time.

1752
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:09,240
That is true.

1753
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,460
It's just so gorgeous.

1754
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,180
They can zoom,

1755
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,220
they can rewind it again.

1756
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,780
It is an amazing, amazing piece of music.

1757
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:21,580
Again, this piece of music is the theme throughout all of this part of the show,

1758
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,620
of this film, the canon.

1759
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,340
I suppose we should...

1760
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,280
Well, yeah, I guess we're about at the end,

1761
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,380
so thank you very much for listening to the commentary.

1762
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,140
I hope we gave you some insight into the production

1763
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,840
and obviously Taliesin gave us a lot of background

1764
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,080
in mythology and all the kind of symbolism.

1765
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,420
- That was just loud.

1766
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,660
- Well, you know.

1767
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,360
- So we hope that you will join us

1768
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,440
for our commentary on Rebirth

1769
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,720
and on Air and Sincerely Yours.

1770
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,500
- More occult and voice acting fun.

1771
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,560
- More to come.

1772
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,200
- More to come.

1773
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,560
¶¶

1774
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,580
¶¶

1775
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,400
The End

1776
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,140
I

1777
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:42,860
talked about at the end of Eva where it's basically the reverse shot of the final credits that we see.

1778
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,140
At the end of death. You're right.

1779
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:44,820
Wow.

1780
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:45,900
You're the smartest.

1781
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,260
And it's

1782
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,480
into the blue. We've gone from an orange shot over there to the blue over here.

1783
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,620
Right. And I just discovered that just yesterday, as a matter of fact.

1784
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,360
So you still discover things in this movie that you did not notice.

1785
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:01,120
This movie is so multi-layered and multifaceted. It's amazing.

1786
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:09,560
Now, Spike Spencer, who played Shinji, of course, when I first told him about this

1787
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,180
opening sequence,

1788
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,140
Spike's response was to start laughing and turn to me and go, of course.

1789
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,540
Of course that's what Shinji does.

1790
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:22,900
So,

1791
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,920
at least it wasn't

1792
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,600
a shock to him.

1793
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,320
I think we can all comment on our first time seeing this scene, that is.

1794
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:29,980
We're

1795
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,680
fooling around.

1796
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,340
Yes, thank you. I was actually with a group of friends watching this for the first time.

1797
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:39,420
About five guys, four girls, were all sitting in the back of a bank room. It's an anime club.

1798
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,160
All the guys at once, there was just this moment where we all realized what was going on and just all lost it.

1799
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,340
And not a girl in there caught on.

1800
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,000
Until he had the handful of baby batter?

1801
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,080
No, they even didn't get it then.

1802
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:52,660
No.

1803
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,860
I had no idea.

1804
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,760
It was some of the densest women ever.

1805
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,140
This is a bad moment.

1806
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,260
Handful of baby batter.

1807
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,520
That's just good cinema.

1808
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:12,780
And actually the line he delivers when he, after the thing, is very controversial.

1809
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:19,260
We went away with it that we believe is very true to the original.

1810
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,980
And there's, of course, this is one of these things.

1811
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,400
Many different people say it's a different, many different interpretations from the Japanese.

1812
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,960
Yes, there was one fan who actually told us that we were using gratuitous swearing.

1813
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:36,560
And I disagreed strongly.

1814
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:45,880
I think that in this particular situation, the fact that a 14-year-old boy is wanking over the comatose body of a 14-year-old girl...

1815
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:47,600
Money shot.

1816
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,280
I think

1817
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,100
to have him say, I'm so fucked up.

1818
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:53,900
Yeah, exactly.

1819
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:54,620
That's pretty

1820
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,160
much right there.

1821
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,420
Now, at the conventions, though, we have actually been screening this at conventions.

1822
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,380
By the time you see this, you'll probably have seen it

1823
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:03,500
at

1824
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:03,900
a convention.

1825
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,680
But that line always gets a huge amount of applause.

1826
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:09,360
Yeah.

1827
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:09,680
It's

1828
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:09,980
amazing.

1829
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,520
So that one fan who didn't like it, don't watch.

1830
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,240
Not our problem.

1831
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,040
And here's where Aoba gets fleshed out as a little more of a

1832
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,020
grumpy character.

1833
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,880
It's just a bad coffee day, I think.

1834
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,200
End of the world would be a bad coffee day.

1835
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:24,680
This whole end of

1836
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,700
the world day, he's grumpy this whole day pretty much.

1837
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,500
This whole episode, these two episodes,

1838
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,060
he's just,

1839
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,680
he's like, you know, you people are idiots basically.

1840
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,540
Here's once again Allison Keith, amazing, amazing actress.

1841
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:43,340
She's always just done an incredible job with Misato.

1842
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:50,760
And, oh, I meant to send her, there's some fan forums and some web boards saying, you know,

1843
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,100
oh, the only reason I watched Evangelion

1844
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,300
is because I wanted to see

1845
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,000
Alice and Keith do Misato again.

1846
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,080
So, I don't think she ever knew that.

1847
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,500
She needs to know that.

1848
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,000
She's awesome.

1849
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,220
She'll never listen to the commentary anyway.

1850
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:06,760
That's okay.

1851
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,040
She couldn't

1852
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,460
be bothered.

1853
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,860
Here we have Salee a little more fleshed out.

1854
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,260
It's Salee the Space Odyssey at this point.

1855
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:13,660
Yeah, exactly.

1856
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:14,220
The

1857
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:14,740
obelisks.

1858
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,020
Okay, does anybody else think

1859
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,400
that Fuski looks like Jay Leno

1860
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,620
with the ginormous chin?

1861
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,000
Yes, the Kawamori...

1862
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,420
There's you. That was you.

1863
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,520
We need not cast aside our human form.

1864
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,940
I admit I'm running the Illuminati.

1865
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:29,340
I'll

1866
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,340
admit

1867
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,100
it to it right now.

1868
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,180
It's interesting they put sound only on the obelisk like that.

1869
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,100
Like, we don't see the disembodied, you know what I mean?

1870
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,120
Well, yeah, originally in the show,

1871
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,500
there's the holographic projections of all of them.

1872
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,440
That's why they're all different colors.

1873
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,520
So they're having technical

1874
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,740
difficulties at this point.

1875
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,560
I think they just can't be bothered at this point.

1876
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,460
They're not shaving.

1877
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,600
They're saving money for the big end of the world sequence.

1878
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,480
Which the people who run this,

1879
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,600
what they're going to be doing up to the very last moment

1880
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,220
is just making sure they've got down those 20 bucks.

1881
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,140
Making sure they have Cab Fair home.

1882
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:06,440
They

1883
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,960
learned their lesson from the first one,

1884
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,580
so that was a

1885
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,660
series.

1886
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,360
I can drag that into an interesting occult place, actually.

1887
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,100
There's a big thing in this film

1888
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,880
about the fruit of life and the fruit of wisdom,

1889
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,380
which, as we all know, we ate the fruits of wisdom in the garden.

1890
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,780
Very significant. Go on.

1891
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:23,300
Yes.

1892
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,040
And we're banished before we could eat the fruit of life.

1893
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,780
A lot of the times fruit of wisdom is considered to be a material,

1894
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,360
intellectual look at the world, whereas the fruit of life,

1895
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,540
not just being eternal life, but is a spiritual connection with God.

1896
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,500
It's a little bit too much intellectualism and things start to go.

1897
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:42,500
And

1898
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,200
explain the

1899
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,340
very significant comment you

1900
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:44,940
just made about the

1901
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,340
glasses.

1902
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:51,460
This is when you first realize that Rey has turned against

1903
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:51,660
Gendo.

1904
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,700
She's thinking on her own.

1905
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:58,260
And then not only that, the scene that came afterwards was Shinji curled up with his recorder and

1906
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,760
the battery was dead.

1907
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,520
The first time I saw that, it gave me chills.

1908
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,400
I couldn't explain why.

1909
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,300
It wasn't that incredibly significant.

1910
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:13,000
But for some reason, I just thought that that was a smart choice.

1911
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,680
Masato's moved on to canned coffee now instead of beer.

1912
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,540
That would panic anybody.

1913
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,360
That should panic

1914
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:20,680
anyone.

1915
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,560
Actually, we saw that one.

1916
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:28,160
There was a poster that had all the female cast of Eva

1917
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,740
holding that canned coffee.

1918
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:33,080
Yeah, the UCC coffee that everybody drinks.

1919
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,080
Official coffee

1920
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:35,700
of the apocalypse.

1921
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,400
You're a post-apocalyptic caffeine source.

1922
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:43,400
See, look, Leno.

1923
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,020
Totally Leno

1924
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:45,300
Yeah,

1925
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,880
character designs got a little funny for

1926
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,060
this film

1927
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,260
He looks a little bit like the guy from Battle Angel

1928
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,420
Oh, uh, you know

1929
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,160
There's

1930
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,260
not much you can say at this point

1931
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,280
This is an

1932
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,280
amazing techno babble that they managed to run through this entire sequence

1933
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,860
Which was a big pain in the neck to translate

1934
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,040
It's always the worst

1935
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:07,040
And I remember I was writing that part of the script

1936
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,540
And I'd come upstairs and I'd say to Jason

1937
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,860
You should be writing this part, it's all boy stuff

1938
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,100
I don't know any

1939
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:21,120
I had to do a lot of research so I actually knew what I was talking about when I wrote all that stuff.

1940
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,540
I have a question about this.

1941
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:24,960
Okay.

1942
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:31,600
Do you think that she's already set in motion the plan to betray Gendo before this all happens?

1943
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:32,720
Or do you think she does it now?

1944
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,720
No, I think she does it while she's programming the computer.

1945
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:40,080
But in this sequence or previous before that she was put in the brig?

1946
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,860
I think in this sequence.

1947
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,920
Because in the episode in the series where she actually goes into the Magi,

1948
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,900
she hasn't become disenfranchised from Gendo yet.

1949
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:57,840
There used to be a very interesting Ritsuko-Kowaru connection

1950
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,620
that was highlighted in the animated series just a little bit.

1951
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:04,060
It was just touched, and nothing ever really came of it.

1952
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,340
Anybody should go through the director's versions of the last few episodes

1953
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,640
and see if there's anything new there.

1954
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,140
I haven't gotten that far in my copy yet.

1955
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,820
Because they must have gotten Quadra from somewhere.

1956
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,440
Someone postulated that they got it from Ritsuko.

1957
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:20,380
What do you mean?

1958
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,700
That it's part Lilith, part Ritsuko?

1959
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,980
The same way that Rey is from...

1960
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,620
Oh, you mean like, oh, do you think Ritsuko's mother?

1961
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,760
Either Ritsuko's mother or Ritsuko herself.

1962
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,500
She had, we're not really,

1963
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,220
there's been some postulation both ways.

1964
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,040
It's been around the argument table before.

1965
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,400
Interesting.

1966
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:35,900
Yeah.

1967
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:41,960
It's, again, just another question that they will never answer with this film.

1968
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:49,140
Yeah, there are some people who say that this is Anno's way of saying up yours to the fans.

1969
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,360
Because after he finished the series, he got a lot of death threats.

1970
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:58,200
And so apparently he sort of said, okay, fine, you want another ending? Here you go.

1971
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,280
And came up with this incredibly disturbing movie.

1972
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,120
It's kind of fun.

1973
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:06,980
The entire fan wish list really does come true in this way.

1974
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,980
You get to see Asuka kick some butt.

1975
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,800
You get to see everybody kind of come together, all these relationships resolve.

1976
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,440
But in the most horribly

1977
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:17,120
painful, unsatisfactory...

1978
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:17,840
It's

1979
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,800
like a deal with the devil.

1980
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:20,000
You know what I mean?

1981
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:21,220
You get everything you would ever

1982
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:23,040
wish for, but it's all...

1983
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,800
But it's all just gone wrong.

1984
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,000
It's gone horribly awry.

1985
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,900
This is Keel, Tom Booker, who we met through Second City.

1986
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,860
He's a

1987
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:36,100
very, very wonderful, very funny guy.

1988
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,960
You've seen him in commercials and whatnot.

1989
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,980
He's a very talented actor, and he enjoyed playing Keel.

1990
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,840
Showtime, ladies.

1991
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:46,040
I love that line.

1992
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:46,680
Okay, this is our

1993
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,940
friend Riley Barber,

1994
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:51,760
who is also an accomplished stand-up comic.

1995
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,980
He travels the world doing comedy,

1996
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,320
and I love the way he delivers that line.

1997
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,040
And I don't know why I wrote it that way,

1998
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:06,560
Showtime ladies, I just, for some reason I just kept thinking of some really tough as

1999
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:13,600
nails sergeant who always refers to the guys, you know, his special elite corps as

2000
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:13,740
"Come

2001
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:19,720
on ladies, let's go kick some butt" kind of thing. So, again, strictly for my own amusement,

2002
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,600
but I think it worked.

2003
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,380
Well, it's gotta be amazing Kazangas to think you could take Nerve. I mean, you gotta think

2004
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:31,160
of the people they were sending in to take this place out. This is the front of

2005
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,920
angel attack. This

2006
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:33,300
is not

2007
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,100
the NWL.

2008
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,000
This is not Kuwait.

2009
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,160
These are people with guns.

2010
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,220
Amy does a great job of capturing

2011
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:40,940
Buki's whole

2012
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:43,460
Buki's

2013
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,240
like us. The viewer.

2014
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,040
She is the viewer's voice, I think.

2015
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,660
She speaks what we're thinking.

2016
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:51,020
You know, anytime

2017
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,340
there's an Ava eating something it shouldn't be eating

2018
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,240
she's the one that shows the disgust and the

2019
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:55,940
fear.

2020
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:57,360
She's

2021
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,500
the most human of them all.

2022
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,900
That was such a grunty death.

2023
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,140
He didn't actually stab

2024
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:03,280
him.

2025
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,140
It was a Carl's Jr. sandwich.

2026
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,300
It got all over the place.

2027
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,520
If you have the DVD where this thing gets shot, this truck,

2028
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,180
if

2029
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,760
you go back and forth, you can make it.

2030
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,820
It looks like it's coming alive.

2031
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,440
And our

2032
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,120
punchy moments while we were recording this,

2033
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,480
we had a lot of fun with the sound tech.

2034
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,060
Keith Aram, our sound tech on that portion of it,

2035
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:27,260
we just had a blast.

2036
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,640
I think we laughed harder than we had any right to at that point.

2037
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,740
But you can make him, the truck, kind of jump and come alive.

2038
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:35,180
It's great.

2039
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,700
Again, with a movie that's so hardcore and so serious

2040
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,180
that there's times when you just have to escape

2041
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,680
from the gravity of the situation,

2042
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:49,180
and that's when we usually start messing around.

2043
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:49,760
Which is why we're all

2044
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,320
being funny right now as well.

2045
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,180
This is one of the most horrific pieces of violence

2046
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,360
I think it's certainly ever put to sell, if not film.

2047
01:24:59,340 --> 01:24:59,640
Absolutely.

2048
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,420
And you

2049
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,720
can only see it so many hundreds of times

2050
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:04,460
before you just have to start laughing as a defense mechanism.

2051
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,300
And if you're listening to this commentary,

2052
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,720
you probably have seen it a couple hundred

2053
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,560
times at this point,

2054
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:09,640
so laugh with us.

2055
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:11,020
Share the laughter.

2056
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,880
Okay, I have to point something out.

2057
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,540
Whenever they draw Ray...

2058
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,400
Now, she's obviously naked, so I understand.

2059
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,600
But whenever they draw Ray on a poster,

2060
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:24,240
they always show her little hiney crack from behind.

2061
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,300
doesn't matter clothes, whatever.

2062
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:30,240
They always make a point of showing Ray's little hiney.

2063
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,560
I don't understand that.

2064
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,380
So now, what were you saying about the seven pools?

2065
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:35,640
Oh, okay.

2066
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,560
Yeah, that, she was kind of sitting in this LCL pool right there.

2067
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,460
It was kind of shaped out as the Kabbalistic tree of life,

2068
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,300
kind of a close modern one.

2069
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,620
And it's a little off, but we kind of figured out

2070
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,340
she's sitting in what is called Yasad,

2071
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,120
which is this one particular sphere of this map of the universe.

2072
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,420
And it's the

2073
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:58,280
Hebrew for hot tub, I think.

2074
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,240
I'm sorry.

2075
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,780
It's very much, it's the gateway of death.

2076
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,900
It's the doorway into the dream realm, into the ethereal.

2077
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,700
She is on the cusp of death.

2078
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,160
She is ready to cross out of this world into the next,

2079
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,580
if we are to read it that way, which, I don't know.

2080
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:14,800
I'd like a full shape that way.

2081
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:15,600
But yes, of course we

2082
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,500
have to read it that way.

2083
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:16,880
Why not?

2084
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,360
This film is meticulous in its ability to be completely

2085
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,080
incomprehensible.

2086
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,420
delights in disturbing and confusing its viewers.

2087
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,460
Violence, on the other hand, we can all

2088
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:30,760
understand.

2089
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:31,480
We understand that.

2090
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,680
That's pretty easy to get

2091
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:32,880
through.

2092
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,560
We got our Greek chorus.

2093
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,700
Again, yes.

2094
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,420
Just telling us everything.

2095
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,660
Everything we want to know about what's going on.

2096
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:45,840
And then some.

2097
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,060
Towson has wonderful

2098
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:47,440
diagrams.

2099
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,200
Oh, here's some

2100
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:48,580
wonderful...

2101
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,280
Kimberly Yates.

2102
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,700
Kimberly Yates dying.

2103
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:52,920
Oh, oh,

2104
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:53,420
oh, oh!

2105
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,400
This I added strictly for my own amusement.

2106
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,140
I didn't think...

2107
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:58,840
Ooh, here it comes.

2108
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,040
Yay!

2109
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,960
Because otherwise it's just like this random person

2110
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:03,740
blasting him with flame.

2111
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,620
That's the only thing we altered from the original Japanese.

2112
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,240
Otherwise,

2113
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,100
honest to God,

2114
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:12,260
we tried to do word for word the same as the original.

2115
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,900
We really tried to...

2116
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:17,940
It was almost more of just a translation

2117
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,820
than an adaptation.

2118
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:20,820
You know?

2119
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,620
Now we have the Blake.

2120
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,680
When I first saw this, I thought they were just filling the place with LCL or something.

2121
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,880
But this is fast, fast-drying plastic.

2122
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,940
Really good idea to keep people out.

2123
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,220
That didn't work.

2124
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,280
Well, no, it didn't work.

2125
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:33,840
Didn't work.

2126
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:34,860
That won't work.

2127
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:35,600
No.

2128
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:35,940
No.

2129
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,280
I wish they would show how they got through that, though.

2130
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,220
I was always kind of curious.

2131
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,400
How exactly did they get through the liquid

2132
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:41,780
plastic?

2133
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,080
They just had the lighter up to it.

2134
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:47,700
You don't think?

2135
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:48,300
Well.

2136
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,600
No, we never got to see, did we?

2137
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,800
Allison is so awesome.

2138
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:55,080
She

2139
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,660
plays the

2140
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,900
most amazing badass.

2141
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:57,940
She really took

2142
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,040
off of this particular section of the film, really.

2143
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,200
She got to shine.

2144
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,260
Oh, dear.

2145
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:13,220
This is kind of where you get to see the relationship between Aoba

2146
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:13,460
and the

2147
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,120
rest of the staff.

2148
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:17,040
He's definitely the cynic, like, dude, we're all going to die.

2149
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:23,200
This is just cranky and he's the fatalist of the bunch.

2150
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:27,180
Basically because he has no action on the side.

2151
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:29,980
He gets no love at all of all the characters in

2152
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:30,360
this show.

2153
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,600
This is really the most involved they ever, the three of them, really get.

2154
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,700
This is a real kind of dirty, filthy deal they have to

2155
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,180
deal with here.

2156
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,660
This scene particularly with Ibuki definitely captures his character.

2157
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,460
Sort of no patience for weakness.

2158
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,820
Well, this line here.

2159
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,200
You kill or you die.

2160
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,380
You kill or you die.

2161
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,640
If I'm, you know,

2162
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,060
Oba's such a minor character in the series in a way,

2163
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,400
and if I ever get asked to repeat a line,

2164
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:58,600
it's

2165
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,260
always that line.

2166
01:28:59,380 --> 01:28:59,980
You kill or you

2167
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:00,360
die.

2168
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,540
So it's...

2169
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,480
Those are Ray innards.

2170
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,480
That's the disintegrated clone tank.

2171
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,360
Chamber of Guff.

2172
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,300
Chamber of Guff,

2173
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:09,580
yeah.

2174
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,360
Not the antechamber, right?

2175
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:13,760
Well, that's...

2176
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,180
Because it's bodies

2177
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:14,700
but no souls.

2178
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,260
Well, I

2179
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,100
suppose so.

2180
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:21,640
It would be worth, God, if anyone ever finds out exactly where that is,

2181
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,520
and if they can quote it to me, I will be so happy.

2182
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,080
And I looked for this symbol, and I cannot tell what they are standing on.

2183
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:30,460
Gendo has the Tree of Life in his office.

2184
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,780
You can see that pretty clearly.

2185
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,020
I believe he's sitting at Kether.

2186
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:34,840
I might be wrong with that.

2187
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:39,180
But it would make sense that he would put himself at the godhead of the I am in control.

2188
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,740
Oh, you're about to die.

2189
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,100
There you are, Taliesin.

2190
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,920
Ooh, you're dead.

2191
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,800
Wait, wait, no, I'm not quite, okay.

2192
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,200
Okay.

2193
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,040
Go, go for a walk.

2194
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,660
It gets so silly just dying for a day.

2195
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,060
Just

2196
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:55,300
dying.

2197
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:55,980
For money, yeah.

2198
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:56,840
Dying for money.

2199
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,220
Now this originally...

2200
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,400
There's a taluson right there

2201
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:02,580
as well.

2202
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,220
Taluson once again.

2203
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,440
Did a beautiful job with this.

2204
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,520
It's funny, it was originally...

2205
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,100
You gotta love that.

2206
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:10,380
Ow!

2207
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:12,400
Oh, this is wonderful.

2208
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,940
we added a sound effect when she blows his brains out.

2209
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,580
I don't know if you can hear it, but...

2210
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,640
You hear that little...

2211
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,380
We added that itch because it was so disgusting and wonderful.

2212
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:24,300
Now, it's funny.

2213
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:28,260
Originally, when I sort of envisioned this section of the movie

2214
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,320
with the guy holding the gun,

2215
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,060
I sort of envisioned this horrible guy

2216
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,180
who eats babies for breakfast kind of thing.

2217
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:34,900
Sorry, kid.

2218
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,320
And then Taliesin came in and did that read,

2219
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,140
and I was like, oh, that's even colder.

2220
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:39,940
I love it.

2221
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,680
Now, how significant is the number 667 at this point?

2222
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,640
The Neighbor of the Beast.

2223
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:43,900
The

2224
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:44,420
Neighbor of

2225
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:44,820
the Beast.

2226
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,560
He gets the Beast's mail occasionally.

2227
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,980
Sometimes the Beast's

2228
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,200
dog comes peas in his garden.

2229
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,240
He just made this movie for people to freeze frame it

2230
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,260
and go through it frame by frame and find things.

2231
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:03,720
It's this wonderful artistry mind screw at the same

2232
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:03,920
time.

2233
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:09,180
Yeah.

2234
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:16,500
Especially like in this scene, I think Spike was a little fed up with Shinji, I think.

2235
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:22,600
But he found his way back to identifying with him and portraying the character.

2236
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:24,100
I mean, Spike really did a brilliant job.

2237
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:27,800
I cannot imagine anyone else doing as good a job with Shinji.

2238
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,240
I can't imagine a more depressing role to take

2239
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,240
to try

2240
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,780
and deal with this day in and day out.

2241
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,640
The classic anti-hero.

2242
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,820
If he could be bothered even to be that.

2243
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:42,260
Yeah.

2244
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,140
It's part of what I really, really have always loved about this film is that I don't like him,

2245
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:54,080
but there's so many things in him that I don't like that I don't like about myself.

2246
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,660
There's so many places where I see exactly where he fails, and you can't fight it.

2247
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:58,820
You

2248
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:01,960
can't really disagree with it.

2249
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:02,960
Here's the big boom.

2250
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:04,980
Butt shaker.

2251
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:06,780
Oh, wait, here we go.

2252
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,360
Here's my second favorite line ever in this whole movie.

2253
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:10,100
Hold on.

2254
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,020
Oh, come on.

2255
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,040
Here we go.

2256
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:19,880
Speak of the devil.

2257
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:20,620
Damn,

2258
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,900
haven't you ever heard of moderation?

2259
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,500
Yes!

2260
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:24,380
I

2261
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,520
love that line.

2262
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:26,720
I love that line.

2263
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:27,940
They're just

2264
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,720
things, no matter how many times I see this movie,

2265
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,600
they're just some things that still make me happy.

2266
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:31,920
The

2267
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,120
room pauses every time that line comes

2268
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:34,260
up.

2269
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,180
We all wait

2270
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,300
for your squeal.

2271
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:37,440
For me, going, yee-hee.

2272
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:39,160
Did we already go past BC Weapon?

2273
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:40,860
Yeah, I guess we already had the...

2274
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:42,500
You guys know what BC Weapons...

2275
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:43,040
Biochemical.

2276
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:43,800
Biochemical.

2277
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:44,360
Yep.

2278
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,120
I'm telling you, honey, the amount of research I did

2279
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:50,700
before even setting pen to paper to write the script was ridiculous.

2280
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,440
It took me about a good four months to do this script.

2281
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:55,920
Because I wanted to make

2282
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,000
sure that I had everything down.

2283
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,020
So these are all spinal columns, basically?

2284
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:01,480
This

2285
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,500
is the Eva graveyard.

2286
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:06,140
These are prototypes that didn't work.

2287
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,200
So this is a place where rednecks could go in with their own tools

2288
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,540
and maybe put their own Ava together.

2289
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,240
Exactly. Build your own Ava.

2290
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:24,840
Yes, there really is almost a coherent thing going on with the Avas

2291
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,480
where they almost quite pull the whole thing together

2292
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,840
and it makes almost perfect sense.

2293
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,280
And it would almost fake you to believe that you can figure everything out.

2294
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,560
Oh, and we have the office.

2295
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:36,260
I want a pendulum that big one day.

2296
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,280
Yeah, that always sort of...

2297
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:41,460
I looked at this and I was trying to figure out what the perspective

2298
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:42,240
is on it.

2299
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,920
Are we looking through a clock? Are we looking down a hall?

2300
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:45,560
Or does he

2301
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:49,040
really just have this ginormous pendulum in the middle of his room

2302
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:51,460
that if you get

2303
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,480
up to try and clean a window, it could take you out?

2304
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,840
I mean, what is that thing?

2305
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:59,980
I had somebody once mention that there are three columns of light in this room

2306
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:04,020
and that that might represent the three columns from the cabal of the middle pillar,

2307
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,440
the pillar of mercy and the pillar of severity,

2308
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,340
and he's sitting at the very bottom right down there

2309
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:12,540
in the most earthly, practical place

2310
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,960
where so many of our problems come from.

2311
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,200
This little mayor.

2312
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,600
He's got some kind of...

2313
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,420
He's just an official.

2314
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:18,160
He's not Sealy.

2315
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:18,820
He's not anybody.

2316
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,280
He's a prime minister.

2317
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:22,020
He's a prime minister.

2318
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:23,640
He's kind of cut off from this whole deal.

2319
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,400
It could be the three columns lighter.

2320
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,100
It could be just they were trying to save money

2321
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:27,960
for the action sequence.

2322
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,160
Sometimes a window

2323
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:30,860
is just a window.

2324
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,180
Exactly.

2325
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,200
And you often find if you play that sequence,

2326
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,220
for your cats, they will try to chase the pendulum.

2327
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,500
And here we're going to get into

2328
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,400
some major action once Asuka

2329
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:45,840
kind of gets out of her...

2330
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:46,880
Out of her funk.

2331
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:49,460
This was an interesting... Will you talk about

2332
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,800
directing Tiffany through this sequence?

2333
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,320
Tiffany did an amazing job

2334
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:56,300
with this because it's a very,

2335
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,400
very difficult transition to go

2336
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,420
from completely insane

2337
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,060
inside your head

2338
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:04,300
to

2339
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:04,720
Absolutely.

2340
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,960
She goes from completely suicidally depressed

2341
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,380
to the most confident,

2342
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,980
always beautiful character in the movie for just a few moments.

2343
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,920
And then she kind of gets torn up and dies.

2344
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:25,860
But Tiffany did a wonderful job with this.

2345
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,780
Just the emotion behind it.

2346
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:30,820
It was beautiful.

2347
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:33,540
And actually, when I saw her in the booth,

2348
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,780
She would actually physicalize the lines.

2349
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,320
I think that, I mean, you have to ask Tiffany,

2350
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,940
I would imagine that playing this role must have been pretty exhausting.

2351
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,420
But she definitely did a good job.

2352
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:51,880
Especially the, I mean, this line, I don't want to die, is repeated.

2353
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:56,540
I mean, I'm sure somebody has counted it out somewhere, but it's...

2354
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,540
I did, I don't remember how many times.

2355
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,080
Too many times.

2356
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,340
Oh, and then the voice of Asuka's mother was done by Kimberly Yates.

2357
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:06,940
who I think did a brilliant job.

2358
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,780
You've got to freeze frame that sequence right there

2359
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,380
with the worms on the...

2360
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,820
Yeah, there's one, like, for two frames

2361
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,920
you see a picture of Asuka's corpse

2362
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,260
and it's all maggot-written

2363
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,860
and she's in the plug suit.

2364
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:20,800
It's really vile.

2365
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:23,220
That'll give you some good nightmares

2366
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,320
for the weeks to

2367
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,640
come.

2368
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:26,580
Here she goes.

2369
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,020
Now she's going to go kick some butt.

2370
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:28,920
Yeah!

2371
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,300
This was a big complaint with fans for the TV series.

2372
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:37,800
They felt that Oscar got taken out of the picture before we really got to see her go at it, so to speak.

2373
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:42,540
Also, remember, this is around the Titanic time, I might add, so this just becomes funnier.

2374
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:49,080
That would make me so happy to think there'd be a little tiny Leonardo DiCaprio in there just getting smushed.

2375
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,520
I'm never going to work in Hollywood, am I?

2376
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,180
No, you're not.

2377
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:54,460
I'm

2378
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:55,660
done. I'm done.

2379
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,060
Leo's fine. His AT field saved him.

2380
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:05,920
This is really, it's the best we ever get to see an Ava really go at it.

2381
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,520
They never have ever animated anything with this much action, this much movement.

2382
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,060
It's a beautifully, beautifully animated fight sequence.

2383
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,160
A little Macross montage right there.

2384
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,460
One of my favorites.

2385
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,380
She's so happy, though.

2386
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:20,960
But that's the thing.

2387
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:23,580
She goes from suicidal to, she's bipolar, I think.

2388
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,740
Yeah, I think she can just not.

2389
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,180
I think if she catches it with her face.

2390
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,900
I think Xanax would be good for Asuka.

2391
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,480
A little Zoloft, a little Paxson, just something.

2392
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,940
comment on the metaphor right there.

2393
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,360
Oh, a big old wank in the face?

2394
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:35,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2395
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,860
A big old exploding

2396
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,900
wank in the face.

2397
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,060
I

2398
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:44,120
love that scene

2399
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:45,680
where she drives over the body

2400
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:47,340
and the arm goes...

2401
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:49,880
There's just some things in there

2402
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,640
that you're just like, oh, this is so sick.

2403
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,320
This is great. Rewind. Let me see that again.

2404
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,760
You know?

2405
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:57,600
Battery power.

2406
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,120
That's another thing I always like.

2407
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:05,060
The Avas are, in fact, if you pull the plug, they've got five minutes, give or take, depending on the plot line.

2408
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:10,400
Great way to keep them in this one centralized location.

2409
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,760
Great way to keep everything tied together.

2410
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:21,060
This is really, especially for the time, you don't really notice it now because there's so many other shows out that are trying to be Evangelion.

2411
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:21,860
Oh, yeah.

2412
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,980
Nothing like this had really ever been seen before.

2413
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:27,780
Oh, right there, Tiffany said, eat this ashloch.

2414
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:32,980
That was Tiffany's writing, actually, because I just sort of said, what's an obnoxious word in German?

2415
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,620
And because we'd already said Schweinhund.

2416
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,300
And so then she came up with Aschloch, which I think is fairly self-explanatory.

2417
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,000
I don't think I need to translate that.

2418
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,220
Kids, go ask your parents.

2419
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,160
That's

2420
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,000
what the Internet's for.

2421
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:48,780
Exactly.

2422
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:57,180
Exactly.

2423
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:04,440
Do you guys remember, um, uh, oh, did you see

2424
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,060
that side, Quarrow on the side?

2425
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:09,200
These things look like, do you guys remember the cartoon characters, the Shmoo?

2426
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:11,400
Shmoo, yes.

2427
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:11,980
From Heddle Barber.

2428
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:16,620
There's something about the shape of the heads on the Emma series makes me think of a Shmoo.

2429
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:21,400
Makes me think of the Mountain Dew Extreme commercials where a guy sky surfs and go catches a Mountain Dew in the middle of it.

2430
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,000
You know, I mean, they've got their little surfboards.

2431
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:26,400
It looks like the head of a porpoise, too.

2432
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:31,620
And I never understood why they engineered them with these luscious lips.

2433
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,060
Do you know what I mean?

2434
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,720
It's downright terrifying.

2435
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:37,780
They are the most frightening.

2436
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:41,460
Ava's in drag with that lipstick.

2437
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,200
Ah!

2438
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:45,240
指先は私を求める

2439
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:49,160
私に帰

2440
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:54,440
りなさい 生まれる前に

2441
01:40:55,340 --> 01:41:00,800
あなたが過ごした大地へと

2442
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:09,980
この手に帰りなさい 巡り合うため

2443
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:14,420
The miracles will happen, no matter what ever

2444
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,800
The soul of the Rufura

2445
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:59,760
I'm going to go to

2446
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:06,980
the

2447
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:23,100
I'm the soul of the love

2448
01:42:53,280 --> 01:43:05,360
I'm going to

2449
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:27,920
The world

2450
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:39,200
is

2451
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,160
born

2452
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:54,100
I'm still feeling calm and calm

2453
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,160
I'm trying to ask my life

2454
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:03,940
I'm asking for my life

2455
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,360
My指先 is asking for me

2456
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,820
I'm going to be back to

2457
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:15,140
my life

2458
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,320
I'm living before you

2459
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:24,360
You have to go to the forest

2460
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:28,720
Come back to this hand

2461
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,400
To meet you

2462
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,660
The miracle will happen to you

2463
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:43,640
The world will be the "Ruflar"

2464
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,040
Thank you.

2465
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:22,860
I will return to

2466
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:46,200
the first place to the first place in the world.

2467
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,200
I'm the soul of

2468
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:18,720
I'm

2469
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,140
going to go back

2470
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,300
The soul of

2471
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,440
the soul

2472
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:05,780
The skin of the blue sky is filled with the skin

2473
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:39,340
*outro music*
