1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,580
Speaker 1: The young man like a young man

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,700
Speaker 1: You are a young man, you are a young man

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
Speaker 1: The wind is now on the door

4
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at you

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:01:03,560
Speaker 1: I'm so happy

6
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,380
Speaker 2: This

7
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,540
Speaker 3: is Ecta64 calling the

8
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Speaker 2: end of the world.

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,400
Speaker 2: Neopat 400, confirm cumulonimbus clouds in your immediate flight path, over.

10
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,700
Speaker 2: This is Neopat 400, cumulonimbus clouds confirmed.

11
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,380
Speaker 2: Parameter indicates no hazard.

12
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,060
Speaker 2: We'll maintain course. Expect to arrive on schedule.

13
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,060
Speaker 2: This is Ecta 64. Roger it out.

14
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,900
Speaker 4: I'm ready. Where's Asuka?

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,660
Speaker 4: She's taken off already.

16
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,020
Speaker 4: It would seem that

17
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,960
Speaker 5: she doesn't want to face us right now.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,960
Speaker 5: But why?

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,580
Speaker 5: A teenage girl can be difficult to understand, Shinji.

20
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,340
Speaker 3: By the way...

21
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,480
Speaker 3: Um, well...

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,760
Speaker 4: Well, go ahead.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,680
Speaker 4: Are the rumors about Unit 4 really true?

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,060
Speaker 4: I heard that there was some kind of accident and it exploded.

25
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,300
Speaker 5: Yes, I'm afraid so.

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,900
Speaker 5: Unit 4 is gone, alone with the second branch of nerve.

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Speaker 5: It happened while they were testing the S2 engine.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
Speaker 5: But don't worry, we'll be all right.

29
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,400
Speaker 5: All three of our Avas are functioning properly,

30
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,160
Speaker 5: And our pilots

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,580
Speaker 4: and staff are in good shape, too.

32
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,260
Speaker 4: I also heard that Unit 3 is being brought here.

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,280
Speaker 4: You're performing the activation tests at Matsushiro, aren't you?

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:40,960
Speaker 5: Uh-huh.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,380
Speaker 5: I'll be out for four days or so, but don't worry.

36
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,060
Speaker 5: Akashi's coming over to take care of you guys.

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,340
Speaker 4: But what about the test?

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,500
Speaker 5: Oh, Ritsuko will be supervising everything.

39
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,920
Speaker 5: There won't be any problems.

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,120
Speaker 4: And who will be the pilot?

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,999
Speaker 5: Well, the pilot is...

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,600
Speaker 6: Yes.

43
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,720
Speaker 6: Good morning, Major Katsuragi. I've come to ask for your help.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Speaker 6: I'm begging you. Please, please.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,940
Speaker 6: You've just got to choose me as the pilot for Evangelion Unit 3. You gotta!

46
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,040
Speaker 7: So, Shinji still doesn't know, huh?

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,980
Speaker 7: I just can't find a chance to tell him. I'm worried.

48
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,740
Speaker 7: Sometimes I just can't figure out what he's

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,300
Speaker 5: thinking about.

50
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,940
Speaker 5: Oh,

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,240
Speaker 7: get a grip, kid. You're the one who wanted to be his guardian.

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,500
Speaker 5: Yeah, you're right, of course.

53
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,960
Speaker 5: Um, so, when will you acquire the new pilot?

54
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,900
Speaker 7: Tomorrow. There's still a few details to be ironed out.

55
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,660
Speaker 7: Maybe the new pilot will tell Shinji himself.

56
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,460
Speaker 7: Oh, I rather doubt it. This one wasn't very enthused about the prospect at all.

57
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,600
Speaker 7: He won't talk. He only accepted under the condition that his younger sister be transferred into our private hospital.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Speaker 6: How can Miss Otto be so cruel?

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,860
Speaker 6: I'm dying to be pilot, so why won't she use me?

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,780
Speaker 6: Even as a backup pilot, it's just not fair.

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,660
Speaker 8: Yeah.

62
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,140
Speaker 4: Hey, what's up?

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,640
Speaker 4: You left before me, but you're getting here late.

64
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,640
Speaker 8: No fight between the newlyweds today?

65
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,360
Speaker 9: I just didn't want to see your ugly faces!

66
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,700
Speaker 9: You damn three students!

67
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,340
Speaker 9: Oh, for dust, idiot!

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,200
Speaker 6: Ow!

69
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,420
Speaker 6: Ow!

70
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:30,700
Speaker 6: Ow!

71
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,900
Speaker 6: Ah, the precious moment of lunchtime.

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,680
Speaker 6: Hey, where's Toji?

73
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,060
Speaker 6: I haven't seen him.

74
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,620
Speaker 6: You mean he left?

75
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,040
Speaker 6: Without his lunch?

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,440
Speaker 6: Toji the stomach?

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,480
Speaker 4: That's impossible!

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,960
Speaker 4: Well, he's been acting different.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,920
Speaker 4: Mr. Susahoe?

80
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,180
Speaker 8: Oh, it's you, Ayanami.

81
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,680
Speaker 8: If you're looking for Shinji, he's not here.

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,640
Speaker 8: You know, don't you, about everything?

83
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,760
Speaker 8: I think Asuka knows, too.

84
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,060
Speaker 8: So Shinji's the only one who doesn't know.

85
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,060
Speaker 8: You know, it's pretty rare for you to be concerned about someone else.

86
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,880
Speaker 10: It is? I'm not sure I understand.

87
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,580
Speaker 8: Oh, you have a thing about Shinji, all right.

88
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,600
Speaker 10: I? Maybe that

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,080
Speaker 4: is true.

90
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,380
Speaker 8: You do.

91
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,880
Speaker 4: - Hikari! - Let's have lunch

92
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,140
Speaker 5: together!

93
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,340
Speaker 5: Okay.

94
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,380
Speaker 5: He's over two hours late,

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,700
Speaker 7: but at last he's finally here.

96
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,380
Speaker 7: This is the first time I've ever waited for someone this long.

97
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,500
Speaker 7: That's because you never waited for guys back when you could still get a date.

98
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,380
Speaker 7: Oh, shut up.

99
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,100
Speaker 11: This was the so-called second impact.

100
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,640
Speaker 11: At that time, I was living in a place called Nebukawa,

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Speaker 11: but the rising water levels caused by the melting of Antarctica

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,520
Speaker 11: have buried it beneath the sea.

103
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Speaker 8: I'm sorry, newcomer, but I had to clobber you.

104
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,240
Speaker 8: I had to beat you to work off my own anger.

105
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,320
Speaker 10: Um, I'm sorry, Asuka.

106
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,640
Speaker 10: You usually walk home with Shinji, don't you?

107
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,260
Speaker 9: I only walk with Shinji because we work together.

108
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,720
Speaker 9: And right now I don't be like looking at him.

109
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,440
Speaker 9: Oh.

110
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,300
Speaker 10: This is about

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,520
Speaker 9: Toji, isn't it?

112
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,620
Speaker 9: Yeah, how'd you know?

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,940
Speaker 9: Everybody knows.

114
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,800
Speaker 9: The Three Stooges are the only ones who don't.

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,260
Speaker 10: Shinji seems sensitive in a naive kind

116
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,580
Speaker 9: of way.

117
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,200
Speaker 9: Shinji's a big fat dork!

118
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,080
Speaker 9: And he's denser than lead, too.

119
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,100
Speaker 9: He wouldn't know how to relate to another person if you gave him a manual!

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 10: Oh, I

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,560
Speaker 9: see.

122
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,500
Speaker 10: Asuka?

123
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,960
Speaker 10: I think that Toji might be interested in Rei.

124
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Speaker 10: Are you kidding?

125
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,560
Speaker 10: Toji and Wonder Girl?

126
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,460
Speaker 10: Well, lunch, they

127
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,220
Speaker 9: seem...

128
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,100
Speaker 9: Don't worry, Hikari.

129
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,960
Speaker 9: It'll never happen.

130
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,600
Speaker 9: If Shinji is denser than lead, then Rei Ayanami is off the atomic scale.

131
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,700
Speaker 9: Really?

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,800
Speaker 9: Yep.

133
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,120
Hmm.

134
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,460
Speaker 12: Can I ask you something?

135
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,340
Speaker 12: Okay.

136
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,280
Speaker 12: Just what do you see in a dumb jock like that?

137
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,920
Speaker 12: Is

138
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Speaker 10: the...

139
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Speaker 10: passionate side.

140
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,240
Speaker 10: What?

141
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,740
It was a mistake to get back with you.

142
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,920
How can you say that now?

143
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,100
There are a lot of pit holes in life,

144
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
but you just have to dig your way out.

145
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,020
Speaker 9: You know, Asuka...

146
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,600
Speaker 9: Kashi sure spends a lot of time in the tub.

147
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,880
Speaker 4: I wonder who's going to pilot Unit 3.

148
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,280
Speaker 9: What? You mean you haven't heard?

149
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,640
Speaker 4: Who is it?

150
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,500
Speaker 4: Yes.

151
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,700
The only reason I came back to you

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,180
so we could break up again.

153
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,220
Speaker 9: I don't know.

154
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,500
Speaker 13: Yeah, that was refreshing.

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,700
Speaker 13: Are you two fighting again?

156
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,860
Speaker 13: I don't believe it.

157
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,240
Speaker 13: Are you two always like this whenever Katsuragi's gone?

158
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Speaker 13: It's not like

159
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,040
Speaker 14: that.

160
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,180
Speaker 14: I want to be happy, Kaji,

161
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,320
Speaker 14: especially since you're spending the night,

162
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,760
Speaker 14: but I can't.

163
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,760
Speaker 14: Not tonight.

164
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,260
Speaker 14: Not now.

165
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,740
Speaker 14: Not with everything.

166
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Speaker 13: I understand.

167
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,240
Speaker 13: Let's go to bed.

168
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,500
Speaker 13: I find that's usually the best thing to do

169
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,540
Speaker 13: in this kind of situation.

170
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,660
Speaker 4: Hey, are you asleep yet, Gachi?

171
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,860
Speaker 13: No, not yet.

172
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,360
Speaker 4: Well, can you tell me what my father's like?

173
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,020
Speaker 13: Well, there's a surprise question.

174
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,640
Speaker 13: I would have thought you'd have asked about Katsuragi.

175
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,500
Speaker 4: It seems like you're always with my father.

176
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,660
Speaker 13: Commander Fuyutsuki is the one who's always with him.

177
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,640
Speaker 13: Have you been asking around about your father?

178
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,380
Speaker 13: I

179
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,840
Speaker 4: just haven't been around him much.

180
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Speaker 13: So, you really don't know him.

181
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,720
Speaker 4: But I've learned a lot about him lately.

182
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,820
Speaker 4: I've learned how he feels about his work.

183
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,060
Speaker 4: About my

184
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,380
Speaker 13: mother.

185
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,320
Speaker 13: No, you're wrong, Shinji.

186
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,040
Speaker 13: You only believe that you've learned.

187
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,220
Speaker 13: But people really can't understand themselves, much less each other.

188
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,040
Speaker 13: Understanding 100% of anything is impossible.

189
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,660
Speaker 13: That's why we spend so much time trying to understand our own motivations

190
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,200
Speaker 13: and those of others. That's what makes life so interesting.

191
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
Speaker 4: So you can't understand Misato either.

192
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,200
Speaker 13: The kanji that we use for the word she means a woman far away, and women will always seem

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Speaker 13: to be on a distant shore. The gulf that separates male and female is broader and deeper than

194
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,600
Speaker 13: any ocean.

195
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,680
Speaker 4: I just don't understand

196
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,140
Speaker 13: adults.

197
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,660
Speaker 1: T-minus 300 minutes to Unit 3 activation test.

198
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,580
Speaker 15: Primary power standing by.

199
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,320
Speaker 1: Repairs to left arm crimp log completed.

200
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,960
Speaker 1: Returning system in all sections of the unit.

201
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,340
Speaker 1: Roger. Team B, commence operation.

202
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,460
Speaker 15: Data link to Avangelion Unit 1 established.

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,120
Speaker 7: The system's all up and ready for full activation.

204
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,280
Speaker 7: Terrific. Let's get started.

205
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,780
Speaker 7: That was enthusiastic.

206
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,820
Speaker 7: You're aware that this unit will be assigned to your detachment once it's passed its tests, aren't you?

207
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,920
Speaker 7: Exclusive control of four Avas.

208
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,180
Speaker 7: If you wanted to, you could conquer the world.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,340
Speaker 7: So, have you told Shinji yet?

210
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,380
Speaker 7: I'll tell him after the test.

211
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,240
Speaker 5: The fourth child has arrived.

212
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,280
Speaker 5: Squad 2, begin entry preparations immediately.

213
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,020
Speaker 5: Toji

214
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,720
Speaker 10: hasn't shown up yet, Asuka.

215
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,620
Speaker 10: Yeah, he may not come today.

216
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,080
Speaker 10: I thought we might eat together today.

217
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,360
Speaker 10: Do you want this?

218
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,460
Speaker 6: Unit 3's already arrived in Japan, hasn't it?

219
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,460
Speaker 4: Yeah,

220
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,920
Speaker 6: it got here yesterday.

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,060
Speaker 6: This sucks. Who's going to pilot it then?

222
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,560
Speaker 6: Told you he was absent today. Maybe it's him.

223
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,320
Speaker 6: I don't think so.

224
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,940
Speaker 6: Entry flux

225
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 16: secure.

226
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,060
Speaker 16: Initiating burst connection.

227
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,820
Speaker 15: Transmitting pulse. Graph readout is normal.

228
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Speaker 16: All checklists up to 1350 have been cleared.

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Speaker 15: Phase 1 contact all cleared.

230
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,240
Speaker 7: Roger. Operation will proceed to Phase 2.

231
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,840
Speaker 15: Full nerve link established.

232
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,040
Speaker 15: Level is 10-5-5. Harmonics are reading standard.

233
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,420
Speaker 15: We are now approaching the absolute border.

234
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,900
Speaker 7: Break the nerve circuits! Abort the test!

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,540
Speaker 7: No! Mission

236
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,020
Speaker 3: failure! We've got high

237
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,100
Speaker 1: energy readings in

238
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,560
Speaker 14: the body!

239
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,440
Speaker 14: An angel!

240
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,800
Speaker 3: No!

241
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:34,880
Speaker 3: No!

242
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,620
Speaker 2: There's been an explosion in

243
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,320
Speaker 3: Matsushiro!

244
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,060
Speaker 3: Damage

245
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,700
Speaker 16: level unknown.

246
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,140
Speaker 2: Send the rescue squad in 3rd Battalion.

247
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,820
Speaker 2: We've gotta handle this before the self-defense force gets involved.

248
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,300
Speaker 17: Roger!

249
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,280
Speaker 17: We've got an unidentified object detected at the site.

250
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,400
Speaker 17: Its pattern is orange.

251
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,380
Speaker 17: We can't confirm that it's an angel yet.

252
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
Speaker 17: Go to first stage alert.

253
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,360
Speaker 18: All personnel, go to first stage alert.

254
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,480
Speaker 18: Prepare for surface-to-surface combat.

255
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,320
Speaker 18: All Avas, prepare for launch.

256
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,320
Speaker 18: First for maximum intercept potential.

257
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,880
Speaker 18: Air transportation to Matsushiro will go in 20.

258
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,260
Speaker 3: An accident

259
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,300
Speaker 4: in Matsushiro?

260
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,500
Speaker 4: It can't be.

261
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,860
Speaker 4: What happened

262
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,380
Speaker 9: to Misato?

263
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,480
Speaker 9: Contact hasn't been restored yet.

264
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,740
Speaker 4: What are we going to do? We need her.

265
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,860
Speaker 9: We're going to have to go for it ourselves.

266
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,300
Speaker 9: There aren't any other options left open for us, are there?

267
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Speaker 4: But how can we find an angel without her?

268
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,020
Speaker 16: Commander Curry will command this operation.

269
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
Speaker 6: My father will?

270
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,180
Speaker 6: We're receiving an image of the target from the Nobe Mountain Station.

271
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,940
Speaker 6: Transpiring to the main monitor.

272
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,700
Speaker 17: As we suspected.

273
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,960
Speaker 17: Transmit the abort signal. Eject the unit's entry plug.

274
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,020
Speaker 18: It's not working, sir. Neither the abort or plug ejection codes are being accepted.

275
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,260
Speaker 17: What about the pilot?

276
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,320
Speaker 17: His heart's still beating and he's still breathing. But he's probably...

277
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,080
Speaker 17: I see. Then we must accept the loss of Evangelion Unit 3. Reclassify it as the 13th Angel.

278
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,600
Speaker 7: What?

279
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,400
Speaker 7: But, sir...

280
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,540
Speaker 17: Deploy our forces around the base of Mount Nobe. The target must be destroyed.

281
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,480
Speaker 2: Target is approaching. All units, prepare to engage.

282
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,360
Speaker 19: Huh? It can't be.

283
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,940
Speaker 19: Is that the

284
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,240
Speaker 4: Angel?

285
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,560
Speaker 17: Correct. That is your target.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,160
Speaker 4: It may be our target, but it's also an Ava, isn't it?

287
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,620
Speaker 4: God damn him. How could it have been possessed?

288
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,700
Speaker 4: If that thing is an Ava, then there must be another pilot inside it, isn't there?

289
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,900
Speaker 3: You mean you still don't know that? The

290
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,320
pilot of Unit 3--

291
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,740
Speaker 3: Huh? Asuka?

292
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,220
Speaker 3: *Screams*

293
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,520
Speaker 19: *Screams*

294
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,680
Speaker 19: ASKUAAA!

295
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,560
Speaker 19: *Screams

296
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,420
*

297
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,860
*Screams*

298
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,720
Speaker 18: AVA Unit 2, cease transmitting!

299
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,820
Speaker 18: The pilot's ejected. Recovery teams are moving in for retrieval.

300
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,900
Speaker 18: Target is moving towards Unit 0's position.

301
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,760
Speaker 17: Ray, stop it, but avoid close range combat.

302
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,200
Speaker 17: I'll send Unit 1 in to support you.

303
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,920
Speaker 17: Yes, sir.

304
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Speaker 10: But the pilot is...

305
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,960
Speaker 18: The angel is merging itself into Unit Zero's arm!

306
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,640
Speaker 18: Nerve contamination spreading!

307
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,460
Speaker 17: Sever the left arm immediately.

308
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,300
Speaker 18: But the pilot's nerve connections are still active!

309
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
Speaker 17: Cut it off!

310
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:14,680
Speaker 18: Right.

311
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,180
Speaker 4: *Screams

312
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,060
*

313
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,180
Speaker 4: There's somebody inside it, isn't there?

314
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,540
Speaker 4: Another kid just like me.

315
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,460
Speaker 19: Oh, an injury plug.

316
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,740
Speaker 19: I knew it.

317
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,240
Speaker 19: I knew there was someone in there.

318
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,880
Speaker 15: You don't want life support systems failing!

319
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,740
Speaker 15: Pilot life functions are endangered!

320
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,400
Speaker 15: Damn it!

321
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,060
Speaker 15: Cut our pilot's seek ratio down to 60%!

322
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,800
Speaker 17: Belay that!

323
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,740
Speaker 17: But Akari, if we don't, the pilot could be killed.

324
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,920
Speaker 17: Shinji, why aren't you fighting?

325
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,120
Speaker 19: I can't!

326
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,520
Speaker 19: There's still a person inside that thing.

327
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,740
Speaker 17: Irrelevant. It's an angel. Destroy our enemy.

328
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,520
Speaker 19: I can't. If he's alive, we've got to help him.

329
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,440
Speaker 19: I can't kill another human being.

330
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,940
Speaker 17: It's him or you.

331
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,439
Speaker 19: No! I'd rather die!

332
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,319
Speaker 17: Damn it. Shut down all of Unit 1's synchronization circuits immediately.

333
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,800
Speaker 18: Shut them down?

334
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,420
Speaker 17: Correct. Switch all control to the dummy plug system.

335
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,699

336
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,300
Speaker 18: sir, the dummy plug isn't fully operational yet.

337
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,199
Speaker 18: Dr. Akagi hasn't approved its use!

338
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,579
Speaker 17: It's still better than the current pilot!

339
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,680
Speaker 17: Do it!

340
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,720
Speaker 17: Yes, sir.

341
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,200
Speaker 15: What's going on?

342
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,440
Speaker 15: What the hell are you doing, father?

343
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,620

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Speaker 16: Sir?

350
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,880

Speaker 17: *BANG*

352
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,780
Speaker 18: My god, is this what the dummy plug is for?

353
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,620
Gains are still increasing.

354
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,100
I'm gonna die.
