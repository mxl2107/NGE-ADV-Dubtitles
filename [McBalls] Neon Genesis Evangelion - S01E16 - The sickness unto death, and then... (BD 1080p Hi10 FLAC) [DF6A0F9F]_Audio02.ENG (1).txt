Speaker 1
The young man who is a sad thing You are a young man who is a fairy tale The wind is now on the I'll see you soon. I'll be shining in the sky I'll be a man, be a fairy tale!

*BANG* *BANG*

*BANG*

*BANG*

Speaker 2
Shinji, did you change the soup's flavor somehow?

Speaker 3
Yeah, I used dried fish stock. Ritsuko gave it to me.

Speaker 2
*BANG*

Speaker 4
*BANG* *BANG* It's too hot!

Speaker 3
I'm sorry.

Speaker 4
You're always apologizing! Do you really think it's your fault? Apologies are your condition reflex to any kind of confrontation, aren't they, Shinji? Don't you have any spine at all?

Speaker 3
I'm sorry.

Speaker 4
There you go again. Why do you always have to punish yourself for

Speaker 5
everything? There, there.

Speaker 4
That's just Shinji's way, you know. It's so easy for you just to accept his pathetic habits, isn't it? But don't you think you've been too easy on him lately? Have I? Maybe you and Kaji have hooked up again, but the fact that you're happy doesn't mean that you can just ignore the welfare of the rest

Speaker 5
of us. Look, there's nothing

Speaker 4
going on between me and Kaji.

Speaker 6
Hey, Katsuragi, I found a bar that serves a decent drink. How about tonight? Bye.

Speaker 4
I've never been around anyone who's been involved in such a totally indecent relationship. And you're supposed to be our guardian? What a hypocrite! It's disgusting!

Speaker 2
Meantime harmonics test, all systems green.

Speaker 6
Projected adjustment values have been cleared. You're looking pretty worn to the bone, Major Katsuragi.

Speaker 2
There's reasons why

Speaker 6
I'm worn.

Speaker 2
Private ones.

Speaker 7
Haji's bone.

Speaker 1
Shut your face!

Speaker 2
Anyway, how's the third child doing? Just take a look. Oh. Wow. I bet knowing this will boost his confidence a little. Can you hear me, Shinji?

Speaker 3
Oh, hi, Misato.

Speaker 2
So how are my

Speaker 3
test scores looking? Great, you're number one.

Speaker 4
Oh, it's not just that I lost. It's that he beat us so easily. He beat us so easily that it's really pissing me off! Oh, he's so great! He's so wonderful! He's so awesome! Shinji, he's our hero, and he used to be a zero! Okay, so that just makes our job a little easier, right? But it also means that the two of us will have to be doing double time just so that we're not left behind!

Speaker 8
I'm leaving. *Gasp

Speaker 5
* *Gasp* *Gasp*

Speaker 2
Next stop is Seisho Kabusei. Seisho Kabusei. Convenient for the Bashar, used books, and video game stores.

Yeah. *Gasp*

*Evacuation*

Speaker 2
Five minutes until the evacuation of the Western District can be completed. The target is advancing slowly at approximately 2.5 km per hour. You're late, Major! Sorry! What's going on? The Fuji observation center's--

Speaker 7
Never detected it. It just suddenly appeared right above us. The pattern is orange. No AT field detected.

Speaker 2
What is that thing? A new kind of angel?

Speaker 7
Unknown. The Magi are withholding their judgment on

Speaker 2
that. Damn! Another situation like this at Command Ikari is not here again! Can you all hear me? I've sent you all of the known target data. That's literally all we know right now. Approach it carefully and observe its reactions. And if possible, try to lure it outside of the city. I want you all to back up each other. Is

Speaker 5
that understood?

Speaker 2
Yes

Speaker 4
ma'am! But don't you think that Shinji ought to be taking the point position? Huh? Well, it's only right that a job like this should go to the highest rated, bravest, number one synchro ratio holder of them all, don't you think? Or could it be that you don't feel up to it, Shinji? I can do it. In fact, I'll show you how

Speaker 3
it ought to be done, Asuka. What was that?

Speaker 2
Will the two of you cut it out?

Speaker 3
Oh, gee, didn't you tell me, Misato, that I was number one?

Speaker 2
Well, yeah, but I...

Speaker 3
And after all, combat's a man's job.

Speaker 4
You're showing a piglet, but Unit 2 will back him off. Unit 0 will back up as well.

Speaker 9
I don't believe these kids. Shinji's hormones are kicking in, aren't they? I'm gonna have to chew him out when he gets back. Of course, you're a model guardian.

Speaker 4
Ayanami, Asuka, are you in your positions yet? Not yet. You know it, Ava can't move that fast, you twit!

Speaker 3
Shice. Are you there? Alright, I'll stop it myself

Speaker 7
It vanished! Status! Pattern blue! Angel confirmed! It's right beneath you and I'm what? What the? A shuttle? What the hell is

Speaker 2
this? This can't be happening! It's Shinji! Get out of there! Shinji! Ikari! You idiot gets her ass again! - Ah! Misato! What's going on? Help me! Misato! Misato! - He jacked that plug! Get him out of there! No response! It's not working! Misato! Misato!

Speaker 4
- Sh, Enji! - Aska Ray! Rescue Unit 1, hurry! - What's the point in only getting A's on Tansy? Not in the real world! It's gone again! Asuka, watch the street! The shadow! Oh no! The whole city is sinking! Asuka! Ray! Pull back!

Speaker 5
Wait!

Speaker 4
Unibun and Shinji are still in there.

Speaker 2
This is an order. Withdraw now.

Speaker 6
Major Katsuragi must feel terrible. They reeled Shinji's umbilical cable back in, but the other end was missing.

Speaker 3
Then,

Speaker 6
without power... There's not much energy left in the internal batteries. If Shinji doesn't waste it groping blindly in the dark, if he stays in the most minimal life support mode, then he can survive for 16 hours.

Speaker 3
The second tank battalion has been deployed. Roger. Hold your current positions and stand by. Confirmed. Condition green. New line transmitting data.

Speaker 4
The UN forces have surrounded the shadow. Movement? It hasn't moved. It stopped spreading once it passed a diameter of 600 meters. Speaking of which, is there a reason for moving all those ground troops in there?

Speaker 2
They're there to help us apply pressure, theoretically. Taking matters into his own hands. Defying

Speaker 4
operations.

Speaker 2
I guess he

Speaker 4
got what he was asking for. Just because he got a little better score than mine, why'd he have to go and try to show me how it ought to be done? Ein gro√üer Dumpkopf, nicht? What? Oh, were my comments about Shinji pissing you off, Wonder Girl?

Speaker 8
I wonder, do you only pilot a Neva for the praise of others? What

Speaker 4
in the hell are you talking about? I don't need to have anybody's approval but my own! Cut it out, you two. Asuka's right. He acted arbitrarily and without consulting anyone.

Speaker 2
So I guess I'll just have to punish him when he comes back.

Speaker 3
I never thought that doing nothing could be this exhausting. Still nothing but white noise.

Speaker 5
No radar

Speaker 3
data or sonar reflections. It's been 12 hours since I switched to life support mode. My life will end in 4 or 5 hours. I'm hungry.

Speaker 2
So that shadow is actually the

Speaker 6
angel's body? Correct. It's 680 meters in diameter with a thickness of 3 nanometers. Sustained within that ultra-thin space is an inverted AT field. Inside of that field is a region of space that can only be defined by abstract mathematics. A sea of Dirac. It could be another universe. What about the sphere? It disappears when the imaginary circuit of the body closes. This implies that the object in the sky is a kind of shadow. So the black shadow that swallowed Unit 1 is the real target. Then there's no way we

Speaker 2
can fight it.

Speaker 3
The water is getting cloudy. The purification system is breaking down. It smells in here. Blood. This lake smells like blood.

Speaker 5
No, I hate

Speaker 3
this place. Let me out. Why can't I open this log? Open up. Let me out. He's not going to tell me what's going on. He's not all. Asuka, I know he needs to go. Father. Father. Please. Someone help me.

Speaker 6
You're gonna blow the shadow up? I'm afraid it's the only possibility that might work. The plan is to drop all 992 existing N2 mines into the target center, while simultaneously activating the AT fields of both remaining Avas in such a way as to disrupt the hypothetical circuit that encloses the Angel's pocket interior. If we concentrate enough explosive power during that same microsecond, we could destroy the Angel along with the Darok-C that makes up its body. But the damage to Ava would be... Shinji wouldn't... What kind of rescue operation is this? Our priority is to get the Eva back, even if it has to be destroyed in the process. Now wait a second! Under these conditions, the pilot's life is irrelevant.

Speaker 7
It's your responsibility if Shinji's lost, Masato! You seem to have forgotten

Speaker 2
that! Then why in the hell are you and Commander Ikari so worried about recovering Unit 1? What's so special about it? You've been

Speaker 6
given all the information, Major! That's a bull. Miss Otto, just trust me. I'm taking command of this entire operation, effective immediately. Forward all flights to Kansai International Airport. Contact air control and the air transport... Second

Speaker 2
impact? The instrumentality

Speaker 6
project,

Speaker 2
Adam.

Speaker 6
There's so many secrets that I'm in the

Speaker 2
dark about.

Speaker 3
Who's that? Who? Who, Shinji Ikari? That's me. I am you. This self incorporates another self. The self has always been composed of two selves. To? Yes, the self which is observed and the

Speaker 5
self

Speaker 3
which observes itself. To expound, there is the Shinji Ikari that exists in your mind, the Shinji Ikari in Misato Katsuragi's mind, the Shinji Ikari in Asuka Soryu's mind, the Shinji Ikari in Rei Ayanami's mind, and the Shinji Ikari in Gendo Ikari's mind. All are different Shinji Ikaris, but each of them is a true Shinji Ikari. What you fear is the Shinji Ikaris who exist in the minds of others. I'm just afraid of being hated. You are afraid of being hurt.

Speaker 4
Who is bad?

Speaker 3
Father is. The father who deserted us.

Speaker 4
No, I'm the one who's bad! There you go again! You're always apologizing! Do you really think it's your fault?!

Speaker 2
I'm worthless. No! You just believe that you're worthless, Shinji. Don't you trust your own father?

Speaker 3
I thought I hated my father, but now I'm not sure.

Speaker 2
That was good work, Shinji.

Speaker 3
My father called me by my name. I was praised by my father! Will you live the rest of your life regurgitating and redigesting those few pleasant memories?

Speaker 1
If I trust

Speaker 3
their words, it's enough. Enough to keep me alive. Even though you know you're deceiving yourself? Everybody does it. That's how everyone survives. If you will not accept that you are capable of initiating change within yourself, you will be unable to continue. This world is filled with too much pain and suffering to keep going on. For example, you can't

Speaker 1
swim. Humans

Speaker 3
aren't made to float. This is self-deception. I don't care what you want to call it. You have been shutting your eyes and covering your ears, making yourself blind and deaf to that which you wish to avoid. His sister was injured during the incident.

Speaker 2
Who cares what the others say?

Speaker 3
Leave. See? You're running away from the reality again.

Speaker 2
No, I don't want to hear this! No one

Speaker 3
can justify their existence by linking their happiest moments into a kind of rosary. In particular, I cannot. I cannot. I cannot.

Speaker 5
What's

Speaker 3
wrong with doing something I want to do? Why won't you

Speaker 6
leave me alone?

Speaker 2
The entry plug energy reserve should be reaching their expiration point about now.

Speaker 6
The plug sits life support system will be getting closer to redline. We'll advance the schedule by 12 minutes. Let's do it while there's a possibility that Shinji's still alive.

Speaker 3
Father, don't you want me?

Speaker 5
Father!

Speaker 4
That's right. He may be guilty of killing his own wife. He killed his own wife?

Speaker 2
No! Mother was... smiling. Shinji, you did something very important today.

Speaker 6
Shinji, you must not run away.

Speaker 2
You've got to do your best.

Speaker 3
I hate this place.

Speaker 5
I hate

Speaker 3
this loneliness. I know. The heat system and the oxygen are giving out. I'm cold The suit is giving out too So cold This is the end So tired of everything

Speaker 5
Mother?

Speaker 3
Is this enough? Well, that's good for you. Both Avas are in

Speaker 5
position and

Speaker 3
standing by.

Speaker 2
AT fields are ready

Speaker 3
to generate.

Speaker 4
Roger. T-minus 60 seconds to mine drop. What the hell is that?

Speaker 7
What's going on? We don't know! All of our meters and gauges are going off the scale! But we haven't done anything yet! You think it could be Shinji? It's impossible! Uni-1's power level must be at zero! Whoa!

Speaker 2
My god! Is that what I'm piloting? God in heaven, what kind of monster have we made this from? I know that the Evas are more than just copies of the first angel. But what is Nerve going to do with them? What is Nerve going to do with the Evas once all the angels have been destroyed?

Speaker 5
*Screaming* Shindy! Shindy!

Speaker 2
Shindy! Shindy! Shindy!

Speaker 1
Are you alright?

Speaker 3
I just wanted to see them one more time.

Speaker 4
Weren't you going to punish him?

Speaker 6
I've never seen the Eva looking as horrifying as it did today. Are the Evas really on our side? Or do they hate us? There's something else. I think that Major Katsuragi may suspect something.

Speaker 2
Let her be, at least for now.

Speaker 6
If Rei or Shinji were to learn about the Eva secrets, they'd never forgive us.

Speaker 8
You can rest today We'll take care of everything But I'm

Speaker 3
I'm feeling just fine now Well, that's good for you

Speaker 2
Huh?

Oh! Oh!

Speaker 3
Ah... It still smells like blood.

Speaker 5
I love you. I love

you.
