1
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
We'll be right back.

2
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,220
Uh, testing. One, two, one, two. You guys hear me? Roger. Calmly gather.

3
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,820
Sorry we couldn't get you the new model in time.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,520
Or a plugsuit that fits my chest.

5
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,280
If I were you, I'd be more concerned with that scrap together prototype of an A.O.

6
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,380
I'm just happy to pilot something. Finally.

7
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,460
You earned it, problem child. Well, good luck.

8
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,080
This is so damn exciting.

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,240
Oh man,

10
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,980
listen to that hump.

11
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,780
Now then, Evangelion

12
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,360
Provisional

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,140
Unit 5,

14
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,040
activate!

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
The Limbo area must be sealed and defended at all costs.

16
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,880
We can't let this thing escape from Acheron.

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,460
How could it possibly have breached a containment

18
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,020
system as secure as coquitus?

19
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,020
Not only was it possible, it was inevitable.

20
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,619
The fact is, mankind is simply not capable of containing the angels on its own.

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,980
We stripped this thing down to the very bone while studying.

22
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,500
And all that really seemed to do was make it angry enough to break through your containment system and your rampaging through your lab.

23
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,640
So then, look.

24
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,760
It's time to face the day.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,700
Time to make it snappy, but you know, first

26
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,080
you

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,280
gotta make it out of bed.

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,920
Hello, Mr. Sunshine, today you're gonna be mine.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,500
Make him pink, he's where there's only grunting styles ahead.

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,100
Take on the day with the one-two punch.

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,980
And there it is. Deploy field.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,260
Target inbound.

33
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,960
Ava unit 5 harry for hostile engagement.

34
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,140
ES power locked

35
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,120
at maximum levels.

36
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,860
God damn it!

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
This thing is stiff!

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Alright, gonna have to do this the hard way!

39
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,780
*Sigh*

40
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,020
What in the hell is Unit 5 doing?

41
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,540
Will you stop?

42
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,480
Get

43
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,260
back here!

44
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,740
Yes! That would really hurt

45
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,500
if this wasn't so much fun!

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
Time's almost stopped!

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,760
Better make this snappy!

48
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,840
The arms were properly safe so this damn thing's starting to fall apart on me!

49
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,500
Fine!

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,140
Here!

51
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,000
You want it down badly, I'll just give you the arms!

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,880
That's enough!

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,120
Just fucking die!

54
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,400
Hey!

55
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,260
Target obliterated. Unit 5 has been vaporized.

56
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,400
Pilot appears to have ejected.

57
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,020
So Unit 5's self-destruct program triggered without so much as a hitch.

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,360
It's all going to plan.

59
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,760
Still, it's a shame we have to use these kids. Grown-ups dirty work.

60
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,980
Oh, that hurt. Sinking with an Ava is even more brutal than they warned me.

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,680
Well, I'm alive, so it's all good.

62
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,720
Still, I do feel kind of bad about using these adults to get what I want.

63
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
Bon voyage, Eva Unit 5.

64
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,540
You served us all well.

65
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,500
How long has it been since we last came here together? Three years?

66
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Yeah. Then the last time for me was when I ran away.

67
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,240
It still doesn't seem real to me that Mom is buried here.

68
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,500
I can't picture her face anymore.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,240
People let their memories fade in order to move on.

70
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Although, there are some things we must never forget.

71
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,380
Your mother taught me how to be grateful for these memories.

72
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,740
And I come here to remind myself how much they matter.

73
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,700
Do you have a picture of her?

74
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,420
They were all destroyed.

75
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,720
Even this grave is empty.

76
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,520
Nothing remains.

77
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,080
So you got rid of everything

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,060
My teacher said you would

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,620
Everything I need is in my heart and mind

80
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
That we'll have to do for now

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,900
It's time

82
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,260
I'm needed elsewhere

83
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,060
Dad, wait!

84
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
I, uh...

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm glad that we got to talk.

86
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,720
Aye.

87
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,260
*Diesling*

88
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,400
You see, Shinji?

89
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,900
I know you were freaked out about it,

90
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,040
but it was a lot easier than you thought it'd be, right?

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
And it was important that the two of you do this together.

92
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,660
I mean, it was a visit to your mom's grave.

93
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,180
I only went because you dragged me out here.

94
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,920
I didn't force you.

95
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,020
You know that deep down you wanted to come.

96
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,320
Be honest with yourself.

97
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,880
If I did that, I'd only end up more miserable.

98
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,600
How can you still be so hard on yourself when you just saved humanity?

99
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,440
You've got to believe in yourself.

100
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,740
I'm sure your dad does, especially after everything you've done.

101
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,000
This is Katsuragi.

102
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,460
Can you repeat that?

103
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,480
Seventh Angel approaching Sagami Bay.

104
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
Second Division engaging target.

105
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,320
A state of emergency has been officially declared.

106
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,960
- I've got a

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
clear vision limit.

108
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,040
I'm bringing in the Unit One pilot right now.

109
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,620
Implement Task Zero Three and prep Unit Zero for launch.

110
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,200
- Negative,

111
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,340
Task Zero Two has been initiated.

112
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,120
- Task Zero

113
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,400
Two?

114
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,400
You mean?

115
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,900
They launched Unit Two!

116
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,580
I'll be right back.

117
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,540
Wow! Just one shot?

118
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
No, that had to be a decoy.

119
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,700
*Screams*

120
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,600
Situation clear.

121
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,920
AVA Unit 2

122
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,100
currently in practice.

123
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,780
Contact 4 may be served.

124
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,060
That's only clear.

125
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
No chance to escalate a time on the fire.

126
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Wow!

127
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,500
It's cool that Unit 2 is red.

128
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,180
That's

129
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,160
not the only thing that's cool about it.

130
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,980
Unit 0 and Unit 1 are basically nothing but beta testing prototypes.

131
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,960
They're antiquated machinery.

132
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,340
But Unit 2 is the final product.

133
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,780
It's the world's very

134
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,340
first true Evangelion.

135
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,040
Perfect in every way.

136
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,040
And there she is, the pride of the Euro Air Force,

137
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,080
Captain Oscar Langley Shikinami.

138
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,780
She's the second child and the designated pilot of Unit 2.

139
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,420
It's been a while, Misato.

140
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,500
So that's the Unit 0 pilot, huh?

141
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,580
The teacher's pet herself.

142
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,820
And one of you must be the daddy's boy

143
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,720
who lucked his way into the Unit 1 cockpit.

144
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,620
Uh, uh...

145
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,360
Hmm.

146
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,560
What are you, stupid?

147
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,500
Were you too busy to help me out?

148
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,940
Not that I needed it.

149
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,860
You would have just gotten in my way.

150
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,300
Aren't you ashamed you were nowhere to be found

151
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,360
during an angel attack?

152
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,540
Were you hiding behind your daddy?

153
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,700
Who the hell does that chick think she is?

154
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,180
Talk about bitchy.

155
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,820
Yeah, but still, you gotta admit,

156
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,980
it's pretty awesome that she's already a captain at our age.

157
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
That's like a ten-year-old going to med school.

158
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,960
Excuse me.

159
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,840
You know if this is the right gate to get to the Geo France hub terminal?

160
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah, this is it.

161
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,180
You've got a transfer at the fourth stop, though.

162
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I've only been gone two years, and I don't recognize a single thing.

163
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,600
Thanks for setting me straight, kid.

164
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,000
Say, though, is Colonel Katsuragi around here?

165
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,580
Uh-huh.

166
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,060
I'm an old friend of hers.

167
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,580
I bet we could swap stories about her snoring keeping us up at night.

168
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,700
Right, Shinji.

169
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,260
He's seen her sleep?

170
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
Who the hell is that guy?

171
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,060
Man, was that job ever a pain in the ass.

172
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,160
Regardless, both AV Unit 5 and the Third Angel were disposed of as planned,

173
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,280
and the cause officially labeled an accident.

174
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,120
The Marduk plan at Bethany Base is all but suspended at this point.

175
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,840
Now then, as for my latest report on sailing

176
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,540
We've already looked over it

177
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,720
The details on the construction of Mark VI are rather helpful

178
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Glad to hear it

179
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,800
Want to look at the item you asked for?

180
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,860
I imagine you must be pretty eager to see it

181
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,240
The metaphysical twining

182
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,420
Between God and the soul

183
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,660
And it will open the door to human instrumentality

184
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
The lost key of Nebuchadnezzar

185
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,200
Then if that's all, I've got some other things I need to attend to.

186
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,820
Chief Inspection Officer Ryoji Kaji.

187
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,620
Are you certain that he can be trusted?

188
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,760
You lost a little weight, eh, Ritsu?

189
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,760
Nice try. But I've gained more than I'd like to admit.

190
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Maybe you're just wearing too many clothes.

191
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,420
I'd show you. But this room is being monitored.

192
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,200
Was monitored. I replaced the main feed with a loop.

193
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,680
Thoroughly prepared, as always, huh?

194
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,860
Hey, when I play, I play to win.

195
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,300
But you've lost.

196
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,780
You should have covered the windows, too.

197
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,180
Well, Rio, it's been a while.

198
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,880
Indeed. Far too long.

199
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,060
What the hell is this jerk doing here?

200
00:14:59,370 --> 00:14:59,980
I thought you got

201
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,860
assigned a euro.

202
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,920
I'm on a job. Looks like I'll be here for a while.

203
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,640
So the three of us can hang out.

204
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,100
It'll be just like old times.

205
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,940
Who the hell wants to try and relive the past?

206
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,140
And I'm down here to see Ritsuko, not you.

207
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,060
HR's just given us the approval on Asuka.

208
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:15,660
Bah!

209
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,220
Oh, my. That was pure jealousy.

210
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,740
I'd say you still have a shot.

211
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Think so? Guess we'll see.

212
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,900
Asuka Langley Shikinami.

213
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,060
It's like she's actually happy to pilot an Ava.

214
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,220
Hey, I'm back.

215
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,140
What happened to my room?

216
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,720
Whose crap is this?

217
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,440
That is not crap.

218
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Those are my belongings.

219
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,640
Huh?

220
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,360
What about my stuff?

221
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,820
Wait, what in the heck are you even doing here?

222
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,300
God, you're an idiot.

223
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,600
It's rather obvious that you've been replaced.

224
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,640
Yeah.

225
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,140
I guess Misato wanted a more skilled pilot as her roommate.

226
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,080
You're joking.

227
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,020
That's what I said when I saw how small these Japanese rooms are.

228
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,820
I mean, I couldn't even fit half my stuff in here.

229
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,980
And is privacy like some completely foreign idea to the Japanese?

230
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,920
Seriously, how do you people live in rooms without locks

231
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,420
when anyone can walk in on you?

232
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,540
- We

233
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,240
don't see the need for them. We

234
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,920
believe in consideration. - Misano...

235
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,280
God, you're irritating.

236
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,720
Now get your junk out of

237
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,240
here so I can unpack. No, no. No one's

238
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,260
kicking Shinji out.

239
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,460
Look, if the two of you are going to work together,

240
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,120
then you need to learn how to communicate.

241
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,080
You two are fellow pilots now,

242
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,720
so you're going to live here together

243
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,120
and learn to act like it.

244
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,060
That's an order, by the way.

245
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,939
Okay, all together now.

246
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,459
Thank you for the meal.

247
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,319
Yeah!

248
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,140
There's nothing better than an ice-cold beer after a nice hot bath.

249
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,500
There's something!

250
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,220
A creature in there!

251
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,819
It's just a penguin.

252
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
His name is Pinpin.

253
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,300
You degenerate pervert!

254
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,060
How dare you spy on me!

255
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,880
It certainly seems like they're starting to get more comfortable with each other.

256
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,040
I've been fed.

257
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,280
You know we're better than they are.

258
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,800
They aren't special the way we are.

259
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,080
Nothing's changed. It's just like before.

260
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,960
You're still better

261
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,700
off on your own, Asuka.

262
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
Yeah.

263
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,140
A field trip?

264
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,760
With Kaji?

265
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,340
Uh-huh.

266
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
And he said I could bring anyone I want.

267
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:06,620
Yeah!

268
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,760
Of course he did.

269
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,260
I'll sit this one out, thanks.

270
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,160
Cool, then I'll just hang out with you.

271
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,980
No, ma'am. You're supposed to be harmonizing.

272
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,960
So you're sticking with Shinji.

273
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,340
Is that another order?

274
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,360
Here we are, not even 100 feet over Topka Moon Base,

275
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,580
and yet they still won't allow us to land.

276
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
Seile can be nasty when they want to.

277
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,440
They're clearly using a new method of construction for the Mach 6.

278
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,560
Just confirming that is enough.

279
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,180
I didn't realize there were any more plans for construction after Unit 5.

280
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,240
For all we know, there could be further undisclosed apocrypha.

281
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,680
Sele is intent to follow the scripture of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

282
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,840
But Sele can't be oblivious to our plans.

283
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,440
They must be aware of Nerveskull by now.

284
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,240
They most likely are, but we can't allow that to alter the course of our path.

285
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Even if that ultimately means acting against the Word of God.

286
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,180
A person? Surely not.

287
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,020
Nice to meet you, Father.

288
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,060
Awesome! This is so damn cool!

289
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,040
It's amazing that a place like this even exists!

290
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,140
I mean, to preserve the remaining marine life and all the research they're doing to restore the ocean to its original state?

291
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,420
And they're actually letting us tour this top-secret facility?

292
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,420
This is the coolest thing any friend has ever done for me!

293
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,640
Thanks for the invitation, ma'am.

294
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,020
Mr. Conchie's the one you should be thanking.

295
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,480
Alright, kids. Gets a little complicated here.

296
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,100
Huh?

297
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:16,720
Oh, what was

298
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,220
Oh!

299
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,620
It's enormous!

300
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,200
That's incredible!

301
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,380
Oh my gosh!

302
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,560
I've never seen anything like this!

303
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,860
So this is what the ocean looked like before the second

304
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,260
impact.

305
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,840
This is crazy!

306
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,580
Have I said this is awesome yet?

307
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:43,940
Whoa!

308
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,160
Check out

309
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,640
that one with the shell on its back!

310
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,460
I think those are called turtles.

311
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,540
They're acting like little children.

312
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,140
What, idiots?

313
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,240
I'm glad you got to come with us, Ray.

314
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,240
So, how are you feeling?

315
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,220
Better.

316
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,740
I finished the treatments, so I'm fine now.

317
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,260
It's cramped in there.

318
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,840
They should turn them loose in one of the bigger tanks.

319
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,140
They can't.

320
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,940
They wouldn't make it outside.

321
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,720
They can only survive in here now.

322
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,080
They're like me that way.

323
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,260
Thanks for the meal.

324
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,740
Oh, this is good.

325
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,660
I'm surprised.

326
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,340
It is.

327
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,700
Hey, you're a pretty good little cook there, Shinji.

328
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,620
It's kind of astounding that 90% artificial meat can taste this good when you grill it right.

329
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah,

330
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,160
Shinji, real hidden talent you got there.

331
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,940
Well, you know, with the way Misato cooks, I had no choice but to learn.

332
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,300
Well, I'll tell you, ladies love a man knows his way around the kitchen.

333
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,100
Do you hear that?

334
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,540
Say

335
00:23:59,540 --> 00:23:59,820
what?

336
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,920
You won't find me doing it. It's no job for a man.

337
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
More like a caveman. Idiot.

338
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,960
What'd you call me? There's nothing wrong with having principles.

339
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,400
Unless there's stupid principles.

340
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,580
Guys, just forget about

341
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,360
it. Eat up.

342
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,660
Oh, sorry, Ray.

343
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,380
Did you not like the food?

344
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,020
Well,

345
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,480
I...

346
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,040
I just don't eat meat.

347
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,100
Why do the Japanese always apologize

348
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,260
when they've done nothing wrong?

349
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,780
And drop the righteousness.

350
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,180
It's perfectly natural to

351
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
eat other living things.

352
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,220
But it'll just be a waste of precious life

353
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,160
if you don't eat that.

354
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,340
What?

355
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,720
You want to fight?

356
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,320
Coming through.

357
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,040
Pardon me.

358
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,380
I'll take care of this situation.

359
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,980
Hey, back off, greedy little bastard!

360
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,960
Forget it! I said no!

361
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,500
What a

362
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,280
moron.

363
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,780
Well, some miso soup, then?

364
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,400
Here, try it.

365
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,200
It's delicious.

366
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,700
It's hard to accept that that's our Mother Earth.

367
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
It breaks my heart to even look at it.

368
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,360
It's even worse knowing there are other human beings who wanted this outcome.

369
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,780
To see the extinction of their own species in order to cleanse the Earth of original sin.

370
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,700
I prefer the living chaos of man instead of this barren wasteland of death.

371
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,080
Chaos is merely a human construct.

372
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,840
The world only knows its own natural law of harmony and order.

373
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,960
So you're saying it's the human heart that throws the world into confusion?

374
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,680
It's kind of hard to wrap my mind around the fact that the ocean was blue before I was born.

375
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,680
I'm still amazed we were able to restore the environment enough for a kid like you to even be born.

376
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't know about this breeze,

377
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,120
though.

378
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,900
Don't you think it smells a little too weird and fishy?

379
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,180
That's just the smell of putrefaction.

380
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,940
It's evidence that there's life here, unlike the red emptiness out there.

381
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,580
This is what the ocean's supposed to smell like.

382
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,040
This world is meant to be brimming with a vast and beautiful diversity of life.

383
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,040
It once was. I wanted you guys to know that.

384
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,720
It really does make me happy.

385
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,740
I just wish Misato would have come with us.

386
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,260
She could never come here.

387
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,120
Too many memories.

388
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,920
Memories of what?

389
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,620
Of living through the second impact.

390
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
Thank you.

391
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,220
- Have you ever asked Misato why she decided to join Nerve?

392
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,840
She doesn't really talk about him, but her father.

393
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,660
He devoted his life to his research,

394
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,040
and she spent a long time hating him for that.

395
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,860
She despised him.

396
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,820
the very thought of him.

397
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,600
Sounds like you and your dad don't get along.

398
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,060
Guess we have that in common.

399
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,120
She's the same as me.

400
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,240
Although, in the end,

401
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,260
her father saved her life.

402
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,340
Surviving something like that,

403
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,760
you go through a lot.

404
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,580
Accepting the loss of those who died,

405
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,420
what they died for,

406
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,380
it's a heavy burden when you're the sole survivor.

407
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,660
Just know,

408
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
we all have our pain.

409
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,100
Target sighted

410
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,480
by Mauna K observatory.

411
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,560
Status, entering Earth's orbit.

412
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,440
I've got a visual coming in from surveillance satellite 3.

413
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,020
Projecting on the main view screen.

414
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,680
It has an AT field strong enough to bend light.

415
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,500
That's unbelievable.

416
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,180
Well, what's its point of impact?

417
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,580
Let me guess.

418
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,040
It's

419
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,660
heading here.

420
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,040
The Magi are calculating.

421
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:32,720
The probability

422
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,740
of a direct hit on NERV is over 99%.

423
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,740
The aerial in tube bombs aren't having any effect.

424
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,760
Then we can't adjust its trajectory.

425
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,540
It's focused its AT field into a single concentrated point.

426
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,360
What's more, it's accumulating energy as it descends.

427
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,240
So from the look of it, the Angel itself is acting as a bomb.

428
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,100
If it scores a direct hit, the results would be catastrophic.

429
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,200
Based on our projections, the blast diameter is 420,000.

430
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,800
Tokyo 3 will be vaporized, along with the Geo Front.

431
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,560
Central Dogma will be completely

432
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,240
exposed.

433
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,320
Where's the commander?

434
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,000
The Angel's field has disrupted all of our ComSat signals.

435
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,920
At present, we're unable to reach him.

436
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,140
Which means we're just going to have to make the call ourselves.

437
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,260
Notify the government, as well as all of the ministries.

438
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,920
Under NERV's authority, we are issuing special declaration D-17.

439
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,580
Evacuate all residents within a 120-kilometer radius.

440
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,220
That's easy enough.

441
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,880
They're one step ahead of us.

442
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,980
Government officials are already running.

443
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,200
Evacuation of all civilians has been completed.

444
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,479
Evacuation of noncombatants and Class D workers

445
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,120
has been completed in accordance with Directive C.

446
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,620
Matsushito Base has agreed to back up the Magi.

447
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,960
So, what's the plan?

448
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,380
Aerial combat's out of the question, since the Evas can't fly.

449
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,040
And there's too much spatial distortion to successfully attempt sniping.

450
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,120
So what other options do we even have against a monster like this?

451
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,420
You can't be serious.

452
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,720
Well, I am.

453
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,340
This is too desperate to even call a plan.

454
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,760
The Magi calculated a failure probability of 99%.

455
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,640
And even if it succeeds, we'd lose three Aebls.

456
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,840
As head of the technology division, I find that unacceptable.

457
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,700
A one percent chance is better than zero.

458
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,260
Be realistic here. It would take a miracle.

459
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,340
We should focus our efforts on protecting Lilith and Unit 1.

460
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:44,820
I am

461
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,460
being realistic. We're gonna create our own miracle.

462
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,040
Colonel Katsuragi!

463
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,500
I am the ranking officer here.

464
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,220
It's my decision.

465
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,660
More than that, it's my job to stop the Angels at all costs.

466
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,120
Your job? You mean your grudge.

467
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,780
You're risking everything for your vendetta.

468
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,780
What? You want us to catch it?

469
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,860
Exactly. As the Angel descends, you'll max out your AT fields and catch it directly.

470
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,580
The target has scrambled its coordinates so we can't accurately calculate its exact point of impact.

471
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,040
In order to narrow the field of possibility, all three Avas will be simultaneously deployed in different locations.

472
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,960
Listen, I can destroy this thing on my own!

473
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,880
No way. It's impossible.

474
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,860
The projected target area is too vast for one Ava to cover.

475
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,880
How do you know where to place us?

476
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,000
Woman's intuition.

477
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,440
Oh, that's reliable.

478
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,620
What's the chance of success?

479
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,860
It's probably best if you don't know that.

480
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,200
Ha! And yet you insist on tethering me to these dead weight.

481
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,420
I've proven that I can take an angel on my own.

482
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,460
The success of this mission is going to require more than your solo combat skills.

483
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,240
So that's how little you think of me, Ben.

484
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,080
That's not it. I need all three of you to make this miracle happen. It's our only shot

485
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,420
I don't understand

486
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:30,760
it,

487
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,160
but

488
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,160
there's something comforting about sitting inside the AVA,

489
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,500
even

490
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,560
at a time like this.

491
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,860
It's familiar somehow.

492
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,820
Is it the smell?

493
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:48,680
It reminds me of my mom and Ray.

494
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,540
There's no turning

495
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,120
back now.

496
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,440
All

497
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,680
right, Avas, get positioned.

498
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,520
We can't rely on the secondary data.

499
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,680
So from here on, all actions will be left to your judgment.

500
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,640
Everything we've got is riding on the three of you.

501
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,160
Target approaching at 20,000 feet.

502
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:15,980
All right,

503
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
release the locks.

504
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,460
Now go!

505
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,520
Target's 18 field is morphing.

506
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,920
It's changing course.

507
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,300
Impact point adjusted to 205.

508
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,320
The target's accelerating.

509
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,100
It's moving faster than they

510
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,560
predicted.

511
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,020
There's no way I'm going to make it in time.

512
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,200
Look, just leave it to me.

513
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,040
Misato!

514
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,300
Raise up the blast shield.

515
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,800
605 to 75.

516
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,200
Next, stagger tips.

517
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:19,120
- 10-7-2 through 10-7-8, downtime!

518
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,880
Target morphing. Distance 12,000.

519
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,760
AT Field at max power!

520
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,480
*Sigh*

521
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm almost there!

522
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,280
I'm the tube, get the cord.

523
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I know that, dammit!

524
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,180
And don't you dare give me orders!

525
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,740
Did I miss?

526
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,560
The dam's been scurrying around!

527
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,560
Thirty seconds left!

528
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,480
Oscar, hurry!

529
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm trying, damn it!

530
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,380
Where'd you go from?

531
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,020
Hurry!

532
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,080
Oscar!

533
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,640
Will you both shut up?

534
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,700
Damn you!

535
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:29,980
Help!

536
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,560
Help!

537
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,600
Now die!

538
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,260
Kill!

539
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,420
*Sigh

540
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,820
*

541
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,720
Thank you.

542
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,320
The system's back up. Incoming call from Commander Akari.

543
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,540
Patch him through.

544
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,120
My apologies, Commander.

545
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,860
Because of decisions I made, we sustained heavy damage.

546
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,180
Not only to the Avas, but the pilots as well.

547
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,900
The responsibility's mine, and mine alone, Commander.

548
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,260
It's okay. In light of the danger this target imposed,

549
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,700
this level of damage could be considered fortunate.

550
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,160
I agree. You did well, Colonel Katsaraki.

551
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,440
Thank you, sir.

552
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,060
Patch me through to Unit 1's pilot.

553
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,020
I heard what happened. You did very well, Shinji.

554
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,600
Oh, uh, thank you, sir.

555
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,820
I'll leave the recovery effort to you, Colonel Katsuraki.

556
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,640
Yes,

557
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,880
sir. Expedite recovery of the Avas.

558
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,760
Emergency transport priority goes to Unit 1.

559
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,920
I couldn't do anything. I was helpless on my own.

560
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,540
I've never not been alone.

561
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,700
It's all I know.

562
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
So why do I feel like this?

563
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,740
Just turn back around.

564
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,140
Will you let me just lie here for a while?

565
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,640
Hey, um, Asuka?

566
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,500
You know, you really should refer to me as Captain.

567
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,140
I guess you can call me Asuka, though.

568
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,260
but only if I get to call you stupid Shinji.

569
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,420
Oh, well, Asuka, why do you pilot the Eva?

570
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,520
Stupid question. I clearly picked the right name for you.

571
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,460
I pilot the Eva because I want to.

572
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,700
Why do you do it?

573
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,320
I'm not really sure why.

574
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,540
Don't be an idiot.

575
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,940
You just don't want

576
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,240
to admit the reason to yourself.

577
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,320
I think I do it for my father's approval.

578
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,500
Today, he actually praised me.

579
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,560
I've always hated being praised, but I didn't today.

580
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,900
And I wonder if he's proud of me now.

581
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,320
Maybe it's just like Misato was saying.

582
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,760
Stupid

583
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,340
Shinji. You really

584
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,040
are an idiot.

585
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,520
Thank you, God, for inventing lunch!

586
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,560
It's the only good thing about school there is!

587
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,160
What?

588
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,140
Why didn't you make lunch for us?

589
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,420
Because I didn't have time to. I was doing my homework all morning.

590
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,080
Well, that's just great! You got your stupid homework done,

591
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,000
and now I get a star for that day, you idiot!

592
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,860
I already promised to make it tomorrow.

593
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
Look at this. The newlyweds are fighting.

594
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,420
Shut up!

595
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,840
-

596
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,800
Could I maybe join you? You mind?

597
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,700
I guess, but I don't have enough to share.

598
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,620
Here, Ray.

599
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,540
It's for you. You never have lunch, so I thought...

600
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,900
Yes, thank you.

601
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,140
I'm so glad I

602
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,660
finally worked

603
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,960
out and we have to talk to you.

604
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,280
That's your name?

605
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,380
Well, you can eat the rest.

606
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,720
Oh, man, am I stuffed.

607
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,880
Thank you for this

608
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,180
meal.

609
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,420
Kind of a late lunch, huh?

610
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,760
Yeah, I was busy.

611
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,340
So I heard you leave the cooking up to Shinji.

612
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,360
That's good.

613
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,760
Glad you're not just eating instant ramen.

614
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,840
Yeah, I guess.

615
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,900
Unlike you, some people actually have work to do

616
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,500
and don't have time to waste on cooking.

617
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,540
Serious as ever about your work.

618
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,640
And that's great.

619
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,620
I mean, it's a strength.

620
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,120
Most of the time, at least.

621
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,520
I heard about the little spat you had with Ritzi the other day.

622
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,220
It wouldn't hurt you to try to relax a little.

623
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,860
That'd be nice, but I've got too much on my plate to relax.

624
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,860
Sad but true.

625
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,820
You're never gonna find a guy with that kind of tension in your life.

626
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,820
And why the hell do you care?

627
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,300
- I'm gonna move

628
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,760
All rise! Bow! Be seated.

629
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,600
Hmm. It appears Miss Ayanami is absent again. Oh well.

630
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,560
I wonder why. She seemed fine yesterday.

631
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,120
They're like me that way. They

632
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,620
can only survive in there.

633
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,340
Ray.

634
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,140
It's time for a meal.

635
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,840
Yes.

636
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Commander Ikari?

637
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,560
Yes, Ray.

638
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,440
Do you find meals enjoyable?

639
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:36,720
Yes.

640
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,640
And do you find pleasure in eating with others?

641
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:43,500
Yes.

642
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,180
And the act of cooking, that's enjoyable, isn't it?

643
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,120
Yes.

644
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,840
Commander Ikari, would it be nice to sit down for a meal with your son and the others

645
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,180
sometime?

646
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,620
No, I don't have time.

647
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,960
Gendo, take care of Shinji.

648
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,940
All right, then. Count me in.

649
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,620
This

650
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,420
sucks! Talk about boring!

651
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,020
I'd rather be fighting an angel right now. I hate these checks.

652
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:47,000
Well, this is part of the job, and we want to build a peaceful world without the threat of angel attacks, hoping for one is counterproductive.

653
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:47,720
Yep.

654
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,560
Endless tedium.

655
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,500
Can you even begin to imagine that?

656
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Just one quiet, boring day after another?

657
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,620
I don't know.

658
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,020
Sounds pretty nice to me.

659
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,880
Check's complete.

660
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,740
All signals are loud and clear.

661
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:01,880
Good work,

662
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,320
you three.

663
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,400
We're done now.

664
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,420
You can come on out.

665
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,820
to analysis and diagnostic circuit

666
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,900
803.

667
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,280
Back up to 5.

668
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Comence a Calcio Padre in three minutes.

669
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,780
I hope I'm not out of line here,

670
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,320
but repairing this damage is going to put operations at a standstill.

671
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,020
Couldn't we just ignore the Vatican Treaty?

672
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:23,900
I wish we could.

673
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,380
They didn't seem to take repairs into account

674
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,540
when they prohibited each country from owning more than three avas.

675
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,360
As of right now, all of our repair work is focused on Unit 1,

676
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,080
And we're pretty much tapping out our spare parts surplus,

677
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,200
so we don't even know when we'll be able to repair Unit Zero.

678
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,100
The ego of every country is wrapped up in that treaty. It'd be impossible to get it revised.

679
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,280
And to make matters worse for us, Russia and Euro are alleging that Asia had something to do with the loss of Unit 5.

680
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,080
Things get ugly when politics are involved.

681
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:53,720
We

682
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,000
have to wade through a sea of red tape before we can protect the world.

683
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,100
*Sigh*

684
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,800
Dammit, where are my glasses?

685
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:30,200
Um.

686
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,500
Oh, sorry about that.

687
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,420
Are you okay?

688
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Yeah, this is Mari.

689
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,460
Yeah, the wind picked up and took me off target.

690
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,240
It looks like I landed on a school of some sort.

691
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,200
What?

692
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,380
Well, you were the one who told me to enter Japan covertly.

693
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,200
That's not my problem.

694
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,400
That's for you and the Euro people to work out.

695
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,480
Just make sure you're there for my extraction, okay?

696
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,420
Thanks.

697
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,540
You smell good, like LCL.

698
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,880
One of my favorite smells in the world.

699
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,080
Your smell.

700
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,500
I said I like it.

701
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,240
But let's pretend that I wasn't here.

702
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,660
That cool with you, Nerfling?

703
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,220
What? That's weird.

704
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,220
Hey, lonely? We could take you out on a date.

705
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,900
You realize I'm a guy, right?

706
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,620
Do I look like I care?

707
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:48,820
Gender

708
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,480
has got nothing to do with love.

709
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,000
Just messing with you.

710
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,480
Thirsty?

711
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,920
It smells fresh.

712
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,080
Like life.

713
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,520
Don't tell me you're already worn out.

714
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,000
I paid for more labor than that.

715
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,520
You didn't pay me.

716
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,640
You mean that can of coffee?

717
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,340
So that's what you were up to.

718
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,300
Somehow I didn't really expect you to be the devious type.

719
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,500
Why the heck not?

720
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,840
Do you know any adults who aren't devious?

721
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,680
These plants here, are they watermelons?

722
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:42,280
Yep.

723
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:43,440
Cute, huh?

724
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They're kind of my hobby.

725
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,340
I love growing things.

726
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,600
It gives you a greater perspective on the world.

727
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,120
Gives you the chance to sort things out.

728
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,700
Reminds you what it is to enjoy life.

729
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,100
So it helps you forget the pain.

730
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,500
Not a big fan of pain, huh?

731
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,660
Well, I don't like it.

732
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,400
Is there anything that you do like?

733
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,420
Hey, that's all right.

734
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,160
Listen, the way I see it, it's the people who've lived through true pain that understand the value of kindness.

735
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,480
If anything, it makes them stronger.

736
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,680
But tell me this.

737
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,060
You like Misato?

738
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,260
Do I like her?

739
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,820
Well, I don't not like her.

740
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,620
Do me a favor.

741
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,080
Protect her.

742
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,720
She needs it.

743
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,300
And I can't do it.

744
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,200
You're the only one who can.

745
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:39,940
Please.

746
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,460
*Bell rings*

747
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,320
Good morning.

748
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,360
Ray,

749
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,020
you're back!

750
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,840
Good morning.

751
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,400
That's, uh, not like her.

752
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,520
Hey, Ray, are you all right?

753
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,840
Yes, I'm feeling fine.

754
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,720
What's wrong with your hand?

755
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:28,840
Oh, this?

756
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,000
Dr. Akagi put these on for me.

757
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,820
Well, what happened?

758
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:33,980
Nothing.

759
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,400
It's a secret, but I'll tell you later.

760
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,280
Ray seems different lately.

761
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,180
I've noticed.

762
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,900
The idea of her doing something for someone else is a little startling.

763
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,700
I wonder what brought this on.

764
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,500
Well, it could be love.

765
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,080
Ray

766
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,520
and love?

767
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:01,660
You're joking,

768
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:01,960
right?

769
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,060
Hmm.

770
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,940
Now I'm handsy like stupid Shinji is probably gonna be as stupid spicy.

771
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,420
Hey, I'm back!

772
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,540
Oh, Misato, you're home early.

773
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,020
Yeah, but I'm going straight back to work.

774
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,880
I just dropped in to take a bath.

775
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:22,700
Whoa!

776
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,520
So, what's all this about?

777
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,440
If I had to guess, I think you'd be cooking for Shinji.

778
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,120
What?

779
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,140
No, I'm not. It's just for, um, my friend Ikari.

780
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,520
First Rei and now you, too?

781
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,060
You're both so romantic.

782
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,980
Excuse me.

783
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,720
Don't let me in with Wonder Girl.

784
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:40,820
You're right.

785
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,580
After all, she's taking things to a whole different level.

786
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,060
What? How so?

787
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,900
Well, I get the feeling that she's trying to force a bond

788
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,680
between Shinji and Commander Ikari.

789
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:50,300
Here.

790
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,180
She's invited everyone to a dinner party,

791
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,000
and she's going to serve a home-cooked meal.

792
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,060
It's a pretty direct plan of attack.

793
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,840
Bringing those two together

794
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,140
is gonna be just about as easy as moving mountains.

795
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,280
She's doing all this, but that stupid Shinji?

796
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,280
It's supposed to be a surprise, so don't tell him anything, okay?

797
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,580
Oh, like I even care enough!

798
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,700
So stupid.

799
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,800
All of our auxiliary systems, we need help on standby.

800
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,080
Hey, it's fine.

801
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,580
Vaporized?

802
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,320
AVA Unit 4 and Branch 2 were wiped off the map?

803
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,740
This is the analysis of Ground

804
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,080
Zero at T-plus-10.

805
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,920
It's terrible.

806
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,660
The satellite data feed verifies that the AT field collapsed,

807
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,160
but we're still not sure why.

808
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,040
So Unit 4 was at the center.

809
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,840
And our Avas? Tell me they're stable.

810
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,460
Well, Unit 4...

811
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,900
We can talk about it.

812
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,980
It was being used as

813
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,140
a test subject for

814
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,240
a new internal engine.

815
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,740
That's all we know.

816
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,580
It's not much.

817
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,020
North America has been pretty tight-lipped.

818
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,840
They wouldn't even disclose their intel to Dr. Akagi.

819
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:12,920
Well,

820
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:13,840
then who would know?

821
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,620
So, Unit 4.

822
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,900
It was an experimental unit

823
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,120
meant to usher in the next generation of Avas.

824
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,460
Anything could have gone wrong with it.

825
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,160
Although...

826
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,800
Was it really an accident?

827
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,460
*Mirror sounds*

828
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,760
Hey, excuse me.

829
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:01,980
Give me three, please.

830
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,640
What's with the generosity?

831
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,880
It's not really like you.

832
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,680
Oh, yeah? Maybe you just don't hang out with us enough to see my generous side.

833
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,440
Ever think of that?

834
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,080
No, this is definitely a first. Why don't you just tell him that your sister is feeling better?

835
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,860
Shut up!

836
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,240
No one was talking to you, moron!

837
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,560
So, Shinji.

838
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,340
Hmm?

839
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,480
I heard they're shipping unit 3 to Japan.

840
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,540
They are?

841
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,220
That's the first I've heard of it.

842
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,420
Well, these are just rumors.

843
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,000
But I heard the US insisted we take it.

844
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,360
But I guess you pilots don't really need to know this stuff.

845
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,860
Hey, who do you think will

846
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,400
pilot it?

847
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,820
How would I know?

848
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,120
They keep me in the dark.

849
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,980
It must be so cool to be a pilot.

850
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,460
You think they'd ever pick me?

851
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,360
Why are you asking me?

852
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,660
Talk to Misato.

853
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,940
Things never last.

854
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:10,420
So, two units have been lost in a matter of months.

855
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,240
Yes. First Unit

856
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,600
5 and now Unit 4.

857
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,580
In terms of progress, their loss is a hindrance to our plans, but still.

858
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,860
A setback perhaps, but it doesn't pose any real problem.

859
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:29,160
The American government has insisted that you accept their offering of Unit 3, and your government has already agreed to take it.

860
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,380
It's state-of-the-art and should suffice as your primary unit.

861
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,260
The elimination of the Angels requires a more reliable approach.

862
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,680
An untested unit can't be trusted.

863
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:43,160
But if you would simply approve the additional budget to repair Unit 0...

864
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,120
The prototype's function has grown obsolete.

865
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,920
You're no longer needed.

866
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,140
There are other matters that are far more deserving of our concerns.

867
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,620
Our only desire is the true Evangelion.

868
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,900
Its awakening will coincide with the resurrection of Lilith and usher in the time of the Covenant.

869
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,920
It's crucial that the necessary rites be performed by them, for the sake

870
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,940
of the human instrumentality project.

871
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,540
I am aware of this. I assure you that all will go according to Sele's plan.

872
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,200
The true Evangelion.

873
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:24,260
They see all of our current Avas, including Unit 1, as simple placeholders to precede its completion.

874
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,380
So that's the purpose of the Mark VI?

875
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,800
They're taking it one step further.

876
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,160
They've decided to create a real god instead of false ones.

877
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:36,500
Yes, we must hasten the awakening of Unit 1.

878
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,940
What the hell? You can't put Unit 2 into containment!

879
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,500
You know the stipulations of the Vatican Treaty.

880
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,380
With the arrival of Unit 3, we have no choice.

881
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:51,940
In store

882
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,080
Unit Zero! It's

883
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,900
not even functioning!

884
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,220
We would if we could.

885
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,780
But Uro still technically owns Unit 2.

886
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,780
We have to keep our infos operational.

887
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,060
It's in a political gray area right now.

888
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,400
Uro hasn't even said if they want you to continue piloting it.

889
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,840
But it's mine! No one else can pilot it!

890
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,540
It's a combat weapon, Oscar.

891
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:14,860
We have a backup plan for everything, and that includes the pilot.

892
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,620
I repeat, Ava Unit

893
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,940
2 is being submerged.

894
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,140
The cockpit of Ava is the only place I feel like I belong.

895
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,340
The Ava's only mirror what's in our hearts.

896
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,280
What did you say?

897
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,180
You don't have to depend on the Ava.

898
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,080
There's plenty of happiness for you in the world outside.

899
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,140
How would you know anything about it?

900
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,200
Don't patronize me.

901
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,920
I actually worked to be a pilot.

902
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,300
I was selected purely because of my skills.

903
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,880
I didn't get in through nepotism

904
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,760
like you did.

905
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,960
I can't help it that I'm tied to it.

906
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,400
The only human connections I have are through the Ava.

907
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,520
Shut up!

908
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,060
You're only the commander's favorite because you're a suck-up.

909
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,800
His obedient little doll that does every single thing he says.

910
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,520
I am not a doll.

911
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,380
Yes, you are! How could you be so damn

912
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,180
oblivious?

913
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,980
You've got some nerve for a doll.

914
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,380
I've got a question for you.

915
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,260
What do you really think of the idiot?

916
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:49,680
Idiot?

917
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,900
Yeah, the idiot, stupid Shinji.

918
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,360
What do I think?

919
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,040
Let's hear it.

920
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,520
I, um, I'm not sure.

921
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,580
You Japanese are so reserved.

922
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,080
Just

923
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,460
say how you feel, damn it!

924
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,460
I don't know.

925
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,660
Although, being with him makes me feel warm inside.

926
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,140
And I, I want him to feel the same way.

927
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,780
I want him to get along with his father.

928
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,680
And to feel warm inside, that's all.

929
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,660
Is that so?

930
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,460
She's just as much of a stupid idiot as he is.

931
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,580
She doesn't even realize that she likes him.

932
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,440
I can't wait for this dinner party.

933
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,380
I am a little nervous about Ray's cooking, though.

934
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,340
I just wish that Dad would come.

935
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,680
So

936
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,680
there it is,

937
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,120
the dummy system.

938
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,920
It's supposed to be a support system for the pilot,

939
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,100
but it can pilot the AVA on its own.

940
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,240
It can even generate an AT field without a pilot.

941
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,740
It does seem more humane than putting children in the cockpit.

942
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,960
So this new dummy system they're instating.

943
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,720
I don't trust that thing at all.

944
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,360
It's a top-secret development from Golgotha base.

945
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,520
It's a mystery to all of us.

946
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,040
And we're gonna let it pilot our giant mechanized weapons for us?

947
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:27,800
It's insane!

948
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,020
So you're saying you're more comfortable with human pilots?

949
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:31,880
Is that it?

950
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,760
I know you trust Shinji and all,

951
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,520
but is that the only reason you feel that way?

952
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,520
Forget it.

953
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,380
What about this organization called Seilei or whatever?

954
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,780
What do you know about it?

955
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,800
I'd advise against sticking your nose into that one.

956
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,120
That's not an option.

957
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,300
Human instrumentality.

958
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,100
What is Nerve really up to behind the scenes?

959
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,120
Honestly.

960
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,520
I'd like to know that one myself.

961
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,340
This is the first meal we've had in years.

962
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,560
All we do is talk about work.

963
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,980
Things have changed since we were students.

964
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,560
We're aware of so much more.

965
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,420
So many more burdens.

966
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,780
I guess we don't have the luxury of just thinking of ourselves anymore.

967
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,800
Shinji and the others.

968
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,760
Now, those kids have the greatest burden of them all.

969
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:24,660
Yeah.

970
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,000
They shouldn't have to deal with the shit we put them through.

971
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,160
But we don't have any other choice.

972
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,340
Yes?

973
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:39,860
Yeah, right, I know.

974
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,620
I'll have my decision for you by midnight.

975
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,300
That Ritzi?

976
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:45,840
Yep.

977
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,800
She's harassing me about the unit three test pilot.

978
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:51,000
It is your responsibility to choose.

979
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,620
Yeah, I know it is

980
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,020
It's just that out of all the days that unit three could arrive

981
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,540
They had to pick the worst one possible so

982
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:03,020
that's when they're running a unit three activation tests

983
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,300
The same day as the suck-ups dinner party

984
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,840
Really? You've settled on Oscar?

985
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,860
Right. I'm heading to Matsushiro on the last flight out.

986
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,280
I'll leave the rest in your hands, Maya.

987
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,460
Yes, ma'am. Have a good flight.

988
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,480
Um,

989
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,840
Dr. Akagi?

990
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:47,960
Huh?

991
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,600
I have a message for the second child.

992
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:53,720
Could I call her?

993
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,920
You have one unheard message.

994
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:08,820
First

995
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:09,860
unheard message.

996
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,820
Here you go, Ray. You can talk now.

997
01:04:27,099 --> 01:04:28,060
Thank you.

998
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,400
Huh, God, she's an idiot.

999
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,960
I'm doing this to pilot Eva, not for her.

1000
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,020
If I decide that I like Unit 3, have them repaint it red, okay?

1001
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,700
Morning, Kensuke.

1002
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,260
Morning.

1003
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,600
Morning, Shinji.

1004
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,440
Oh, hey, where's Tochi?

1005
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,980
Oh, he's at the hospital.

1006
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,180
From what I heard, his sister's getting out today.

1007
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:57,980
Oh,

1008
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,340
right. That's great.

1009
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,220
He told me to tell you this.

1010
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,980
Forget about the whole thing.

1011
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,860
And his sister says thanks, too.

1012
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,220
So no more guilt.

1013
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,940
You know, things are starting to look up.

1014
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,900
So then, it's your big night.

1015
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,460
Your special evening with Ray.

1016
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,580
You fucking bastard, you!

1017
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:34,960
Mission Director, the man activation testing of engineering unit 3 has arrived on the premises and is currently on the

1018
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,840
Test pilot medical checkup

1019
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,320
completed.

1020
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,740
Currently standing by in local quarantine.

1021
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,140
It looks like we've got everything in order per week's go.

1022
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:09,560
A

1023
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,660
secure line from Asuka?

1024
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:12,500
Fine,

1025
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,160
that's fine.

1026
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,140
Let's get a diagnostic camera set up on this.

1027
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,980
What's up, Asuka? You need a pep talk?

1028
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,200
I just suddenly felt like talking to you for some reason.

1029
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:22,340
Sure.

1030
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,660
And like I said, I appreciate you doing this.

1031
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,100
Thanks again.

1032
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,540
No need for thanks.

1033
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:36,400
It's the duty of the elite to protect the ignorant masses.

1034
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,260
I'm not really big on dinner parties anyway.

1035
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,600
And it's exhausting to act like you're having fun, but you're not.

1036
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,660
Who wants to sit around watching everyone else have fun?

1037
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,220
The only thing I care about is being a pilot.

1038
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,920
And I actually like being alone.

1039
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,460
I don't really have much use for phony friends.

1040
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,240
I mean, no one's ever seen me for the real me.

1041
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,920
And my performance scores are more important.

1042
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,460
I'd rather cement my status and nerve.

1043
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,880
I was kind of starting to think that I didn't mind being around other people so much.

1044
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,940
But that is just so not me.

1045
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:11,380
I don't think

1046
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,080
that's true.

1047
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,260
You have a kind heart, Asuka.

1048
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,620
I've never talked to anyone like this before.

1049
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,220
I actually feel better now.

1050
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,760
It feels kind of nice to talk to someone.

1051
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,400
I had no idea.

1052
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,460
Well, believe it or not, the world is full of all sorts of great things you don't know about yet.

1053
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,060
Try to enjoy it.

1054
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,780
You're right. And I will thank you.

1055
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,900
One last thing. It's cool that it's retinol, but what pervert designed this suit?

1056
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:44,700
It's a bit

1057
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,300
revealing.

1058
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,420
Begin entry sequence.

1059
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,140
LCL ionization. Pressure level status 3.

1060
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:50,320
All

1061
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,840
test levels 3. High-resolver.

1062
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,460
I

1063
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:04,580
can laugh. I didn't know I could.

1064
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,540
Blood depth over 100.

1065
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,620
Contamination levels are in the red zone.

1066
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,740
What's happening?

1067
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,440
Highlights

1068
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:26,859
descending

1069
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:27,859
below safe depths.

1070
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,880
Pull back. If this keeps progressing,

1071
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,240
she'll no longer be human.

1072
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,060
Abort attack. Shut it down.

1073
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,960
Ladies, high energy readings are in the neighbor.

1074
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:37,759
An angel?

1075
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:39,680
No!

1076
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:47,380
What?

1077
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,319
An explosion of Matsushito?

1078
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:04,779
What's the damage?

1079
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,279
Unit 3 holding cage appears to be the epicenter.

1080
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,580
Destruction of above-ground facilities confirmed.

1081
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,980
Immediately dispatch all rescue units.

1082
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:12,759
I want this

1083
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:15,080
resolved before the SSDF steps in.

1084
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:15,620
Yes, sir.

1085
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:16,740
We've got a new alert, sir.

1086
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,520
Unidentified object sighted.

1087
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:19,600
The pattern's orange.

1088
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,380
We can't tell if it's an angel.

1089
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,020
- Battle stations, condition one.

1090
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:24,839
- Sir?

1091
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,279
- Issue a base-wide condition one alert.

1092
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,799
Place unit zero on standby.

1093
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,680
Ready unit one for launch

1094
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,680
as soon as it's been fitted with a dummy plug.

1095
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,960
- Deployment of the fifth tank company

1096
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,480
to defensive line 18 complete.

1097
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,560
- Connection of main power extension cable

1098
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,520
scheduled for completion in two minutes.

1099
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,080
Back at mobile strike unit is

1100
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,680
in unit one.

1101
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,100
Are Asuka and Misato okay?

1102
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,160
We're making every effort we can to rescue them.

1103
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,319
Try not to worry.

1104
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,900
But without Misato or any backup,

1105
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,700
then there's just no way I can do this on my own.

1106
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,340
We're still fully staffed down here,

1107
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,240
and Commander Ikari's directing this operation personally.

1108
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:05,740
My

1109
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,220
dad is?

1110
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,160
We

1111
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,460
have footage from outside Tome.

1112
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,040
I'm patching it through now.

1113
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:21,160
Just as we feared transmit the shutdown signal force eject the second child's entry plug

1114
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:29,120
We've confirmed

1115
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,280
that there's a core like substance

1116
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:30,900
around the entry

1117
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,900
plug pattern

1118
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,600
analysis complete it's

1119
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:33,800
blue

1120
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:41,580
As of this moment, we're officially discarding Evangelion unit 3 target will now be identified as the ninth angel

1121
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,100
- Target approaching.

1122
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,640
Prepare to intercept ground to ground.

1123
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,800
- Blockade units, open fire!

1124
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,240
- All blockade units retreat to

1125
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:50,440
the end of the defense.

1126
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:50,880
- Is that a...

1127
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,400
Are you sure that's an Angel?

1128
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,180
- 100%. That's your target.

1129
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,660
- That's my target?

1130
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,140
But it can't be.

1131
01:10:59,340 --> 01:10:59,840
That's an Ava.

1132
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,000
- Open fire!

1133
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:03,920
- This is wrong.

1134
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,100
- Your target is now approaching.

1135
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,600
It must be destroyed.

1136
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,419
- But that...

1137
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,660
This doesn't feel right.

1138
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,640
Oscar was supposed to be piloting it.

1139
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,520
Is she in there?

1140
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,720
*Sigh

1141
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,640
*

1142
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:14,540
I don't know.

1143
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,760
- Armor corroding your cervical vertebrae.

1144
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,560
- Surface layer's contaminated and it's spreading.

1145
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,080
- It's attacking invasively.

1146
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,380
This could be tricky.

1147
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,600
- Unit 1's 18th is unstable.

1148
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,540
- Life support's malfunctioning.

1149
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,840
The pilot is in severe danger.

1150
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:42,620
- Damn,

1151
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,460
minimize the neural connections to 28%.

1152
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,300
- Not yet.

1153
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,200
- We have to.

1154
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,160
The pilot will die at this rate.

1155
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,500
- Shinji, why aren't you fighting?

1156
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,620
- Because of the force.

1157
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:53,640
- I'm not sure.

1158
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,140
I'm still in there!

1159
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:54,580
I

1160
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,640
can't!

1161
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,000
Listen.

1162
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,740
That is an angel.

1163
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,300
And that is all that matters.

1164
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,000
No!

1165
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,340
You can't do it!

1166
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,880
You can't make me murder, Asuka!

1167
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,420
Then you're going to die.

1168
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:06,280
Fine!

1169
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,760
I'd rather die than kill her!

1170
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:09,960
No matter.

1171
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,080
Sever the pilot's synchronization with Unit 1 now.

1172
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:13,740
Commander!

1173
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:14,780
Cut it entirely?

1174
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:15,280
Correct.

1175
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,560
Switch all control to the dummy system.

1176
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,020
But, sir, we would need Dr. Akagi's instructions.

1177
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,320
And the system, it's not ready.

1178
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,800
It will be of more use than the current pilot.

1179
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,100
Now do it.

1180
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,040
Yes, sir.

1181
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:50,960
What is this?

1182
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:52,940
What's going on?

1183
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,660
What the hell are you doing, Dad?

1184
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,580
System switchover successfully completed.

1185
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:05,840
Energy

1186
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,440
detection

1187
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,280
efficiencies...

1188
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:07,500
AT

1189
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,540
field stable. Recover to level B.

1190
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,220
Connection. Central nerves confirmed.

1191
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,620
No abnormalities detected.

1192
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,960
Very good. Release the system.

1193
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,020
Commence attack.

1194
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,360
*Ding*

1195
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,240
My god, it's stronger than you expected.

1196
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,240
Dummy systems functioning normally.

1197
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,460
Control limiters

1198
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,000
being released.

1199
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:24,180
*sad music*

1200
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:52,980
*sad music*

1201
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:54,860
What?

1202
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,120
What?

1203
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:02,820
What's going on, Dad?

1204
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,500
What is this?

1205
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,520
What are you doing!

1206
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,200
Dammit!

1207
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:11,540
Please

1208
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,080
stop,

1209
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,080
stop, stop, stop, stop...

1210
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,880
Stop, stop, stop, stop...

1211
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:24,860
What's that sound?

1212
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,080
Stop it!

1213
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:31,900
Jump!

1214
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,960
- Two survivors confirmed to shout six.

1215
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,260
- I'm alive.

1216
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:14,880
Kashiya.

1217
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:16,660
- You're lucky, damn

1218
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,060
lucky.

1219
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,200
- Is Fritsko?

1220
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,180
- Don't worry, she's just a little bruised.

1221
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:24,880
- Good.

1222
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,360
- Asuka, what happened to her?

1223
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,080
She... Unit 3 was destroyed.

1224
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:33,540
As an angel.

1225
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:45,680
We've

1226
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,580
cut Unit 1 synchronization circuits.

1227
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,320
What about the ejection signal?

1228
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,660
It's being overridden from within the plug.

1229
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:51,920
He's

1230
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,140
locked himself inside me.

1231
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,540
Listen to reasons, Shinji.

1232
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,840
Just stop and think about what you're doing. Please!

1233
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,440
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1234
01:17:59,060 --> 01:17:59,940
And you're only making me

1235
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,320
angrier.

1236
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,440
Unit 1 has 285 seconds left.

1237
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,180
That's enough time to destroy

1238
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:05,480
half

1239
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,740
of headquarters if I want.

1240
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,060
In his state of mind, he might just do it.

1241
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,320
Shinji, please just listen to us!

1242
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,420
Commander Ikari had to do it!

1243
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:15,740
You would have died if he didn't make that call!

1244
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,060
That

1245
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,180
doesn't change anything.

1246
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,160
But it's still the truth, dammit!

1247
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,680
I would have rather died than be a part of what you've done!

1248
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,540
Dead trite!

1249
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
That bastard tried to kill Asuka!

1250
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,960
Can you use my hands to do it?

1251
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,060
Tell me why?

1252
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:32,440
Why?

1253
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,280
Why did you do it?

1254
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,520
You don't even understand,

1255
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,260
do you, Dad?

1256
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,460
I was so stupid to trust you.

1257
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,380
Maybe if you lose something you

1258
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,000
care about,

1259
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,360
then you'll understand!

1260
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,320
Raise the LCL compression density to the limit.

1261
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,560
We don't

1262
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,660
have time to deal with a child's tantrum.

1263
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,580
I've got control of the circuits!

1264
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:53,880
*Gunshot*

1265
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:55,220
*Gunshot*

1266
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,540
Damn you! Damn you!

1267
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:00,800
Damn

1268
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,340
you!

1269
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,720
You're always listening to that, aren't you?

1270
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:24,640
Yeah.

1271
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,480
This used to be my dad's old cassette player.

1272
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,020
Just like his old glasses you've

1273
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:30,400
got, Ray.

1274
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,780
He didn't need it anymore, so he got rid of it.

1275
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,260
Just like me.

1276
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,920
I found it at my old teacher's place, and I took it.

1277
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,480
I close up my ears to close off my heart,

1278
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:44,080
so I can drown out the noise of this cruel world.

1279
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,900
This cruel world?

1280
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,000
That's right.

1281
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,480
The world where the father I hate lives.

1282
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:56,520
the world of angels and avas where i'm forced to do terrible things where my father can replace me

1283
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:03,200
with a dummy and my friends get hurt i know that good things happen too but none of it ever seems

1284
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:10,280
to last y'all gets destroyed in the end it's a cruel world and i'm turning my back on it

1285
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:15,280
i thought if i became a pilot my dad would protect me from all this

1286
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,140
I was stupid enough to believe that.

1287
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,900
Did you ever really try to understand your father?

1288
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,660
Of course I did.

1289
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,680
Are you sure about that?

1290
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,000
Look, I tried, dammit!

1291
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,020
He's the one

1292
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,640
that's wrong!

1293
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,800
He's the one who abandoned me!

1294
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,860
That may be true, but you're just running away from things you don't like.

1295
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,840
So what if I am? Why is that so wrong?

1296
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,200
I don't want

1297
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:42,720
this thing!

1298
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:43,620
*Gasp*

1299
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,280
This place again...

1300
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,260
I'm sick of this.

1301
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:58,580
Verify all instructions on recovering fragments of Unit 3 with the technology.

1302
01:20:59,300 --> 01:20:59,740
I'm afraid

1303
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:00,760
anything above Section

1304
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,100
9 is unlikely to have survived.

1305
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,100
Yes,

1306
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,640
prioritize the internal organs.

1307
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,380
No, people waiting. No one near the screen.

1308
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:06,940
We're

1309
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:07,860
gonna take this to the enterprise.

1310
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:08,540
Checking out.

1311
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:12,420
Her cellular tissue is free of infection.

1312
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,600
There's still a chance of psychological contamination.

1313
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,160
We have no choice but to quarantine her.

1314
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,840
Do you think they would go so far as to dispose of her?

1315
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,780
She's a valuable specimen.

1316
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,300
They would never.

1317
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,880
Pilot Shinji Ikari.

1318
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,280
Commander Ikari wants to see you.

1319
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,920
Insubordination.

1320
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,680
Hijacking an Ava.

1321
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,580
Making treasonous threats.

1322
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,580
These are all serious offenses.

1323
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,100
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

1324
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:46,280
Yes.

1325
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,340
I don't ever want to pilot an Ava again.

1326
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:50,420
I see.

1327
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,400
Then you should leave.

1328
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,200
Once again, you're running away.

1329
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,180
You have to sacrifice everything for your dreams.

1330
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,040
And that's something you have to do on your own.

1331
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,500
Nobody else is going to do it for you.

1332
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,540
It's time for you to grow up, Shinji.

1333
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,340
You say that, but I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.

1334
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:24,840
It's Akari.

1335
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,400
Remove the third child from our records.

1336
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,960
Instate the dummy system as the primary

1337
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,360
operator of Unit 1.

1338
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,420
There's no need for a backup.

1339
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:38,020
I guess Rei didn't try to stop Shinji from leaving after all.

1340
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:41,160
She's opened up so much lately. I was hoping she would

1341
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:47,120
Those kids are damn near indecipherable. Yeah, and now we're back down to one pilot

1342
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,640
back to square one again

1343
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,240
I'm sure you already know this but nerve won't just forget about you

1344
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:06,220
They're gonna keep you under surveillance and your actions will be heavily restricted

1345
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,480
You forgot this.

1346
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,580
Kinsuke and Toji have left you a lot of messages.

1347
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,260
They're worried about you.

1348
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,080
I don't really want it.

1349
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,640
I meant to leave it.

1350
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,320
You know, you haven't even asked about Rei or Asuka.

1351
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,180
The truth is,

1352
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,320
I don't think I really care too much about humanity or the world either.

1353
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,940
I know that's kind of strange, given my current position.

1354
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,560
But I wound up here as a way to grow closer to my late father.

1355
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,100
That's why I joined Nerve.

1356
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:45,340
Just like you agreed to pilot the Ava because you wanted your father to need you.

1357
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,040
And because of that, I tried to live vicariously through you.

1358
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,800
And it was wrong of me to put that kind of burden on you.

1359
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,940
And I know how disillusioned you've become about piloting the Ava.

1360
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,100
But I want you to know that I...

1361
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,700
That day, Ray had invited your father.

1362
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,780
She wanted to help the two of you grow closer.

1363
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:20,880
She wanted you to

1364
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,420
laugh together.

1365
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:26,420
I don't think that I'll ever laugh again.

1366
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,020
Next stop, Kamigoro. Kamigoro. Please exit to your left.

1367
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:44,160
Attention, the Japanese government has declared a state of emergency.

1368
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:49,540
In accordance with emergency regulations, this train will stop at the nearest evacuation point.

1369
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,420
After disembarking, please proceed directly to your designated evacuation plan.

1370
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,120
An angel.

1371
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,840
Your final safety system is disabled.

1372
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,540
Removal of all restraints.

1373
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:03,880
You

1374
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,240
guys now

1375
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:04,520
delete.

1376
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,120
It's so cold!

1377
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,440
Almost done.

1378
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,880
30 seconds to insertion.

1379
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,320
Now that's a comfortable fit.

1380
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,660
It's about time they got my measurements right.

1381
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,560
The time is at hand.

1382
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:24,520
All

1383
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,900
personnel, battle station,

1384
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,120
-

1385
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:28,820
- Target

1386
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:29,160
status?

1387
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,100
- It's advancing

1388
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,020
towards the geo-front.

1389
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,660
It just breached the old Otawana defense line.

1390
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,720
If I can feel the shockwave way down here,

1391
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,080
then we're in trouble.

1392
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,680
Directing undisturbed force.

1393
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:02,700
Damage is unknown.

1394
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,420
Service systems have been destroyed.

1395
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,620
That's 27 layers of plate armor vaporized.

1396
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,140
The 10th Angel is cutting a path of carnage to our very heart.

1397
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,380
It's more powerful than we could have imagined.

1398
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,680
Status red.

1399
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:18,620
We need every weapon at our disposal firing at this target.

1400
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,520
Whatever it takes, hold it back.

1401
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,060
They're launching Unit 2?

1402
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,560
Who's piloting it?

1403
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,180
Unknown.

1404
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,660
Operations did not order its launch.

1405
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,640
Target still active.

1406
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,000
I don't care. Evacuate all residents.

1407
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:49,100
Authorizing third wave

1408
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:49,960
of N2 missiles.

1409
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,140
You may launch when ready.

1410
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,220
We don't have time to send an AVA to the surface.

1411
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,880
Request approval from Europe.

1412
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,720
Deploy Unit 2 to the geo front.

1413
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:57,800
House Unit 0.

1414
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,260
Now repairing the left arm.

1415
01:26:59,380 --> 01:26:59,960
It's just

1416
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,500
about ready.

1417
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,720
We needed backing up unit two right away.

1418
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,280
What even is not enough?

1419
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:04,720
Roger.

1420
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:05,800
What about unit one?

1421
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,260
We're activating the dummy system right now.

1422
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,500
Well, it's taking too long.

1423
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:14,520
Isn't that where the city is?

1424
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:15,580
We're gonna be okay.

1425
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,860
We're almost to the GeoFront shelter.

1426
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,000
It's the safest place on the planet.

1427
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:26,980
Service breached!

1428
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,340
Target entering GeoFront!

1429
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,720
Quickly approaching Unit 2!

1430
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,000
Patch me through to Unit 2!

1431
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:32,240
The two-way call link has

1432
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:32,740
been cut off!

1433
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:33,860
We're not getting through!

1434
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:35,480
Is that so?

1435
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,360
They want to do this alone then, huh?

1436
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:46,860
Fresh LCL.

1437
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,620
I don't even mind that it smells like the last pilot.

1438
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,660
It's already breached the fifth line of defense.

1439
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,420
Well, I'd better act fast. Your HQ's done for.

1440
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,760
*Evil's

1441
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,840
Holy crap, that's a strong AT field.

1442
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,340
I can't even touch it from this distance.

1443
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,420
Let's see what this bad boy can do.

1444
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,320
- Quick,

1445
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,180
wait, shithead!

1446
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:57,980
Oh crap!

1447
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,400
Nice move.

1448
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,040
Sneaky bastard.

1449
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,920
Dummy system now connected.

1450
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:11,700
Go. Initiate sequence.

1451
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,480
Yes, ma

1452
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:12,560
'am.

1453
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:13,880
What happened?

1454
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,820
The core units rejected the dummy.

1455
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,040
It's no use.

1456
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:17,880
It won't activate.

1457
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,200
Shut it down.

1458
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,900
Unit 1's refusing the dummy.

1459
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,840
Ruyutski, please

1460
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,020
take command.

1461
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,020
Let's get a better view.

1462
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,060
It's kicking my ass so far.

1463
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:34,540
All right.

1464
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,840
Fingers crossed.

1465
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,980
Let's strip off your humanity.

1466
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,740
No more restraints.

1467
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:41,340
Invert controls.

1468
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:42,880
Backdoor code.

1469
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:44,160
The Beast!

1470
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,060
Bear with it, Unic 2.

1471
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,280
You can do this.

1472
01:29:59,020 --> 01:29:59,920
This isn't easy

1473
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,780
for me either.

1474
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,320
It's physically changing.

1475
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,260
The Restrictors have been disengaged!

1476
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:10,820
The readings are off the chart!

1477
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:12,580
We can't read the plug interior!

1478
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:13,580
Although...

1479
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,420
Must be pushing the negative range.

1480
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:17,640
This girl's clearly willing to risk contamination.

1481
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:19,740
We can't let her! It's too

1482
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:20,140
dangerous!

1483
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:22,620
Nothing ventured...

1484
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,580
Nothing...

1485
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,100
gained...

1486
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,160
That's it!

1487
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,900
Just a... little... more...

1488
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,040
There it is!

1489
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,300
Come on!

1490
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,420
She released its bestial form, but that still wasn't enough for it to defeat the angel.

1491
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,740
We've reached the limit of our capabilities.

1492
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:33,940
You

1493
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,400
need zero?

1494
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,260
She doesn't even have a rifle!

1495
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,540
What's she doing?

1496
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,700
Rey, no, don't do it! Rey!

1497
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,880
AT Field, max level.

1498
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,580
I can do this for him.

1499
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,020
So he never asked a pilot again!

1500
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,960
The field's too strong! A single Ava can't get through it!

1501
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:27,560
All right, Unit 2. This is it! Your final task!

1502
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,640
Just one! One more layer!

1503
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,240
Now run. Get out of here.

1504
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:42,660
Thank you.

1505
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:56,480
Where's Unit Zero?

1506
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:20,320
This shelter has been designated as an unsafe area. Please evacuate immediately to a safe area. I repeat this shelter has been

1507
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,060
Crap that hurt

1508
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:34,280
Almost bit the test back there

1509
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,260
Didn't expect to see you here

1510
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,720
You picked a great time to sit on your ass doing nothing.

1511
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:44,700
Well, I...

1512
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,360
I made up my mind not to pilot anymore.

1513
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:53,080
Sounds like a pretty big conflict for you.

1514
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,560
Don't you have better things to agonize over?

1515
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:59,260
Well, there's no point in you sitting on the battlefield.

1516
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,060
Here, I'll help you out.

1517
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:07,840
I'm not gonna pilot it.

1518
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,240
I'm not gonna do it! I won't pilot anymore!

1519
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,760
I don't get it.

1520
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,120
What good is it doing you to sit around feeling all twisted up and sorry for yourself?

1521
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,160
*Gasp*

1522
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:46,600
*Gasp*

1523
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:49,560
*Gasp*

1524
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:03,700
Is it devouring the Ava?

1525
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:05,220
Impossible!

1526
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:10,040
This is strange. The Angel's ID pattern is becoming identical to Unit Zero!

1527
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:11,240
Then we're done for!

1528
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,180
The central Dompa's self-destruct system, it won't trigger.

1529
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,300
That thing can walk right up to Lilith.

1530
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:17,240
It's

1531
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,340
physically merging with Unit Zero.

1532
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,200
It absorbed the pilot and everything.

1533
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,660
You're gonna get killed if you stick around.

1534
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:28,160
You need to get out of here.

1535
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,820
Oh, well. There he goes, I guess.

1536
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:53,400
Oh, my God!

1537
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,100
- The shaft is completely exposed!

1538
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:14,880
- Is Unit One functioning?

1539
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,460
- Uninco-Wander plug in place!

1540
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:22,520
Dummy system rejecting connection signal!

1541
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:24,300
- Keep trying.

1542
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,980
Reset and begin again from

1543
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,700
Brio 8.

1544
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:29,560
- Why now?

1545
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,900
Why are you rejecting me now,

1546
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:32,920
Huey?

1547
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:33,780
- Let me

1548
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:34,460
pilot it!

1549
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,280
Please, please!

1550
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,420
You have to let me pilot Unit One!

1551
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,120
What are you doing here?

1552
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:49,900
Father!

1553
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:51,440
It's me!

1554
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,900
The pilot of Evangelion Unit 1!

1555
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,600
Shinji Ikari!

1556
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,560
The target is now descending through Dogma Layer 7!

1557
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:03,420
The target has

1558
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,300
passed Layer 7!

1559
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,740
It's heading down here!

1560
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,100
Evacuate non-combatants!

1561
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,500
Emergency evacuation of non-combatants!

1562
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,060
I repeat this...

1563
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,260
Unit 1?

1564
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:26,600
It's Shinji!

1565
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:50,500
- Is that how?

1566
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,320
- The platform, disengage more.

1567
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:02,980
No!

1568
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,340
You can't be serious!

1569
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:25,100
Unit 1, it's reached its limit, and the backup power is down!

1570
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,120
But Shinji...

1571
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:43,420
Shinji!

1572
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:50,440
I want Rey!

1573
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:52,640
Give her back!

1574
01:38:56,679 --> 01:38:58,140
It's getting back up?

1575
01:38:58,720 --> 01:38:59,080
It's

1576
01:38:59,080 --> 01:38:59,600
past its

1577
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,600
operational limit!

1578
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,560
Has it gone berserk?

1579
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:04,860
I don't know.

1580
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:07,960
I don't even know how this is possible.

1581
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,900
I'm not sure what

1582
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:56,660
It has that kind of power?

1583
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:59,700
It's transcending the boundaries of humanity.

1584
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,480
The plug depth has already passed 180.

1585
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,140
His life's in danger.

1586
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,700
Shinji, please stop.

1587
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:07,740
You won't be able to come back.

1588
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:10,020
I don't care what happens to me.

1589
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:12,640
I don't even care what happens to the world.

1590
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,880
But I'm bringing Rey back.

1591
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:19,460
I promise I'll save you, Rey, even if it's the last thing I do!

1592
01:40:33,219 --> 01:40:34,880
You can do it, Shinji!

1593
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,620
- I'm sorry

1594
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:07,480
Even if I disappear, there are replacements.

1595
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,180
There are replacements.

1596
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:09,840
You're

1597
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,260
wrong! You're the only ray there is!

1598
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:15,080
And I'm saving you! Right now!

1599
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:39,100
Oh no! Physical restrictors have deteriorated! I can't analyze it!

1600
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:46,280
Eva has broken free of our confines. It's reclaiming its natural shape, casting aside humanity,

1601
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:53,360
transcending its physical form to become a divine being, weaving together the heavens and earth,

1602
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:59,800
becoming one with all of creation, expanding and transforming itself into pure energy.

1603
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:06,380
All at the behest of a single human being, just to grant his desire.

1604
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:36,940
I'm here, Ray!

1605
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:56,060
Ray, come on!

1606
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,560
Take my hand!

1607
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:19,620
Reach out!

1608
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:24,360
Reach!

1609
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:45,640
I'm a woman, I'm

1610
01:43:59,159 --> 01:43:59,760
You

1611
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,440
forced Unit One to become the catalyst before they had their pieces in place.

1612
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:08,080
Well, Commander, Sailor won't take this line down.

1613
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:11,060
We were right. Their unity

1614
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:13,000
was enough to awaken Unit One.

1615
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:16,800
Indeed. It won't be long before our plan is complete.

1616
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,920
We're almost finished.

1617
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,180
Thank you, Ray.

1618
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,120
for trying to bring me and my dad together.

1619
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,980
I'm sorry I couldn't.

1620
01:44:30,490 --> 01:44:31,900
I wanted you to be happy.

1621
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:33,900
It doesn't matter.

1622
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,360
This is all I need.

1623
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,820
I get it now.

1624
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:49,740
Things just work out for him, huh?

1625
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:53,140
I wonder if that's the reason he smells so good.

1626
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,140
And dance!

1627
01:45:26,019 --> 01:45:34,900
The nascence of a divine life-form and the toll of its creation is the demise of all life that came before it.

1628
01:45:42,579 --> 01:45:44,380
Wings. I've seen them

1629
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:44,720
before.

1630
01:45:47,059 --> 01:45:52,160
Yes, it's just like fifteen years ago. The third impact is beginning.

1631
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,660
This is the end of the world.

1632
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:25,780
Let's go.

1633
01:47:52,320 --> 01:48:19,380
I don't know what I'm saying

1634
01:48:52,400 --> 01:49:07,140
I'll be a little

1635
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:25,640
I don't know.

1636
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,540
If you have a single one,

1637
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:00,800
please be in your side.

1638
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:11,220
Oh,

1639
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,300
Temple World

1640
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:17,360
What was that?

1641
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:25,620
This is it. The time has arrived, Shinji Akari.

1642
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:29,100
And I give you my solemn word.

1643
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,620
I'll show you true happiness.

1644
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,300
Unit 1 is contained with Rei and Shinji still inside.

1645
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:40,480
The city is laid to waste.

1646
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:42,020
The Nerve staff is incarcerated.

1647
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,700
Unit 6 descends through Central Dogma.

1648
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:47,260
Unit 8 is given a pilot and brought to life.

1649
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:49,940
Bound by fate, the children finally come together.

1650
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,640
With their continued desire to live further challenge,

1651
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,940
where will the tale of our heroes lead us?

1652
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:58,440
Next time, Evangelion Theatrical Edition Q.

1653
01:51:59,100 --> 01:51:59,780
All right then,

1654
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,100
more fan service coming

1655
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:01,500
soon.
