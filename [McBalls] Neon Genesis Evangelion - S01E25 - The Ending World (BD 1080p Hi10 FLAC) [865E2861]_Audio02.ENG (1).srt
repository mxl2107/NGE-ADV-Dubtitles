1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,720
Speaker 1: The young man like a young man

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,720
Speaker 1: The young man, you are a fairy tale

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,900
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now on the door

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,800
Speaker 1: I can only see you, but I'm smiling and smiling.

5
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:49,100
Speaker 1: I'm so sure you can touch me, but I'm not sure I can.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,920
Speaker 1: But I'll see you soon, right?

7
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,000
Speaker 1: The future will be a place for the future.

8
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,700
Speaker 1: The crazy thing is that the world is in the window.

9
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
Speaker 1: I'm going to be a hot hot potter

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,500
Speaker 1: I'm going to be afraid of my dreams

11
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,080
Speaker 1: I'm going to be a light in the sky

12
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,140
Speaker 1: I'm a young man, you're a fairy tale

13
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,200
*Sexy music*

14
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,340
Speaker 2: There was no other choice!

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Speaker 2: Because he was an angel!

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,800
Speaker 2: Koro was an angel!

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,320
Speaker 2: He was still an angel!

18
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,120
Speaker 2: He was still one of the enemy!

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,500
Speaker 2: He wasn't!

20
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,220
Speaker 2: He wasn't!

21
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,400
Speaker 2: He wasn't!

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Speaker 3: Even though he was as human as me?

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,240
Speaker 2: No!

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
Speaker 2: He was an angel!

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,060
Speaker 2: Is that why

26
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,680
Speaker 3: you killed him?

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,420
Speaker 3: Yes!

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,340
Speaker 3: Otherwise we'd all die!

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,120
Speaker 4: We'd have all been destroyed!

30
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,160
Speaker 4: So that's why you killed him.

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,800
Speaker 4: I didn't want to kill him!

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,560
Speaker 4: I didn't have a choice.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Speaker 4: Help me!

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
Speaker 4: Please, just help me!

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,940
Speaker 4: For God's sake, help me!

36
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,560
Speaker 4: Somebody please help me!

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,740
Speaker 4: Is anyone

38
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,220
Speaker 5: listening?

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,760
Speaker 5: Somebody please help me!

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,640
Speaker 5: I'm taking you!

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,380
Speaker 6: He was much better than I am.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,160
Speaker 6: Karu

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,060
Speaker 7: should have survived, not me.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,940
Speaker 7: No. The one who deserves to survive is the one who has the will to make it happen.

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,840
Speaker 7: He wished for death.

46
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,280
Speaker 7: He ignored his will to survive and chose to die for a false hope.

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,660
Speaker 7: Survival is not a mistake, Shinji.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Speaker 6: Are you sure? Are you sure it was right?

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Speaker 7: I don't understand. What can I do?

50
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,080
Speaker 6: What am I supposed to do?

51
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,200
Speaker 6: What was that?

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,960
Speaker 6: I fear myself?

53
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,220
Speaker 6: I fear being hated?

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,420
Speaker 6: But by whom?

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,760
Speaker 6: Who is it?

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,000
Speaker 6: It's my...

57
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,080
Speaker 6: My father abandoned me!

58
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,000
Speaker 6: He hates me!

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,820
Speaker 6: If others hate me, what will I do?

60
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,140
Speaker 6: What will I do?

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,520
Speaker 6: Where am I? Where am I supposed to go? I can't see anything. I don't understand what I feel.

62
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,260
Speaker 6: Misato? Misato!

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,620
Speaker 6: Hey! Where are you, Misato? I can't see!

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,239
Speaker 6: Hey, where am I supposed to go?

65
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,560
Speaker 6: Misato? Asuka? Ainami? Toji? Kintsugi? Ritsuko? Gaji?

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,840
Speaker 7: Father?

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,440
Speaker 6: Mother...

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840
Speaker 6: Somebody please tell me what I have to do now!

69
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,180
Speaker 6: Evangelion Unit 1.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,920
Speaker 6: I still have to pilot it? Even after it made me kill him?

71
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,400
Speaker 6: My father and the others tell me that I have to pilot it no matter what I want.

72
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,920
Speaker 6: Why do I have to keep fighting after all that's happened?

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,080
Speaker 6: Mother! Say something!

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,380
Speaker 5: Answer me!

75
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,860
Speaker 6: Because everyone tells me to.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,140
Speaker 6: What do you mean? It's for the sake of mankind. Isn't that good enough?

77
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,560
Speaker 6: That's right. Is there something wrong with that? I'm doing the right thing.

78
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,920
Speaker 6: And when I do it, the others appreciate me. The

79
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,260
Speaker 8: others like me then.

80
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
Speaker 8: You're lying.

81
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,160
Speaker 8: Huh?

82
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,260
Speaker 8: Are you stupid? You know damn well that you do this for yourself.

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,340
Speaker 8: Huh?

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,780
Speaker 8: You're just making up excuses like you

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,100
Speaker 6: always

86
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,580
Speaker 8: do.

87
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,680
Speaker 6: I do?

88
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,980
Speaker 8: Pretending you're sacrificing yourself is just another cop-out.

89
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,820
Speaker 8: It makes you feel so special to play the martyr.

90
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,080
Speaker 6: I'm not sure that's true.

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,420
Speaker 8: You're feeling lonely and isolated, nothing more.

92
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,300
Speaker 8: Am I?

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,520
Speaker 8: Of course you are!

94
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,060
Speaker 8: You live on sympathy and you get it with your Eva, Shinji!

95
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,960
Speaker 8: It could be true.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,600
Speaker 8: You love having others depend upon you.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,340
Speaker 8: It satisfies your twisted little mind.

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Speaker 8: That could be...

99
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,280
Speaker 8: If you want real happiness, you've got to find it for yourself.

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,900
Speaker 8: not wait for someone to give it to you.

101
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,280
Speaker 9: I didn't want to be in this thing again.

102
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,800
Speaker 9: They're forcing me to buy like this.

103
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,880
Speaker 9: But this piece of junk won't work.

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,080
Speaker 9: But it's only junk because of what I've become.

105
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,780
Speaker 9: I'm the garbage

106
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,300
Speaker 5: now.

107
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,220
Speaker 9: I'm worthless.

108
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,200
Speaker 9: Nobody needs me.

109
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,180
Speaker 9: Nobody needs a pilot who can't even control her own Ava.

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Speaker 9: - You seek your own value in the perception of others.

111
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,540
Speaker 3: - Shut up!

112
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,220
Speaker 3: - Do you fear being alone?

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,940
Speaker 3: Do you fear being alone?

114
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,640
Speaker 3: Are you afraid that you will lose your identity

115
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,800
Speaker 3: if others leave you?

116
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,420
Speaker 8: - You pilot Ava so you'll be preyed.

117
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,700
Speaker 8: - Shut up!

118
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,020
Speaker 8: Shut up!

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,180
Speaker 8: Leave me alone!

120
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,960
Speaker 8: How can a wind-up doll like you dare tell

121
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,620
Speaker 3: me that?

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:01,720
Speaker 3: What?

123
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,460
Speaker 3: Who

124
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,280
Speaker 5: am I?

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
Speaker 3: You are Rei Ayanami.

126
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,860
Speaker 3: But who are you?

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,480
Speaker 3: Are you Rei Ayanami as well?

128
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,140
Speaker 3: Correct.

129
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,980
Speaker 3: I'm the thing that is recognized as Rei Ayanami.

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,300
Speaker 3: We are all things that are recognized as Rei Ayanami.

131
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,740
Speaker 3: How could all of those possibly be me?

132
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,940
Speaker 3: It is simply because the others call us Rei Ayanami.

133
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,320
Speaker 3: That is the only reason.

134
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 3: You possess a false body and a fake soul.

135
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,580
Speaker 3: Do you know why?

136
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,140
Speaker 3: I am neither false nor fake. I am simply me.

137
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,460
Speaker 3: No. You are an empty shell with a false soul created by a man named Gendo Ikari.

138
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,700
Speaker 3: You are just an object that is pretending to be a human.

139
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaker 3: Look deep within yourself.

140
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,940
Speaker 3: Do you perceive the almost intangible and invisible presence that lurks below your waking self?

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,120
Speaker 3: Inside your darkest dreams.

142
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,140
Speaker 3: It is there that your true identity lies.

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
Speaker 3: No. I am me.

144
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,000
Speaker 3: I became myself by the instrumentality of the links and relationships between myself and others.

145
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,480
Speaker 3: I am formed by interaction with others. They create me as I create them.

146
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,560
Speaker 3: These relationships and interactions serve to shape the patterns of my heart and mind.

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,540
Speaker 3: Yes, that is the name for what I share with those who have created the thing known as Ray.

148
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,200
Speaker 3: That is what will continue to shape me.

149
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,520
Speaker 3: But there is someone else who is your true self.

150
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,060
Speaker 3: You don't know her, but she exists.

151
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,060
Speaker 3: You deny that fact and attempt to suppress that facet of your reality.

152
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,240
Speaker 3: Because she might not have human form.

153
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,120
Speaker 3: Because then the present self might cease to be.

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
Speaker 3: This is what you fear.

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,700
Speaker 3: That you will become nothing.

156
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,400
Speaker 3: You are frightened that you will disappear from the minds of others if another exists.

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,040
Speaker 3: I'm afraid. Why is that? Because your current self will have never existed.

158
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,100
Speaker 3: Because you will cease to be.

159
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,020
Speaker 3: No, I'm not. I am happy.

160
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,040
Speaker 3: Because I want to die.

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Speaker 3: I want despair.

162
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,980
Speaker 3: I want to return to nothing.

163
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Speaker 3: But I can't.

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,580
Speaker 3: You won't let me return to nothingness.

165
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,680
Speaker 3: Not yet.

166
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,260
Speaker 3: I still exist because he needs me.

167
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,200
Speaker 3: But when everything is over, when I am of no use anymore, he will abandon me.

168
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,600
Speaker 3: I've prayed for the day he would abandon me.

169
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,360
Speaker 3: But now,

170
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,360
Speaker 10: now I fear it.

171
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,000
Speaker 11: Come, let us go.

172
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,840
Speaker 11: This is the day for which you were created, Ray.

173
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,300
Speaker 3: Yes, sir.

174
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Speaker 6: What? What feeling is this? I think I've experienced this sensation before. It's as though my physical form was disappearing. It feels agreeable, as though my existence is spreading itself out to cover the entire existence.

175
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 11: Incorrect. It is not a return to nothingness.

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Speaker 11: It is merely a return to a state of beginning.

177
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,780
Speaker 11: It is no less than a return to the primal womb that we lost so long ago.

178
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,400
Speaker 11: Souls and minds will become one, attaining eternal balance.

179
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,980
Speaker 11: The final goal is nothing more than that.

180
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,540
Speaker 12: And that's instrumentality.

181
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,100
Speaker 12: Yes, there is an emptiness at the very core of our souls.

182
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,800
Speaker 12: A fundamental incompleteness that has haunted all beings since the very first thought.

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,020
Speaker 12: On a primal level, man has always been aware of the darkness that resides at the core of his mind.

184
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,180
Speaker 12: We have seeked to escape from this void and the fear it causes,

185
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,220
Speaker 12: and all man's accomplishments were made in the hope of filling it.

186
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,100
Speaker 7: And so you'll just crush everyone's minds together to fill the gaps?

187
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,300
Speaker 7: Who made you humanity's overseer?

188
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,080
Speaker 7: You came to us bearing an offer of help, yet your benevolence has proved to be as false as our friendship.

189
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,680
Speaker 7: And yet that is exactly as you wished it to be.

190
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,580
Speaker 7: Where am I?

191
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,960
Speaker 6: This is the me that exists in your mind, Misato.

192
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,000
Speaker 7: And yet at the same time, this is also the me which exists in your mind.

193
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,860
Speaker 7: Isn't it, Shinji?

194
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Speaker 6: In order to establish my identity, I have to communicate with the minds of many people.

195
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,200
Speaker 6: I have to examine that which is at my core.

196
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,100
Speaker 6: I have to stare at Misato, who resides on the inside of my mind.

197
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,060
Speaker 6: What is it that you wish for, Misato?

198
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,380
Speaker 13: I have to be a good child.

199
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,260
Speaker 13: Because I have no daddy.

200
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Speaker 13: Because I have to be good and not bother my mommy.

201
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,080
Speaker 13: But I don't want to become like my mom.

202
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,420
Speaker 13: When my father is not here, she always cries.

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,740
Speaker 13: I can't cry. I can't depend on anyone else.

204
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,400
Speaker 13: So I have to be good.

205
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,740
Speaker 13: That way maybe my father won't hate me as much.

206
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,240
Speaker 13: I hope. Maybe my father won't hate me if I'd be good.

207
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,320
Speaker 7: But I hated my father.

208
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,760
Speaker 7: And I hated being a good child.

209
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,680
Speaker 7: I hate it. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of keeping myself clean.

210
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Speaker 7: I'm tired of pretending to be pure and noble.

211
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,580
Speaker 7: I'm so tired of it all.

212
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,220
Speaker 7: I want to disgrace myself to get so dirty that no one can stand it.

213
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,620
Speaker 7: I want to see my life and my reputation ruined.

214
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,280
Speaker 7: Is that why you slept with him? With Kaji?

215
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,980
Speaker 7: No, I slept with him because I love him.

216
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,120
Speaker 7: You did? Did you really love him?

217
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,800
Speaker 7: Yes, I did. He accepted me as myself for the real me.

218
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,000
Speaker 7: That's why I let him make love to me

219
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,580
Speaker 7: No, don't show Cindy this I don't want him to see that side of me

220
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,040
Speaker 14: Why are you still embarrassed after all that's happened?

221
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,100
Speaker 7: Because I'm ashamed of it

222
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,939
Speaker 7: Why does this embarrass you? You weren't ashamed then

223
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,400
Speaker 7: You were glad to show your true nature to the man you loved. In fact, you took great pleasure in it.

224
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Speaker 7: No, don't do this!

225
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,520
Speaker 7: You wanted to dirty yourself.

226
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,060
Speaker 7: You should be happy to show this side of yourself to Shinji, shouldn't you?

227
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Speaker 7: No!

228
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,460
Speaker 2: No, no!

229
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,640
Speaker 7: Are you sure? Or is it perhaps your father that you'd like to show this to?

230
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,100
Speaker 7: No!

231
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,640
Speaker 7: Wasn't it really peace of mind that you were seeking in Kaji's bed?

232
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,120
Speaker 7: No!

233
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,840
Speaker 7: You wanted peace of mind and warmth from Kaji then?

234
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,560
Speaker 7: No!

235
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,540
Speaker 7: You wanted to find your father in Kaji's embrace, didn't you?

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,880
Speaker 7: Is that true?

237
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,240
Speaker 7: It is true.

238
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,760
Speaker 7: In Kaji, I had found my father reborn.

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,120
Speaker 7: And so I fled from him.

240
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,840
Speaker 7: I was so afraid.

241
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,080
Speaker 7: He was so much like my father.

242
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,520
Speaker 7: But at the same time, I was also very happy.

243
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,640
Speaker 7: I was never happier.

244
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,360
Speaker 7: That was such a wonderful time.

245
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,840
Speaker 7: That's why I hated it.

246
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,020
Speaker 7: That's why I left.

247
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,820
Speaker 7: That's why I ran away.

248
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,120
Speaker 14: So, no reason was required to begin our love,

249
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,060
Speaker 14: but you needed a reason for ending it.

250
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,800
Speaker 7: Yes, you were so kind, Kashi.

251
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,020
Speaker 7: You were so kind to disgrace me,

252
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,180
Speaker 7: to dirty me,

253
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,060
Speaker 7: to deflower me.

254
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,420
Speaker 14: Just because you hate yourself

255
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,640
Speaker 14: is no reason to injure yourself further.

256
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,159
Speaker 14: Punishing yourself is simply a cheat

257
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,300
Speaker 14: to make you feel better for a little while.

258
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,540
Speaker 14: Don't do this to yourself.

259
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,100
Speaker 7: And now you'll tell me to take care of myself?

260
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,640
Speaker 7: Men always do that.

261
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,720
Speaker 7: They'll escape to their jobs,

262
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,060
Speaker 7: their own world,

263
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,660
Speaker 7: and leave me behind.

264
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,080
Speaker 7: They always leave me behind.

265
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,360
Speaker 6: Always.

266
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,260
Speaker 7: Just like our father did.

267
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,960
Speaker 7: They always escape from the harsh realities.

268
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,200
Speaker 7: Harsh reality.

269
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,940
Speaker 7: I am his harsh reality.

270
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,380
Speaker 7: Of course, I am the problem.

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,340
Speaker 7: Stop this!

272
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,260
Speaker 7: Misato.

273
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,980
Speaker 7: Why should anyone else love me anyway? I hate myself!

274
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,340
Speaker 10: You're vulgar and impure.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,560
Speaker 10: You're pathetic.

276
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,600
Speaker 8: You're gross and disgusting! I've never seen anyone in such a

277
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Speaker 7: disgusting relationship!

278
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,660
Speaker 11: Congratulations on your promotion, Major Katsuragi.

279
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,860
Speaker 7: The me who's recognized is the me who's performing a role in order to be appreciated.

280
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,700
Speaker 7: But she's not the real me.

281
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,840
Speaker 7: Your true self is always crying, isn't she?

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,600
Speaker 7: Yes, but I am happy.

283
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,840
Speaker 7: I am happy.

284
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,480
Speaker 7: It's true, I am happy.

285
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,420
Speaker 7: I'm not! This isn't the happiness I want!

286
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
Speaker 7: This isn't me! It is not

287
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,920
Speaker 2: the true myself!

288
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,140
Speaker 2: I just don't want to face our reality!

289
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,200
Speaker 6: But we have to. We cannot live otherwise.

290
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,820
Speaker 6: You know you'd be alone and afraid.

291
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,200
Speaker 12: Unstable.

292
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,560
Speaker 12: If nobody was sleeping next to you.

293
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,360
Speaker 10: Are you afraid of sleeping alone?

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,740
Speaker 10: Or does sleeping by yourself remind you of how empty your life is?

295
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,520
Speaker 14: She can't stand not having other souls around her.

296
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,940
Speaker 14: So, you'll sleep with anyone, won't you, Major?

297
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,620
Speaker 7: No!

298
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,780
Speaker 7: Yes, you just want to be infatuated with primal ecstasy.

299
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,840
Speaker 7: You want to fill the hole in your heart with temporary escape.

300
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,180
Speaker 7: You take advantage of men to soothe the pain in your soul.

301
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,220
Speaker 7: No!

302
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,520
No! No!

303
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,800
Speaker 7: Where am I?

304
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,140
Speaker 6: What do you want, Oscar?

305
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,480
Speaker 8: I want to live by myself.

306
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,280
Speaker 8: I don't want my papa and my mama.

307
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,840
Speaker 8: I'll live by myself.

308
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,980
Speaker 8: And then I won't cry anymore.

309
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,140
Speaker 8: But I'm still crying. Why am I crying?

310
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,459
Speaker 8: I'm a

311
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,560
son. I just don't like her.

312
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,740
Speaker 7: What happened to you with the able

313
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,280
Speaker 11: doctor?

314
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,520
I told you, I'm a human being before I was told.

315
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,959
Speaker 11: But how can a trained person like you?

316
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,280
Speaker 11: She acts too much like

317
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,699
a dog, and she would chase me absolutely.

318
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Speaker 7: Sometimes she even scares me.

319
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:31,800
Speaker 7: Have

320
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 6: you had

321
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Speaker 7: such a feeling with her?

322
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,880
Speaker 7: No. And in any case, you will not become Asuka's mother.

323
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,340
Speaker 9: I'm your wife before that.

324
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,660
Speaker 11: Both duties are concurrent.

325
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,440
Speaker 9: In a social perspective, yes.

326
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,060
Speaker 9: But you can't be being her father.

327
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,200
Speaker 6: However, I can quit being her mother anytime.

328
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
Speaker 8: You can say that.

329
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,160
Speaker 8: No, Mama!

330
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,060
Speaker 6: Don't

331
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,760
Speaker 8: leave me!

332
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,100
Speaker 2: I'll be good! Promise!

333
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Speaker 2: Don't stop being my mother!

334
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,820
Speaker 2: Don't ignore me!

335
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,020
Speaker 2: No,

336
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,580
Mama!

337
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,640
Don't kill me!

338
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,920
Speaker 15: Your Papa hates your Mama.

339
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,020
Speaker 15: He doesn't need me anymore.

340
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,420
Speaker 15: No.

341
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,740
Speaker 15: He didn't love me to begin with.

342
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,660
Speaker 15: But let's die together.

343
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,960
Speaker 15: Because he doesn't want us.

344
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,300
Speaker 15: He didn't need me at all.

345
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,200
Speaker 15: And he doesn't want you either, Asuka.

346
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,140
Speaker 15: I'm not wanted?

347
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,420
Speaker 15: I'm not

348
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,340
Speaker 8: worth anything?

349
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,580
Speaker 15: Die with me.

350
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,400
Speaker 8: No! I am not your doll!

351
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,500
Speaker 8: I'll think by myself and live by myself!

352
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,740
Speaker 8: And then my mother was hanging from the ceiling.

353
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,840
Speaker 8: She looked so happy.

354
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,020
Speaker 8: But I hated how she looked.

355
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Speaker 8: I don't want to die.

356
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,040
Speaker 8: I don't want to disappear.

357
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,420
Speaker 8: I hate this.

358
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,420
Speaker 8: I hate boys.

359
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,660
Speaker 8: I hate my father and my mother!

360
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,300
Speaker 8: I hate everyone!

361
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,280
Speaker 8: Nobody cares about me, nobody stays with me!

362
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,880
Speaker 8: So I don't want to depend on anybody!

363
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,560
Speaker 8: But I hate it at the same time!

364
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Speaker 8: It's a pain!

365
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,260
Speaker 8: I don't want to be alone!

366
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,680
Speaker 8: I don't want to be alone! I don't want to be alone!

367
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,680
Speaker 7: Don't leave me.

368
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,520
Speaker 7: Don't ignore me.

369
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,080
Speaker 8: Don't kill me!

370
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,360
Speaker 7: What the hell is this?

371
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,540
Speaker 7: This is the instrumentality which your father has initiated.

372
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,780
Speaker 7: This is it?

373
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,200
Speaker 7: This is part of it.

374
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,260
Speaker 7: You can't tell what the truth

375
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,980
Speaker 12: is, Shee.

376
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,200
Speaker 12: Truth is subjective.

377
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,600
Speaker 12: Therefore, you can barely tell that what you can feel is fact.

378
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,460
Speaker 12: The truth is within you.

379
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,040
Speaker 6: And the facts that remain in your memory are what will become your truth.

380
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,660
Speaker 12: Truth can be changed from time to time.

381
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,540
Speaker 3: Sometimes.

382
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,620
Speaker 3: This is all fact. This is the result of everything?

383
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,520
Speaker 3: This is real, but one of many realities.

384
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,860
Speaker 3: This is the conclusion you wanted.

385
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Speaker 3: Wanted? Me?

386
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,860
Speaker 3: Yes. Total destruction.

387
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,940
Speaker 3: You wished for a world in which nobody would be saved.

388
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,080
Speaker 3: No! I didn't wish

389
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,020
for this! The others didn't save me!

390
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,400
Speaker 8: Nobody can

391
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Speaker 12: save you from yourself.

392
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,120
Speaker 14: This is what you wished for.

393
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,240
Speaker 8: destruction, death, and return to nothingness.

394
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,380
Speaker 8: You wished

395
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,920
Speaker 6: for these.

396
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,340
Speaker 6: This is the reality that is.

397
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,940
Speaker 6: What is reality?

398
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,600
Speaker 6: This is your world.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,720
Speaker 11: A world that exists solely for yourself.

400
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,000
Speaker 11: One without time, space,

401
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,020
or anyone else.

402
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,060
Speaker 11: A world in which every

403
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,020
Speaker 6: facet is determined by you.

404
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,520
Speaker 10: This is the world in which you just wait for others to give you something.

405
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,400
Speaker 10: This is your world unless you decide to change reality.

406
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,320
Speaker 7: This is the world that is! Nothing can change that!

407
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,700
Speaker 7: No. You yourself make the decision.

408
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,220
Speaker 7: This is the world

409
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,400
we remind ourselves now.

410
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,220
Speaker 6: Whether it is the will to survive...

411
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,780
Speaker 8: ...or a wish for death, it is all up to you.

412
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,660
Speaker 6: Are you saying that this darkness, this insane world, are what I really wish to create?

413
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,380
Speaker 6: Yes.

414
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,080
Speaker 14: You wished for a closed world that was comfortable for you.

415
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,860
Speaker 14: To protect your few pleasures.

416
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,900
Speaker 10: This is merely the result of your wish.

417
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,600
Speaker 7: In your closed world, in a world where only you are allowed to be, others cannot live with you.

418
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Speaker 12: But still you wished to close off the world that surrounded you.

419
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,260
Speaker 12: Your wish ejected things you disliked and created an isolated and lonely world filled with nothing.

420
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,340
Speaker 3: This is the world your wishes have created.

421
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
Speaker 3: A private haven in the recesses of your mind.

422
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,240
Speaker 8: This is how it all ends. One of many possible endings.

423
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,860
Speaker 8: This

424
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,620
Speaker 3: is the ending you brought upon yourself.

425
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,460
Speaker 3: You choose this fate.

426
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,940
Speaker 3: You choose this

427
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,420
fate.

428
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,980
Speaker 1: Fly me to the

429
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,540
Speaker 8: moon and let me play among the stars

430
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
Speaker 8: Let me see what spring is like, oh Jupiter

431
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,220
Speaker 1: and

432
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,640
Speaker 8: Mars

433
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,240
Speaker 1: In other worlds, hold my hand

434
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,080
Speaker 1: In other words,

435
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,220
Speaker 5: dearly kiss me

436
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,920
Speaker 5: Feel my heartbeat so, and let me sing forever more

437
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,500
Speaker 5: You are all I know, all I want is a planet

438
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,860
Speaker 5: Another world, please be true

439
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,120
Speaker 5: Another world,

440
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,940
I love you

441
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,480
Speaker 7: An end always comes after a beginning.

442
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,040
Speaker 7: Will our hopes result in ultimate destruction?

443
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,240
Speaker 7: Is our whole existence death itself?

444
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,360
Speaker 7: It's our final episode,

445
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,640
Speaker 7: the beast that shouted,

446
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,280
Speaker 7: I in the heart of the world.

447
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,960
you
