Speaker 1
The young man like a young man You are a young man, you are a fairy tale The wind is now on the door, but I just see you, I'm smiling. I'm so happy to see you, but I'm so happy to see you. But I'll tell you that I'll find the way behind I will be shining in the sky I will be a fairy tale

Speaker 2
Correct. I have already made the necessary arrangements with the committee. The cargo left port yesterday. It's making its way over here.

Speaker 3
Wow! A MiG-55D transport helicopter! I never thought I'd actually get a chance to fly on one of these hot mamas! Man, it's great having a famous buddy like you, right, Shinji? Huh? Yeah, I thought you must be getting sick of being cramped up in the mountains, So I thought it'd be kinda nice

Speaker 4
to invite you guys to come along with me on this little date. What? Are

Speaker 3
you saying that this is really a date we're having, Misato? And I bought this cap especially for today, just for you. I'll never take it off. So, where are we going?

Speaker 4
Oh, we're just taking a cruise on that cute little boat down there.

Speaker 3
Oh my god! One, two, three, four, five aircraft carriers and four battleships! What a fleet! That's your cute little boat? She's gorgeous! That's the pride of the UN

Speaker 4
combined fleet,

Speaker 3
the super carrier over the rainbow! It's enormous.

Speaker 4
Personally, I'm surprised it's such a crusty old relic and still float.

Speaker 3
Nah, it's not so bad. It's a vintage model from just before the second impact.

Speaker 5
Damn, give me a break. It looks like they've brought the power cables for that children's toy of theirs. Give me a break.

Speaker 3
*Dramatic

Speaker 6
music - Stop,

Speaker 3
damn you! That's my special hat! Stop it, someone! Come on, stop it!

Speaker 6
- What? - Well, hello,

Speaker 4
Misato. How have you been? - Just fine. Goodness, you've grown some, haven't you? - Uh-huh.

Speaker 7
And

Speaker 4
I'm not just taller.

Speaker 7
My figure spilled out as well.

Speaker 4
- Let me introduce you. This is the designated pilot of Eva Unit 2, the second child, Asuka Langley Soryu.

Speaker 7
*Sigh*

Speaker 5
- Hmm, nerve. From your antics on the dick, I was quite sure you were the leader of this Boy Scout troop. Obviously, I was mistaken.

Speaker 4
- Thank you for all your gracious hospitality, Admiral.

Speaker 5
- Oh no, thank you for giving me the opportunity to babysit so many more children.

Speaker 4
- And thank you for your assistance in the marine transport of AVA Unit 2. Here are the specifications for the emergency power supply.

Speaker 5
Hmph, you've wasted a trip. I'd never approve any request to activate that toy while at sea in the first place.

Speaker 4
Think of it as being prepared for an emergency. The HAVA is quite valuable, sir.

Speaker 5
So valuable that the entire Pacific Fleet has to be pulled for guard duty?

Speaker 8
Exactly when did the UN recommission us into a bloody cargo service? If my memory serves me correctly, it was just after a certain organization was established. Guarding a toy? What a ridiculously

Speaker 5
grandiose assignment for the entire Pacific Fleet! It's

Speaker 4
still not enough. Not when you consider the importance of the EVA. Sign these transfer documents, please. Not

Speaker 5
yet. EVA Unit

Speaker 4
2 and

Speaker 5
its pilot have been entrusted to us by the Third Branch in Germany. You're just not gonna waltz in and do as you please, Captain Katsuragi.

Speaker 4
When will you transfer them to us?

Speaker 5
Once we've unloaded in New Yokosuka. The ocean is our jurisdiction. You will follow our orders here.

Speaker 4
I understand. However, I should remind you that in an emergency, Nerves military authority overrides your own. She's awesome. She sounds just like Ritsuko. Kaji!

Speaker 5
Mr. Kaji, I

Speaker 4
must insist that

Speaker 5
you stop inviting yourself onto the bridge. Oh, sorry about that.

Speaker 4
Please excuse

Speaker 6
us.

Speaker 4
Transport us

Speaker 6
to new Yoko Suka as order.

Speaker 8
Damn, those children are mankind's salvation? I suppose the times are changing, sir. I understand that Congress has pinned its hopes on that robot as well. On that child's plaything? What idiots!

Speaker 5
If they've got the money to blow on that, they ought to give us a little more.

Speaker 4
What are you doing here?

Speaker 5
Accompanying

Speaker 9
her. I'm on a business trip of sorts.

Speaker 4
Talk about careless. I should have anticipated something like this. Hey! Watch

Speaker 6
where

Speaker 7
you're touching!

Speaker 6
I can't help

Speaker 9
it! Hmm. So, do you have a boyfriend right now?

Speaker 4
I don't think that's any of your business, is it?

Speaker 9
I'm hurt. Ow. So, I understand that you're living with Katsuragi.

Speaker 4
Uh, yeah?

Speaker 9
Tell me something. Is she still so wild in bed? What?

Speaker 4
What? What? What are you

Speaker 10
implying by that?

Speaker 9
No, she hasn't changed at all, has she, Shinji?

Speaker 10
Um, I guess. But how did you know what my name was?

Speaker 9
Well, I ought to know you. You're pretty famous in the defense business, you know. The famous third child who piloted an Eva in his first battle with no training. Oh, that.

Speaker 4
I was just lucky.

Speaker 9
Luck is a part of your destiny. It's your talent. Well, I'll see you later.

Speaker 7
Okay. It's a bad dream. It's a nightmare.

Speaker 9
So, what do you think about Shinji Ikari?

Speaker 7
Oh, the great third child. He's boring.

Speaker 9
And yet, his synchronization ratio was well over 40% in combat with no prior training. My God! That admiral's attitude gets on my nerves.

Speaker 4
He's full of himself, all right. Too much pride's bound to make him cynical. That Mr. Kaji is pretty, um,

Speaker 9
interesting.

Speaker 7
He hasn't changed at all, that chauvinistic pig! Hey, third child. You're coming with me.

Speaker 7
*Squeak* That's really an interesting color. I didn't know it was red. That's not all that's different about Unit 2. Uh-huh. Unit 0 and 1 were the prototype and test type respectively. The fact that Unit 1 synchronized with an untrained pilot like you is proof of that. However, Unit 2 is a little different. My Unit 2 is the world's first real Evangelion! Created for actual combat conditions, it's the final production model! What

Speaker 6
was that? An explosion? Undersea shockwave!

Speaker 7
And it sounded close! Look! What's that? It can't be... angels! Angels? You mean a real one? This is really bad. We've got to go back and find Misato. Oondava.

Speaker 8
All ships, head out and take evasive actions. Radio room, status report. The silver lanes got silent. Titus Andronicus can't locate the target. The Biloxi Blues is taking in

Speaker 4
water. Damn

Speaker 1
it

Speaker 8
all. What the hell is going on?

Speaker 4
Hello, nerve delivery. Would you like to order data on this enemy and countermeasures to use against it?

Speaker 11
This is a combat situation. Get the hell off my bridge!

Speaker 4
This is just my opinion, but I'd say that must be an angel. All ships, fire at will! It's pointless.

Speaker 9
An AT field can't be penetrated with this kind of firepower.

Speaker 4
But what is this angel doing here? Is it after Unit 2? *Mumbling*

Speaker 7
Mom, I'm schnell!

Speaker 1
Where are you taking me?

Speaker 7
Just wait here a second.

Speaker 1
I don't believe this.

Speaker 7
Get back! Don't laugh, you deviant! Why do all boys have to be such a bunch of perverted jerks? Perversa idioten! Ugh!

Speaker 10
Let's go, Asuka.

Speaker 5
Why won't it sink? Only an Ava can beat it. What?! Something...

Speaker 6
Well,

Speaker 7
put it on! Uh... Don't stand there! Get moving! Okay, but what do we need these flight suits for, Asuka? Are you dense? We're going to defeat that angel with my unit, too! No way! Does Misato know about this? I'll get her permission after the fact. There, get ready for an amazing display of piloting, third child. Just sit down and don't bug me.

Speaker 4
This is odd. The Angel seems to be looking for something.

Speaker 2
I wasn't expecting to see an Angel. This isn't how it's supposed to be. That's why Unit 2 is there. And I've generously provided a second pilot as a reserve. If worse comes to worst, you can always escape by yourself.

Speaker 9
Of course I can.

Speaker 7
Erzähl, Einlass. Anfang der Bewegung, bestätigt. Anfang des Nervenanschlusses, bestätigt. Anfang nächste der Herzmonitor, bestätigt. Syncro start, nun! It's a program error! It's thought noise! I told you not to disturb me! What do you mean? You're thinking in Japanese, aren't you? If you must think, do it in German! Uh, well, I'll try. Uh, Strudel? Brotwurst?

Speaker 6
Don't go off! Never

Speaker 7
mind! We'll start over again. Switch language to Japanese. Evangelion, Unit 2, go!

Speaker 11
Communication from the Othello! Ava Unit 2 is activating! Say

Speaker 4
what? Alright, Asuka!

Speaker 11
Abort! Stop the Ava activation sequence!

Speaker 4
Don't listen to that moron, Asuka! Go for it! What are you doing?

Speaker 11
That A-line is put around my jurisdiction! You're violating my authority!

Speaker 4
Who gives a damn about your procedures? This is an emergency! I'll

Speaker 11
have you all-- Oh, dear lord.

Speaker 8
Unit 2 is still using the B-type equipment. What?

Speaker 4
If we fall into the ocean, we're done for.

Speaker 7
Then

Speaker 4
we won't do that. Shinji, are you in there too? Yes, ma'am. Hi!

Speaker 11
They're just kids!

Speaker 4
This is our chance, right-- Asuka, take off!

Speaker 7
Go! Let's do it. Where is it? That way! We've got just 58 seconds left. I'm well aware of that. Misato, get the external power supply socket onto the flight deck. I'm on it!

Speaker 11
What's she doing now?

Speaker 7
Right, let's play hopscotch. Hopscotch?

Speaker 3
The power supply is in place.

Speaker 4
Reactor connection completed.

Speaker 11
All hands, prepare for impact. This is nuts!

Speaker 7
Ava Unit 2 coming in for landing!

Speaker 3
Oh, what a waste! The target

Speaker 7
is approaching rapidly! Angel! Approaching from 9 o'clock! Switching to external power! Switch completed! We don't have any guns! The progressive knife ought to do it! *BANG

Speaker 4
*

Speaker 11
Looking good, Oscar! This isn't a game! Look what you're doing on my flight deck!

Speaker 6
Look!

Speaker 7
It's sinking! Oscar, it's impossible to fight underwater using the B-type equipment! Well, you know what they always say: You don't know until you try.

Speaker 4
Oh, man. How much cable is left?

Speaker 8
1,200 meters. What are you going to do?

Speaker 4
We'll deal with it. We've got to do something. The cable's about to run out!

Speaker 3
Get brace for the shock! Vedant! Ava has lost the target! I've got to change the disc! A Yak-38 costume! Hey, Katsuragi! Kaji!

Speaker 9
I've got to make a delivery, so I'll just be taking off. Well, let's go.

Speaker 3
Take care of the rest of this, Captain. There!

Speaker 7
He ran away.

Speaker 3
Admiral, the target is approaching Ava again.

Speaker 7
Here it comes again. Right, I'll finish it off this time. Hey, what's wrong? It's not working. It's B-type equipment. What are you gonna do? What am

Speaker 6
I?

Speaker 7
You're the famous third child, aren't you? Do something! Look! Steve! It's an

Speaker 3
angel.

Speaker 3
Ava too has entered the target's body! Does that mean that Ava's been eaten? This is like Marlon fishing.

Speaker 4
Fishing?

Speaker 7
That's it! Fishing! Oh man, it just goes from bad to worse! Oh shut up you pessimist! And

Speaker 6
get off my lap, you

Speaker 7
pervert! But we've got to free ourselves!

Speaker 4
Asuka, do you read me? Don't let that

Speaker 7
angel get away! Huh?

Speaker 4
Well, Admiral? What

Speaker 5
now? I'm

Speaker 4
going to need your cooperation.

Speaker 5
A point-blank assault by the two surviving battleships?

Speaker 4
Correct. We'll sink these two evacuated battleships in line with the umbilical cable as a trap. When the Ava opens the angel's mouth, both ships will rush into the opening. Once inside the angel, the ship's computers will be activated via remote control. They will then fire all of their bow turret cannons and self-destruct, destroying the target. Preposterous! Preposterous, perhaps, but not completely impossible.

Speaker 5
I understand.

Speaker 3
All hands abandon ship! I repeat, all hands abandon ship!

Speaker 5
What about the Evangelion?

Speaker 4
Don't worry about them. They'll be perfectly fine.

Speaker 7
- Hey, don't out-break my aim without my

Speaker 4
permission! Shinji, Asuka, do you understand the operation? I'll do the best job I can!

Speaker 1
All ships,

Speaker 4
open the Kingston valve. Scuttle at point Z. Reverse the cable!

Speaker 3
- Ava is started to service! T-Money 7 need to contact!

Speaker 7
Hey, are you rubbing against me on purpose? Cut it out, dork! Will you quit complaining? We've got to open its mouth or we'll be fish food. T

Speaker 3
-minus 60 to contact.

Speaker 1
How's its mouth? It's still not

Speaker 3
open.

Speaker 1
Both battleships are sinking towards the target. Ava continues to serve us. T-minus 50 to contact.

Speaker 7
It's stuck. There's no time left. - Ah! - Ah! - Ah! - Ah! -

Speaker 4
- Target has passed beneath the tempest. - There's

Speaker 7
no time left. - Do it! - Now don't get any strange ideas. - Like what? - Let's just concentrate on getting out of here.

Speaker 4
- Works for

Speaker 1
me!

Speaker 3
- T minus 20 to contact.

Speaker 6
- Ah!

Speaker 3
- Ah! - Ah! - T minus 15 to

Speaker 1
contact. Open, open, open, open, open, open!

Fire! *Evil Scream

Speaker 4
Cut it out.

Speaker 3
At least we collected a lot of valuable data. I see.

Speaker 6
Hmm.

Speaker 3
Misato. Huh? This data really is important. Oh. Whoa!

Speaker 4
Nice figure! They broke their synchronization ratio records. Just for seven seconds. It must have been due to the danger.

Speaker 7
Wait! Wait!

Speaker 4
Hey! Where's Kaji? Gee, he took a powder. He's probably back at the headquarters by now, that

Speaker 9
jerk! My goodness, that was a rather eventful trip, wasn't it? Was it caused by this? I wonder. Well, it's already restored itself this far. It's frozen, but it's still alive. Quite amazing. This is the Keystone of Human Instrumentality Project, isn't it?

Speaker 2
Correct. This is the first human being. This is Adam. She may have looked

Speaker 9
cute, but she was a real female dog, if you know what I mean.

Speaker 3
Well, at least we won't have to see her again.

Speaker 9
Yeah, but Mr. Big Shot here still gotta go work with her every day. I feel sorry for him.

Speaker 6
Huh? Look!

Speaker 7
I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh?

Speaker 10
In other words, darling kiss me Fill my heart with song and let me sing forever more You are all I long for all I worship and adore In other words, please be true. In other words,

Speaker 4
I love you. I love you. When a disastrous battle proves that Asuka and Shinji need to work on their ability to function as a team, Misato comes up with a plan to make their dysfunctions functional. Drama ensues in the next exciting episode. And of course, there'll be lots of

Speaker 6
fan service. Don't miss it.
