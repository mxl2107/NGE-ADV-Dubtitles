1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,100
Speaker 1: Like a poor man,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,540
Speaker 1: You're a young man,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Speaker 1: You're a fairy tale.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,160
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: Even if you're a door, you're smiling

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,120
Speaker 1: I'm so happy that you're looking for a moment

7
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,420
Speaker 1: I'm still wondering if you're not sure

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,440
Speaker 1: 痛いけな瞳

9
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,900
Speaker 1: だけどいつか気づくでしょう その背中には

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,360
Speaker 1: 遥か未来目指すための羽があること

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,360
Speaker 1: 残酷な天使のテゼ 窓辺からやがて飛び立つ

12
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,840
Speaker 1: Hottobashiru atui pattosude

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,580
Speaker 1: Omoyde wo uragiru nara

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,320
Speaker 1: Kono sora wo daite kagayaku

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
Speaker 1: Shounenmu yoshi uwa ni nare

16
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 2: Hey, have you seen her yet?

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,380
Speaker 3: Oh yeah! Yeah!

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,360
Speaker 2: Seen what?

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,380
Speaker 2: You dork! You

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,840
Speaker 3: haven't seen the overseas student yet?

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,380
Speaker 2: The overseas student? A foreigner?

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:38,840
Speaker 2: Yeah!

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,260
Speaker 3: She's in the 8th grade, Class A! She just transferred here!

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,880
Speaker 2: Oh,

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,780
Speaker 4: she's hot!

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,700
Speaker 4: Her name's Asuka Langley Soryu. Did you know that?

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
Speaker 4: Yeah, she's just cute.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,640
Speaker 5: Since she was raised over there but born here, do you think she'll already have a boyfriend?

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,860
Speaker 4: No, no, no.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,640
Speaker 6: I

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,840
Speaker 4: bet

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,860
Speaker 5: she broke up in Germany

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,320
Speaker 4: and she's here in a foreign land with a heart that can't be mended.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,620
Speaker 4: All right.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,860
Speaker 6: My gosh. Did you hear all that gossip? Asuka, Asuka, Asuka.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,780
Speaker 2: They're totally clueless.

37
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,620
Speaker 6: Thanks. Come again.

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 2: At least your pictures don't reveal her personality.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,800
Speaker 5: Hello.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Speaker 5: Guten Morgen.

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,600
Speaker 5: - Good Shinji!

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Speaker 5: - G-Guten

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Speaker 7: Morgan.

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,680
Speaker 7: - Hey,

45
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,640
Speaker 8: why so

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,280
Speaker 5: gloomy?

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,680
Speaker 5: I'm the most popular girl in school.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,060
Speaker 5: You should appreciate your good fortune.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,500
Speaker 5: - Gah!

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,380
Speaker 5: - Hey, the other one's here too, isn't she?

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,300
Speaker 5: - Other one?

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,860
Speaker 5: - What are you stupid?

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,980
Speaker 5: I'm talking about the first child, of course.

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
Speaker 1: - Oh, Ayanami.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,360
- Hm?

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,440
Speaker 5: Hello!

57
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,120
Speaker 5: You must be Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the prototype.

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,720
Speaker 5: I'm Asuka!

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,620
Speaker 5: Asuka Langley Soryu!

60
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,720
Speaker 5: I'm the designated pilot of Ava 2.

61
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,020
Speaker 5: Let's be good friends!

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,400
Speaker 5: What for?

63
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,300
Speaker 5: Because it would be convenient!

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,880
Speaker 5: You know what I mean!

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,040
Speaker 5: If I'm ordered to, I will do it.

66
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,040
Speaker 5: Freakazoid.

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,860
Speaker 2: It takes one to know one.

68
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,500
Speaker 2: I wonder if only weirdos are chosen to be Eva pilots.

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,120
Speaker 4: Oh!

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,700
Speaker 4: You've lost some weight.

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,560
Speaker 4: You're enduring an unrequited love.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,900
Speaker 9: Really? You're so very sure, are you?

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,860
Speaker 4: A woman with a mole like a tear on her cheek is destined to a life full of heartache and sorrow.

74
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,080
Speaker 9: If you're trying to put the moves on me, I'm afraid you can't.

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 9: Not while that face is pressed against the

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,880
Speaker 4: glass anyway.

77
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,040
Speaker 10: It's been quite a while, Kashi.

78
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,840
Speaker 4: It's been a while, all right.

79
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,500
Speaker 10: You know, you're not as discreet as I remember you.

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,700
Speaker 10: He ain't never been discreet in his life.

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,280
Speaker 10: You finished handing over Unit 2, haven't you?

82
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,080
Speaker 10: What are you still doing here?

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,880
Speaker 4: I received orders this morning that I'll be staying around so, Gorgeous, we can hang around again.

84
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,380
Speaker 10: Just like we used to.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,880
Speaker 10: Don't flatter yourself.

86
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,020
Speaker 10: Enemy attack?

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,740
Speaker 11: We've just received this report from the battlecruiser Haruna.

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,720
Speaker 11: Have detected huge submerged object off the Kyi Peninsula.

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,080
Speaker 1: Sending data.

90
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,800
Speaker 11: Got it. The data has been analyzed.

91
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,700
Speaker 11: The wavelength pattern confirms it. It's an angel.

92
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,980
Speaker 11: All personnel, go to first stage alert.

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,300
Speaker 11: 50

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,680
Speaker 10: %

95
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,760
Speaker 10: The recent battle has severely damaged Tokyo 3's intercept system.

96
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,300
Speaker 10: Only 26% of our defense capability has been restored.

97
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,000
Speaker 10: In addition, our operational capability for actual combat is virtually nil.

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,860
Speaker 10: Therefore, we're going to have to intercept the target at the water's edge right before it makes land.

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,780
Speaker 10: Units 1 and 2 will mount a coordinated attack in a series of waves.

100
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,300
Speaker 10: In other words, close in and take turns.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:07,900
Speaker 10: Roger!

102
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Speaker 10: This

103
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Speaker 5: sucks! My first fight over Japan and she won't let me handle it solo! Why do I have to bring you?

104
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,300
Speaker 1: SOP! That's just procedures, you know!

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,380
Speaker 1: Well, let

106
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,040
Speaker 5: me tell you something first, third child! Just don't get in my way!

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,460
Speaker 5: Hmm, his selection as a pilot must have been a joke, right?

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
Speaker 5: *BANG*

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,460
Speaker 7: Beginning attack!

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,260
Speaker 5: I'll handle this angel!

111
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,820
Speaker 5: Cover my back, Shinji!

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Speaker 5: C-Cover you?

113
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,380
Speaker 5: Yeah!

114
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,580
Speaker 5: Ladies first!

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,040
Speaker 5: Dammit!

116
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,200
Speaker 5: Don't you talk to me like that, you dumb rookie!

117
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,240
Speaker 7: In charge!

118
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,760
Speaker 7: What?

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,440
*Squeak

120
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,580
Speaker 12: *BANG

121
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,440
Speaker 8: *

122
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,440
Speaker 8: This is all your fault! You totally screwed up my debut battle!

123
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,940
Speaker 5: What are you talking about? You're the one who charged in there acting like an idiot.

124
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:25,020
Speaker 5: Idiot?

125
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,480
Speaker 8: How dare you call me that, you pathetic excuse for a combat pilot! You're just a jerk!

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Speaker 8: Me?

127
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,620
Speaker 3: You were in such a rush to show off, you disregarded procedure.

128
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,760
Speaker 5: What was that? You look like a drowned rat!

129
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,700
Speaker 5: You can't say that

130
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,460
Speaker 12: kind of thing to me!

131
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,080
Speaker 12: Nerve abandoning operation and transferred command to UN Secondary Force.

132
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,540
Speaker 11: We've been completely humiliated.

133
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,620
Speaker 12: At 11:05 AM, the UN forces made an attack with an in-tomb mine.

134
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,440
Speaker 11: We'll have to redraw the map again.

135
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:50,840
Speaker 11: They

136
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,940
Speaker 12: succeeded in burning off 28% of the target's structural substance.

137
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,280
Speaker 5: Well, it kinda looks dead.

138
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Speaker 11: This is merely temporary. The second attack is just a matter of time.

139
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,840
Speaker 11: Well, at least

140
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Speaker 4: we've got time to regroup, and you can't ask for more than that.

141
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,180
Speaker 4: Alright,

142
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,960
Speaker 11: you two. Just what do you think your job is?

143
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,740
Speaker 5: Piloting Ava?

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,240
Speaker 5: Wrong!

145
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,720
Speaker 11: It's to beat the Angels!

146
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,560
Speaker 11: Nerve does not exist to make grotesque public spectacles like this.

147
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,240
Speaker 11: Therefore, the two of you will learn to work together.

148
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,760
Speaker 5: Why should we?

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,760
Speaker 11: Enough.

150
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,360
Speaker 5: Why does everyone get so angry here?

151
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,280
Speaker 4: Adults have a thing about credibility.

152
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,580
Speaker 5: Um, where's

153
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,100
Speaker 9: Misato?

154
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,200
Speaker 4: Clearing things up.

155
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,060
Speaker 4: It's the duty of the person in charge to take responsibility for anything that goes wrong.

156
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,700
Speaker 9: Oh, look what we have here.

157
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,460
Speaker 9: Here are the protests and damage reports from all of the bureaus concerned.

158
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker 9: This is a bill from the UN, and you've got a complaint from public relations as well.

159
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,460
Speaker 9: I hope you have fun reading them all.

160
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,760
Speaker 10: I already know what they say.

161
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,880
Speaker 10: If you're going to fight, please don't do it here, right?

162
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,200
Speaker 10: I'd say that was a good guess.

163
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,340
Speaker 10: I'll do it after we kill this angel. I will destroy it.

164
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Speaker 10: That would be a nice start.

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,620
Speaker 10: I think you should know that Commander Foyutsuki isn't exactly happy with this whole situation.

166
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,200
Speaker 10: I'm afraid you could be busted back to lieutenant or even lower.

167
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,720
Speaker 10: I guess it was just good luck within bad luck that Commander Ikari wasn't here.

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,960
Speaker 10: If he'd been here, you'd have already been fired.

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Speaker 10: So you've brought me some ideas to help save my job, haven't you, dear friend?

170
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,240
Speaker 10: Like this one?

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Speaker 10: Ah, I thank you, Dr. Ritsugu Akagi.

172
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,680
Speaker 10: It's good to have a friend you can count on.

173
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,840
Speaker 10: That's nice.

174
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,720
Speaker 10: But I'm not the one who'll be saving your backside this time.

175
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,840
Speaker 10: This is Mr. Kaji's idea.

176
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,780
Speaker 10: Kaji?

177
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:32,360
Speaker 10: Hmm.

178
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,600
Speaker 10: Hmm.

179
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,500
Speaker 1: I'm home!

180
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,220
Speaker 1: Not that anyone's here, of course, but...

181
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,580
Speaker 1: WHAT?!

182
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,080
Speaker 1: What is this?!

183
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,240
Speaker 5: Don't be so

184
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,560
Speaker 1: rude!

185
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,400
Speaker 1: These are my personal belongings!

186
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,040
Speaker 1: You?!

187
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,180
Speaker 1: Wh-but-but

188
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,720
Speaker 5: what in the

189
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,300
Speaker 7: blazes are you doing in my house?!

190
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,500
Speaker 7: Why

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,680
Speaker 5: are you still here?

192
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,900
Speaker 7: Still here?!

193
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,300
Speaker 5: Don't Hmm,

194
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,540
Speaker 5: yeah, you've been dumped for the new model.

195
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,320
Speaker 7: Huh?!

196
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,540
Speaker 7: Misato

197
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
Speaker 7: will be living with

198
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,180
Speaker 5: me. Of course,

199
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,560
Speaker 5: that's a much more logical choice when you consider my superior abilities.

200
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,500
Speaker 5: Although honestly, I'd rather live with Kaji.

201
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,940
Speaker 5: Say, just why our Japanese houses so small anyway?

202
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,760
Speaker 5: I couldn't even get half my stuff in my new room!

203
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,000
Speaker 1: And Japanese sure

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
Speaker 5: don't have any sense of privacy.

205
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,800
Speaker 5: How can they live in a

206
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,820
Speaker 10: room without locks?

207
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,780
Speaker 10: Unbelievable!

208
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,380
Speaker 5: It's weird.

209
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,840
Speaker 5: The Japanese way is to consider

210
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 10: the needs of others before one's own.

211
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,020
Speaker 5: Misawa!

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,980
Speaker 10: How's it going?

213
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,360
Speaker 10: You two are going to get along real well.

214
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,600
Speaker 7: - What? - Just what do you mean?

215
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,300
Speaker 10: - This is part of your new training.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,620
Speaker 10: - Say what?

217
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,780
Speaker 10: - There is only one way to destroy the seventh angel.

218
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Speaker 10: Execute a simultaneous two point attack

219
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,760
Speaker 10: on each target's core while the angel is separated.

220
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Speaker 10: In other words, an attack on both halves by two Avas

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,120
Speaker 10: with perfectly synchronized timing.

222
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,860
Speaker 10: Coordination between the two of you

223
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Speaker 10: will be vital to the success of the mission.

224
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,160
Speaker 10: To that end, I want the two of you

225
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,800
Speaker 10: to live together from now on.

226
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,600
Speaker 10: No way! A boy and a girl should never sleep under one roof after the age of seven!

227
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,000
Speaker 10: The angel is currently regenerating itself. It will begin its second assault in six

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,200
Speaker 8: days.

229
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,920
Speaker 8: But it's impossible.

230
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Speaker 10: We have a way of making it possible.

231
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,980
Speaker 10: The master attack pattern will be choreographed using this music.

232
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,940
Speaker 10: If you follow

233
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,140
Speaker 7: it

234
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,780
Speaker 10: exactly, you will be able to work in sync and completely destroy both targets.

235
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,100
Speaker 10: We begin now.

236
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,860
Speaker 7: We attack in six days.

237
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,420
Speaker 10: Hmph!

238
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,100
Speaker 12: - Coming.

239
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,960
Speaker 6: - You betrayed us.

240
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,220
Speaker 6: You're dressing alike again too.

241
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,520
Speaker 6: - I can't believe this.

242
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Speaker 7: - Neither can we.

243
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,420
Speaker 6: It's all Misada's fault.

244
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,280
Speaker 6: We have to eat, breathe, and sleep together.

245
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,880
Speaker 7: - You're living in sin,

246
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,300
Speaker 8: that's

247
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,760
Speaker 7: awful.

248
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,140
Speaker 7: - No, it's not like that.

249
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:34,980
Speaker 7: - Just

250
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,240
Speaker 8: what is it like?

251
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,960
Speaker 8: - Hi everybody.

252
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:37,780
Speaker 2: - Huh?

253
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Speaker 2: - Um, would you like to explain all of this to us?

254
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,440
Speaker 2: - Geez, Shinji, you should've told us

255
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,340
Speaker 2: about that part first.

256
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,680
Speaker 2: - So how

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,700
Speaker 10: are their coordination drills

258
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,020
Speaker 10: coming along, Miss Misato?

259
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,080
Speaker 10: - Not very well, as you can see.

260
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,620
Speaker 10: - Scheisse!

261
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,860
Speaker 10: - You will so

262
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,840
Speaker 5: much for synchronization,

263
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,560
Speaker 5: I can never sink down the pathetic level

264
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,740
Speaker 5: this animated turnip

265
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,260
Speaker 8: lives at.

266
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Speaker 8: If you ask me,

267
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,180
Speaker 5: the whole idea

268
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,800
Speaker 8: is impossible.

269
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,000
Speaker 5: - Then you're giving up.

270
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,740
Speaker 5: But you don't have anyone else, do you?

271
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,400
Speaker 5: - Rei? - Yes, ma'am.

272
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,800
Speaker 5: Why

273
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,480
Speaker 10: don't you try?

274
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,520
Speaker 10: Yes, ma'am.

275
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,080
Speaker 10: Well, it looks like I should alter the operation

276
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,460
Speaker 10: to pair Shinji and Rei.

277
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,200
Speaker 10: What?

278
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,700
Speaker 13: No.

279
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 13: No!

280
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,720
Speaker 13: No, I can't stand this!

281
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
Speaker 13: I can't take it anymore!

282
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Speaker 13: Wait, Asuka!

283
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,160
Speaker 2: So even the devil can cry.

284
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,320
Speaker 13: Uuuh! Shinji-kou!

285
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,040
Speaker 13: Go apologize!

286
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:48,980
Speaker 13: Huh?

287
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,680
Speaker 13: You made her cry, you jerk! Go find her and tell her you're sorry!

288
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Speaker 5: Um...

289
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Speaker 5: Don't say anything.

290
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,440
Speaker 5: I know. I have to pilot the Eva. I've got no choice.

291
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
Speaker 5: I'll do it.

292
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,460
Speaker 5: No matter what, I'll put Ray and Misato to shame!

293
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Speaker 5: But still, you don't have to squash them.

294
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,400
Speaker 5: You're being too simplistic, even if you are a male.

295
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,420
Speaker 5: I must avenge myself. My pride.

296
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,580
Speaker 5: It's a matter of honor now. Can't you understand that?

297
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,440
Speaker 5: Where's Misato?

298
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,760
Speaker 5: At work.

299
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,420
Speaker 3: She called earlier.

300
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,760
Speaker 3: She'll be there all night.

301
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,220
Speaker 5: So, that means we're all alone tonight, huh?

302
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,320
Speaker 5: This is the impenetrable wall of Jericho, third child.

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,160
Speaker 5: What?

304
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,300
Speaker 5: Take one step over this wall and you'll be a dead man.

305
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,620
Speaker 5: And now it's time to go to bed, children.

306
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,000
Speaker 5: Ugh!

307
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,320
Speaker 8: Why do Japanese sleep on the floor? This is so stupid!

308
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,140
*Gunshot*

309
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,140
Speaker 7: Oh, my God.

310
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Speaker 7: Oh, no.

311
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,540
Speaker 10: You're just a child yourself.

312
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,339
Speaker 10: No, somebody might see us.

313
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,000
Speaker 4: Who's watching?

314
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,160
Speaker 10: Somebody--

315
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,900
Speaker 10: Forget it, Kashi.

316
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,720
Speaker 10: There's nothing between us anymore.

317
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,300
Speaker 10: Don't ever do that again.

318
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,820
Speaker 4: But your lips didn't say no.

319
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,180
Speaker 4: Tell me, which one should I trust?

320
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,960
Speaker 4: Your lips or your words?

321
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,600
Speaker 9: Oh, thanks.

322
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,860
Speaker 9: Well, looks like you've got troubles.

323
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:22,800
Speaker 10: Hmm?

324
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,620
Speaker 10: Yeah, a few.

325
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,480
Speaker 10: So,

326
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,420
Speaker 9: is it work, or a man, or both?

327
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,380
Speaker 10: A lot of things.

328
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:29,980
Speaker 9: Hmm.

329
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
Speaker 10: Still in love, huh?

330
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,020
Speaker 10: Don't be ridiculous!

331
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,220
Speaker 10: Get real.

332
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,260
Speaker 10: Who'd want that idiot?

333
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,880
Speaker 10: I may have been just a kid,

334
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,000
Speaker 10: but getting involved with him was still the stupidest

335
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,260
Speaker 10: and most idiotic thing I've ever done in my entire life.

336
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,120
Speaker 10: I meant that he may still like you.

337
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,240
Speaker 10: Did I scare you?

338
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,780
Speaker 10: I'll

339
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,760
Speaker 9: show you scary.

340
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,440
Speaker 9: You're only proving my hypothesis.

341
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,620
Speaker 9: Why don't you just go with your feelings, Misato?

342
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,560
Speaker 9: It's not like it's still eight years ago, you know.

343
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,840
Speaker 9: Nothing's changed.

344
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,680
Speaker 10: Not a bit.

345
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,340
Speaker 10: He's still immature.

346
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,400
Speaker 10: I've got to get to work.

347
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,680
Speaker 10: Tomorrow's D-Day, you know.

348
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,020
Speaker 6: The target has broken through the final defense line at Gora.

349
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Speaker 10: Here it comes. We won't fail this time.

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,000
Speaker 10: Spread your AT fields as soon as the music starts.

351
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:29,920
Speaker 10: Then

352
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,240
Speaker 5: follow the operation choreography. Are you two ready? Roger!

353
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
Speaker 2: The target has entered the mountains.

354
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,080
Speaker 5: Just remember the moves, Shinji. Full power, maximum performance.

355
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,040
Speaker 5: I know that. We'll be finished in 62 seconds.

356
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,480
Speaker 2: It's coming. Target entering ground zero.

357
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,280
Speaker 10: Detach external power.

358
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,300
Speaker 10: Ava, launch.

359
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,160
Speaker 12: *Squeak*

360
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,120
Speaker 12: Huh?

361
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,000
Speaker 12: Both Avas are okay.

362
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
Speaker 12: Ah, jeez!

363
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,300
Speaker 12: Pathetic.

364
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 7: *Scream*

365
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,759
Speaker 5: What are you doing on my Unit 2?!

366
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,660
Speaker 5: What are you talking about? You're the one who fell on me!

367
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,560
Speaker 5: You're the one who lost time first!

368
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,040
Speaker 5: Doom Cop! You're always so slow!

369
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,480
Speaker 5: What were you doing staying up so late last night?

370
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,680
Speaker 3: Image training for

371
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,440
Speaker 10: today's battle!

372
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:30,940
Speaker 10: Oh,

373
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,820
Speaker 5: image training? I just bet!

374
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,300
Speaker 5: Liar! I know you

375
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Speaker 7: tried to kiss me while I

376
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,820
Speaker 5: was sleeping!

377
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
Speaker 5: You cheat! You were awake!

378
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,060
Speaker 5: Oh my gosh! I was just kidding! Did you really kiss me?

379
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,760
Speaker 5: Oh!

380
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,040
Speaker 3: No! No! No! I didn't! I stopped!

381
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,080
Speaker 5: Haventimate!

382
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:47,900
Speaker 5: I

383
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,120
Speaker 3: can't

384
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,720
Speaker 5: believe it!

385
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,120
Speaker 5: Is you calling for your mother in

386
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,140
your sleep and sleepwalking that caused her?

387
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,400
What kind of person?

388
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
Speaker 11: Those darn kids are embarrassing us again.

389
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:56,860
Speaker 11: Yeah.

390
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,520

Feel my heart's weak soul

393
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,380
And let it sit forevermore

394
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,340
You are all I know

395
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,480
For all I want is at the door

396
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,140
And now I want

397
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,759
Let me do

398
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,360
In the world

399
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,060
I love you

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,780
I love you

401

Speaker 14: When an unhatched angel is discovered in the caldera of the Osama volcano,

402
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,440
Speaker 14: especially equipped Ava must descend into the fires of hell itself to do battle.

403
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,700

404
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,440
