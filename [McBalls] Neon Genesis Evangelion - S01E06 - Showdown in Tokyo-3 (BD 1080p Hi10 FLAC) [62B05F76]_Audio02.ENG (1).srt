1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,720
Speaker 1: The old man like a poor man,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,540
Speaker 1: the young man,

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,640
Speaker 1: the story of the young man.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,180
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: Even if you're in the door, you're smiling and smiling.

6
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:44,500
Speaker 1: It's so easy to touch, but I'm not sure how to reach.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,440
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're still knowing.

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,380
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,340
Speaker 1: It's hard to see, right?

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,000
Speaker 1: The back of your back is a way to see the future.

11
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,460
Speaker 1: The hell of a god of the天使,

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,420
Speaker 1: I will soon fly away from the window.

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,400
Speaker 1: I will be able to fly with hot dogs,

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,480
Speaker 1: I will be afraid of the memories.

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,360
Speaker 1: I'm going to

16
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,960
Speaker 2: Retrieve it! Hurry!

17
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,600
Speaker 3: The target has gone silent!

18
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,980
Speaker 3: What's Shinji's status?

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,180
Speaker 2: He's alive!

20
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaker 4: Unit 1 has been recovered. Send him to the 7th cage.

21
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,120
Speaker 2: I'm going to the cage. Take over for me, please.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
Speaker 5: Unit 1 secured.

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,100
Speaker 5: The pilot's brainwaves are extremely erratic.

24
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,940
Speaker 5: His cardiac readings are very weak!

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Speaker 5: Increase the power to the life support systems.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Speaker 5: Give him a heart massage.

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,100
Speaker 5: Roger.

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,400
Speaker 5: Heartbeat stabilized.

29
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,880
Speaker 5: Force eject the

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Speaker 2: entry plug.

31
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:30,820
Speaker 2: Hurry!

32
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,200
Speaker 2: Emergency LCL discharge.

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:36,960
Speaker 2: Roger.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,820
Speaker 2: Come on, open the hatch.

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,400
Speaker 2: Come on!

36
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,060
Speaker 6: *Bang

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,460
*

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,660
*Evil*

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,040
Speaker 3: Its accelerated particle beam cannon has hit the balloon. The decoy's been vaporized.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Speaker 2: Next one.

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,200
*Squeak*

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,760
Speaker 3: The Type 12 Mortar has been vaporized!

43
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see that.

44
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,280
Speaker 3: From the data we've collected, we're assuming

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,260
Speaker 7: the Angel automatically attacks any opponents

46
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,480
Speaker 7: that come within a certain range.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Speaker 7: Hmmm...

48
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,840
Speaker 7: that range will be targeted.

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,080
Speaker 7: It's too risky for close range combat in an Ava, isn't it?

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,580
Speaker 2: What's the status of its AT field?

51
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Speaker 7: It's still active.

52
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,260
Speaker 7: It's strong enough that the spatial changes in phase are visible.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,660
Speaker 7: And needless to say, using conventional means of attack,

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,560
Speaker 7: guided missiles, artillery, and bombs

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,740
Speaker 7: would inflict more damage on us than on the Angel.

56
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,500
Speaker 2: Yeah,

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Speaker 7: offensively

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
Speaker 2: and defensively, it's almost perfect.

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,460
Speaker 2: A real flying fortress.

60
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,660
Speaker 2: What's the Angel's current location?

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,120
Speaker 8: At this moment, the target is directly above us,

62
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,900
Speaker 8: penetrating the Tokyo-3 null zone.

63
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,820
Speaker 8: A giant shield with a diameter of 17.5 meters

64
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,580
Speaker 7: is boring towards Nerve HQ.

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,420
Speaker 7: That's it then. It appears the enemy is going to attack Nerve headquarters directly.

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,940
Speaker 2: Sassy bastard! What's its estimated time of arrival?

67
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,780
Speaker 7: 6 minutes, 54 seconds AM,

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,820
Speaker 8: just after midnight.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,960
Speaker 8: By that time, it will have breached all 22 levels of defense armor,

70
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,600
Speaker 8: and will penetrate headquarters itself.

71
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,560
Speaker 2: Less than 10 hours.

72
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,440
Speaker 3: The shield has contacted the first armor plate.

73
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,460
Speaker 9: What kind of condition is Unit 1 in?

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,920
Speaker 9: Well, Unit 1's defensive armor was melted down to the third layer.

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,900
Speaker 9: But the good news is that the central control unit sustained no damage.

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
Speaker 9: Given three more seconds, it would have

77
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Speaker 4: shot right through the

78
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,220
Speaker 7: Ava.

79
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,000
Speaker 7: It'll take three hours to install replacement parts.

80
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,620
Speaker 4: Understood. What's Unit Zero's status?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,780
Speaker 4: The reactivation of Unit Zero shouldn't prove a problem,

82
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,740
Speaker 4: but there's still a feedback error remaining.

83
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,500
Speaker 4: So it wouldn't...

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,380
Speaker 4: Survive combat.

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,680
Speaker 4: What's the

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Speaker 2: condition of Unit One's pilot?

87
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,240
Speaker 7: No physical damage.

88
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,680
Speaker 7: However, nerve pulses are up by 0.8.

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,060
Speaker 7: That's still within the acceptable limits.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,240
Speaker 3: Enemy arrival, 9 hours, 55 minutes.

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,360
Speaker 2: Talk about high-pressure situations.

92
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,360
Speaker 7: Why don't we raise a white flag?

93
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,380
Speaker 2: Before we do that, there's just one more little thing that I'd like to try.

94
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,040
Speaker 3: You want to use a sniper to shoot the target from outside its firing zone?

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,660
Speaker 2: Yes, sir. Instead of trying to neutralize the target's AT field, I believe a pinpoint shot with a focused high-energy beam is the only way.

96
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,000
Speaker 5: What do the Magi say?

97
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,380
Speaker 5: The

98
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,200
Speaker 2: responses from the Magi supercomputers were two affirmative and one conditional affirmative.

99
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,000
Speaker 5: Our probability of success is

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,620
Speaker 7: 8.7%.

101
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,600
Speaker 2: It's the highest value we could get.

102
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,300
Speaker 2: I

103
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,480
Speaker 7: see no reason to reject your plan. You may proceed, Captain Katsuraki.

104
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,440
Speaker 9: Yes, sir.

105
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,700
Speaker 9: You know how crazy this whole operation is, don't you? Operations Director Katsuraki.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,280
Speaker 9: Don't

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,880
Speaker 2: be rude. It's not crazy. It can be done within nine hours and has the highest chance of success.

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,780
Speaker 9: It does? Really?

109
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,800
Speaker 9: But our positron rifle can't handle such a high output. What are you going to do about

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,080
Speaker 2: that?

111
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,600
Speaker 2: If ours won't work, we'll borrow one.

112
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,200
Speaker 9: We'll borrow one?

113
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,180
Speaker 2: You don't mean...

114
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,540
Speaker 2: Yeah, the SSDF's new prototype.

115
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:18,300
Speaker 2: I've come on behalf of NERV to hereby requisition the prototype self-propelled positron cannon as of 1500 hours today.

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,440
Speaker 10: But this is just... so ridiculous!

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,300
Speaker 2: We'll do our best to return this in as close to its original condition as we can.

118
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,100
Speaker 2: Thank you for your cooperation. Have a nice day.

119
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,620
Speaker 2: It's all yours, Ray! Take it away!

120
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,720
Speaker 2: What the?

121
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,740
Speaker 2: Be careful, that's a piece of precision machinery!

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,560
Speaker 2: Can I believe

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,340
Speaker 10: this? I cannot believe this.

124
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Speaker 7: But ma'am, our latest calculations show that it'll take at least 180 million kilowatts to penetrate that Angel's AT field.

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,280
Speaker 7: Just where exactly are you planning on getting that much electricity?

126
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,380
Speaker 2: Where do you think I'll get it? All over Japan!

127
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,200
Speaker 2: We apologize for interrupting our regular programming for this emergency bulletin.

128
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Speaker 2: From 11.30pm tonight until tomorrow morning, there will be a large-scale power blackout throughout most of Japan.

129
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,300
Speaker 2: We

130
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,380
Speaker 11: appreciate your cooperation.

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,160
Speaker 11: Repeat, from 11.30pm tonight until tomorrow morning, there will be a large-scale power blackout throughout most of Japan.

132
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,060
Speaker 11: We appreciate your cooperation.

133
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,480
Speaker 11: *Bell rings*

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
*Bell rings*

135
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,420
*Bell rings*

136
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,560
Speaker 10: The shield

137
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Speaker 11: has just broken

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,960
Speaker 2: through the seventh defensive layer.

139
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,120
Speaker 2: What's the status on the energy supply system?

140
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,260
Speaker 7: Um, we're running about 3.2% behind schedule, but we should be finished by 2310.

141
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,580
Speaker 2: And the positron rifle?

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Speaker 7: For the honor of Technology Development Department Section 3,

143
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,040
Speaker 8: we bet that we'll have it built in 3 hours!

144
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,920
Speaker 9: And how's our defense coming?

145
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,060
Speaker 9: Well, a shield is about the best we can come up with.

146
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,060
Speaker 9: So, is this the shield?

147
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,540
Speaker 9: Yes, it was sort of part of the space shuttle.

148
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,220
Speaker 9: It may look ugly, but it's got an electromagnetic base coating

149
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
Speaker 9: that Section 2 guarantees will stand up to the enemy's particle beam

150
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,540
Speaker 9: for at least 17 seconds.

151
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,400
Speaker 9: Pretty impressive, huh?

152
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,440
Speaker 9: Good work, Ritsuko.

153
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,440
Speaker 2: What about the sniper position?

154
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,800
Speaker 7: Taking geographical features and access to power transformers into consideration,

155
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,020
Speaker 7: this is our best choice.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,420
Speaker 2: Right, everything's looking good.

157
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,560
Speaker 2: Our sniper will attack from the top of Mount Futago.

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,360
Speaker 2: We will commence at zero hours tomorrow morning.

159
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Speaker 2: From this point on, this operation is called Operation Yashima!

160
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,680
Speaker 10: Roger.

161
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,740
Speaker 2: Now the only remaining problem is the pilot.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Speaker 12: Unit 1's pilot is conscious now. His examination results look normal.

163
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,460
Speaker 2: Good. Then the operation will proceed as planned.

164
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,200
Speaker 12: Roger.

165
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,460
Speaker 2: But I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

166
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,200
Speaker 12: Let's

167
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
Speaker 2: get to Mt. Vuntago now!

168
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,540
*phone rings*

169
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,200
*cough*

170
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,180
Speaker 13: *phone

171
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180
rings*

172
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,380
Speaker 13: Ayanami.

173
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,020
Speaker 13: Pilot Ikari, I've been sent here to brief you on the Operation Yashima timetables.

174
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,380
Speaker 13: The operation will begin at midnight zero hundred hours.

175
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,640
Speaker 13: Prior to that, pilots Ikari and Aionami will arrive at the cage by 17:30.

176
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,000
Speaker 13: At 1800, Unit 1 and Unit 0 will activate.

177
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,300
Speaker 13: At 18:05, both units will be deployed.

178
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,540
Speaker 13: They will arrive at the temporary base at Mount Futago at 18:30.

179
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
Speaker 13: There, they will await further orders.

180
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,580
Speaker 13: Here, this is a new one.

181
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,700
Speaker 13: Oh?

182
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,820
Speaker 13: Don't show up looking like that, Pilot

183
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,320
Speaker 14: Ikari.

184
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,120
Speaker 14: Oh...

185
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,640
Speaker 14: Oh!

186
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,320
Speaker 14: Sorry.

187
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,040
Speaker 14: I've been apologizing since yesterday.

188
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,240
Speaker 14: Your meal.

189
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,200
Speaker 13: I don't feel like eating anything.

190
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,120
Speaker 13: We will be departing in 60 minutes.

191
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,060
Speaker 14: Do I really have to pilot Ava again?

192
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,680
Speaker 14: Yes, you do.

193
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,140
Speaker 14: I don't want to!

194
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,780
Speaker 14: You can be so cool about it because you haven't had the kind of experiences I've had yet.

195
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,340
Speaker 14: I don't want to go through it again!

196
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,120
Speaker 14: Then you can just stay here

197
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Speaker 13: in bed.

198
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,780
Speaker 13: What do you mean by that?

199
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 13: I will pilot Eva Unit 1.

200
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,140
Speaker 13: Dr. Okagi is already prepared to rewrite the personal data files for Unit 1.

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,500
Speaker 13: Ritsuko is?

202
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,620
Speaker 13: Captain Katsuragi and Dr. Okagi will be waiting for me in the cage.

203
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:07,980
Speaker 13: Hey!

204
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,340
Speaker 13: Goodbye.

205
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,460
*Sigh*

206
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
Speaker 7: They're really late.

207
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,680
Speaker 3: We ought to evacuate to the shelter.

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,600
Speaker 3: No way! I hacked into my dad's data files!

209
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,400
Speaker 3: I'm absolutely sure this is the time it's said.

210
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,540
Speaker 3: Well, okay then. Where in the heck are they?

211
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,260
Speaker 3: Oh!

212
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Speaker 3: The entire mountain is moving!

213
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,260
Speaker 3: There they are! The Evangelions!

214
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,900
Speaker 9: Totally awesome!

215
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,380
Speaker 6: Go

216
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,560
Speaker 10: for it, Evangelions!

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,100
Speaker 10: We believe in you!

218
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,060
Speaker 10: Go, we believe in you! Yeah!

219
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,980
Speaker 10: Go Evangelion! Yeah!

220
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,360
Speaker 3: The shield has penetrated through the 17th layer of armor.

221
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,040
Speaker 3: It will reach headquarters in 3 hours, 55 minutes.

222
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,880
Speaker 7: Power supply stations from Shikoko and Kyosho areas completed.

223
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,180
Speaker 2: Beginning test of each cooling system.

224
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,480
Speaker 9: That's a very delicate piece of machinery. Handle it carefully.

225
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,300
Speaker 9: This thing wasn't built for field operations.

226
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,860
Speaker 9: Will it really work?

227
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,160
Speaker 9: Point taken, but we have no choice. This was the most expedient way of achieving our goal.

228
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
Speaker 9: Are you sure it's safe to use?

229
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,420
Speaker 9: Theoretically, yes. However, we're not sure if the cannon barrel and accelerator will be able to handle the stress or not.

230
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,160
Speaker 9: This is the first time it's ever been fired with such a high power output behind it.

231
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,280
Speaker 9: Listen up. Here are the battle plans for the operation. Shinji.

232
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:57,700
Speaker 9: Yes?

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Speaker 9: Your Unit 1 will be the gunner.

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,060
Speaker 9: Right.

235
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,380
Speaker 9: Rei, you will cover him with Unit 0.

236
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,660
Speaker 9: Yes.

237
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,140
Speaker 9: The reason for this arrangement is because Shinji has a higher sync ratio with Unit 1,

238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,900
Speaker 9: and this operation will require an exceptionally high degree of precision.

239
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,340
Speaker 9: Since the positron beam will be influenced by the Earth's gravity, magnetic fields, and rotation,

240
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,240
Speaker 9: it will not fire in a straight line.

241
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,280
Speaker 9: You must remember to adjust for these deviations.

242
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,500
Speaker 9: You must penetrate the core precisely.

243
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,400
Speaker 9: But Ritsuka, I've never practiced with this before.

244
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,220
Speaker 9: Don't worry. Just do what the manual says.

245
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,480
Speaker 9: As soon as the indicators in the center converge, just pull the trigger.

246
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,380
Speaker 9: The computers will handle the rest.

247
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,900
Speaker 9: Also, be aware that before you can fire the rifle a second time,

248
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,180
Speaker 9: you will first have to wait for the unit to cool,

249
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,980
Speaker 9: then replace the fuses and reload.

250
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,160
Speaker 9: You've got to hit it the first time.

251
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,180
Speaker 9: What if I miss? Or the enemy shoots back?

252
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,860
Speaker 9: Shinji, don't even think about something like that.

253
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,640
Speaker 9: You've got to destroy the Angel with your first shot.

254
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
Speaker 14: So I have no choice.

255
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,420
Speaker 13: I... I'm just to defend Unit 1, is that correct?

256
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:02,940
Speaker 13: Yes.

257
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,120
Speaker 13: Understood.

258
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,420
Speaker 2: It's time. Get geared up.

259
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,720
Speaker 2: Right.

260
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,880
Speaker 14: Maybe this will be our last day alive.

261
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,260
Speaker 14: Why would you say something like that?

262
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,400
Speaker 13: You won't die.

263
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,040
Speaker 13: I'll be protecting you.

264
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,120
*music*

265
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,400
Speaker 14: Ayanami, just why do you pilot this thing?

266
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,500
Speaker 14: Because I'm bonded to it.

267
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,840
Speaker 14: You're bonded?

268
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,860
Speaker 13: Yes. It's a

269
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,260
Speaker 14: bond.

270
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,100
Speaker 14: You mean to my father?

271
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,760
Speaker 14: To all people.

272
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,980
Speaker 14: You're very strong, Rei.

273
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,860
Speaker 14: I have nothing else.

274
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,600
Speaker 14: What do you mean you have nothing else?

275
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,600
Speaker 14: It's time.

276
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,400
Speaker 13: Let's go.

277
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,460
Speaker 13: Goodbye, Shinji.

278
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,660
Speaker 11: The time is approaching zero hundred hours.

279
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:15,939
Speaker 7: Commencing operation.

280
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,740
Speaker 2: Listen, Shinji.

281
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,800
Speaker 2: We're entrusting you with the energy of the entire nation of Japan.

282
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,060
Speaker 2: I'm counting on you.

283
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,600
Speaker 7: Roger.

284
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,300
Speaker 2: Initiate primary connection. Do it!

285
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,800
Speaker 7: Initiating power transmission from districts numbers 1 through 803.

286
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,080
Speaker 11: Voltage is rising. Water exchange unit reaching pressure zone.

287
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,280
Speaker 7: All cooling systems operating on full power.

288
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,140
Speaker 11: Temperature's stable. No problem is detected.

289
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,340
Speaker 11: Roger. Positron charge is nominal.

290
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,020
Speaker 11: Initiate second connection.

291
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,100
Speaker 11: All accelerators are engaging.

292
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,020
Speaker 11: Activate the convergence unit now.

293
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,280
Speaker 8: Transmitting all power to Mount Futago, temporary substation.

294
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,760
Speaker 8: No problems reported with third connection.

295
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,940
Speaker 12: Release final safety systems.

296
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,760
Speaker 7: Release final safety lock.

297
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,160
Speaker 12: Air correction for Earth rotation and gravity is 0.0009.

298
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,760
Speaker 12: Voltage is 0.2 short of critical.

299
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,580
Speaker 6: Seventh

300
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,980
Speaker 5: and tenth connections engaged!

301
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,620
Speaker 5: Transmitting all energy to the positron rifle!

302
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,060
Speaker 5: Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

303
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,180
Speaker 6: four, no! Not again!

304
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,020
Speaker 10: Three, two, one!

305
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,040
Speaker 10: Fire now!

306
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,040
*Evil Scream

307
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,800
Speaker 3: The shield has broken into the geo front.

308
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,860
Speaker 5: - Hurry, second shot.

309
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,340
Speaker 5: - Replacing fuses, initiating recharge.

310
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,740
Speaker 5: - Barrel cooling in progress.

311
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,060
Speaker 5: - We've got another high energy reading building

312
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,820
Speaker 5: inside the target.

313
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,220
Speaker 4: - Not now.

314
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,220
Speaker 4: - Ah!

315
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:29,940
Speaker 4: - Look

316
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,120
Speaker 6: out,

317
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,680
Speaker 2: Shinji!

318
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,040
Speaker 2: - Ah!

319
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:33,620
Speaker 10: - Oh!

320
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,420
Speaker 5: - Ayunami!

321
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,160
Speaker 5: The shield can't last long!

322
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,000
Speaker 5: Are we ready?

323
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,060
Speaker 5: 10 more seconds!

324
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,920
Speaker 5: Arrgh!

325
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,140
Speaker 5: Hurry up!

326
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,680
Speaker 10: Hurry up!

327
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,560
Speaker 10: Arrgh!

328
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Speaker 10: Yeah! We made

329
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,380
Speaker 2: it!

330
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,020
Speaker 10: Ayanami!

331
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,740
