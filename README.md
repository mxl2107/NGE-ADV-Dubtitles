# NGE-ADV-Dubtitles
Hi All,

It would seem there is no ADV English dub subtitles, and in the 30 year history of the series, there has never been an attempt to create them, perhaps due to the need to live transcribe and attribute about 10.5 hours of audio.

HOWEVER! Thanks to AI, this becomes significantly easier.

The goal here is to generate English subtitles of the English ADV 1995 dub, AND ideally combine with existing subtitles of the Japanese written characters as well.

Therefore, please enjoy Episode 26 as a proof of concept for this workflow.

1. Obtain MKV files from Mcballs' T0rr3nts from (the sea of LCL).

2. Extract audio tracks using "Inviska MKV Extract". (I'm also going to extract "2D4U" 's song/signs subtitles.)

3. Batch convert outputted AC3 tiles to WAV with "Shutter Encoder" (because our AI transcriber doesn't do AC3).

4. "Speech to Text" using "Whisper." Free if you want one file at a time for TXT and SRT (subtitle filetype). $60 if you want to batch, and assign who is speaking.

IF YOU BUY PREMIUM

4A. Pick your favorite AI model. V3 gets Asuka's German decently? The "Speaker Recognition" works about half the time, so pick V2 if you prefer. I tried a few.

4B. Generate the proprietary "Whisper" file, so we can adjust who the speakers are and adjust a few words.

4C. Export as TXT and SRT.

(5?) Somehow combine with the "2D4U" subtitles
