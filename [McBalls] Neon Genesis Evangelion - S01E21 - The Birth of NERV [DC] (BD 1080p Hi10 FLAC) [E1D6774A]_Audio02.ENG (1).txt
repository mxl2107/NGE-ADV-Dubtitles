Speaker 1
You mean the super solenoid theory that Dr. Katsuragi proposed? That theory is outrageous and nothing more than a hypothesis at this

Speaker 2
point. But only

Speaker 1
the S2 theory can explain that giant's power. And we don't actually need to

Speaker 3
find this to

Speaker 1
put too much

Speaker 4
faith in their own ideas. When all the data has been verified, then I'll accept it. And they become fixated too easily. After all,

Speaker 3
they're incapable

Speaker 1
of accuracy

Speaker 3
-assessing reality.

Speaker 5
And those are the people seeking to find the

Speaker 4
truth of it. How is it quite? And in fact, they are not so noble. Discovery may be joy, but knowledge is power. All they're doing is trying to benefit themselves.

Speaker 2
Today's experiment is on an ego-friendly order to ignore that field, right? Right.

Speaker 6
We've got to suppress the surface radiation!

Speaker 2
It's way over

Speaker 6
the projected limit!

Speaker 2
It's no good! The DNA that was inserted

Speaker 6
into atoms has

Speaker 7
already been physically confused!

Speaker 3
All the heat fields are being released!

Speaker 1
The conversion system is already set! It's sinking in! I don't care if it just makes a small difference! Keep the damage to an absolute minimum! The atomic components are breaking up at the

Speaker 7
quad level! Initiate thermal damage treatment as soon as the dorm cough opens! I don't care if it's only for a tenth of a second! The

Speaker 8
conversion system is already being sold. God, how crazy! It's spinning its wings! It's breaking towards the sun!

Speaker 9
The End Like a cruel天使 A young man, be a fairy tale The blue wind is now on the door of my heart I'm just looking at you, You are smiling I am so happy to touch the touch I am so happy to be able to I don't know what you can't know I don't know what a smile But I will know that you will find your back The future will be the way to the future The endless endless endless endless The window from the end will be as soon as The hot air is on the hot air The memories of your dreams will be This sky will be the shining

Speaker 10
Hi! I'm not in right now, so leave your message after the beep. Bye-bye. My last assignment. It's red. Just like blood.

Speaker 11
Commander Fuyutsuki

Speaker 12
was abducted?

Speaker 13
That's right. It happened about two hours ago. The Vice Commander was last seen in the 8th District.

Speaker 12
That's inside this installation. What in the hell were you idiots and intelligence doing?

Speaker 13
Someone inside this organization must have been involved. We appreciate your cooperation in this.

Speaker 12
Someone who could outwit Section 2? You don't think--

Speaker 13
Ryoji Kaji. He's the suspected mastermind behind this plot.

Speaker 12
So that's why you came for me.

Speaker 13
We believe you can help us. As your colleagues, we regret the necessity of including the Director of Operations as a suspect. But that is the nature of our profession.

Speaker 11
And of course, considering my relationship with him, it's a natural precaution.

Speaker 13
Yes, your cooperation would be appreciated. It's been a while. Are your invitations always so violent, Chairman

Speaker 4
Gill? There are a number of matters we need to discuss outside of Commander Kari's hearing. The nature of your procurement was necessary. You haven't changed at all. And how this affects me is inconsequential.

Speaker 6
The subject in question has already become an active issue. Thus, these measures were inevitable. Please understand our situation. Oh, now this is surprising. Not the committee, but sailor.

Speaker 5
Creating a new guard is not on our agenda. We hope that you will cooperate, Professor

Speaker 6
Fyutski. Professor Fyutski.

Speaker 5
Hey, Professor! Professor Fyutski!

Speaker 6
Oh, hello, boys. Hey, why don't you come down and join us for a beer at the Riverwalk? What, again?

Speaker 10
Ryoko and the other girls said they'll come if you come.

Speaker 14
Yeah, and didn't the dean say you shouldn't be so unsociable? All right, you guys win. It's nice to have a chance to have a drink outside for a change.

Speaker 6
Yeah.

Speaker 14
You know, you're a brilliant scientist, but you don't place enough value in your relationships with others. I'm sorry, sir. Somehow I doubt that. However, there's a young bioengineering student who's just written a very interesting paper. Her name is Ikari. Have you heard about her before?

Speaker 6
Ikari? No, sir.

Speaker 14
I've told her about your work, and she asked if she could meet you. She'll be calling you soon, and I'd like you to take her on as a research assistant. And her name is Akari?

Speaker 6
I'll do it, sir. I read your paper last night. There are a few things I have questions about, but it's really very intriguing.

Speaker 15
Thank you very much, sir.

Speaker 6
And your full name is Yui Akari, right?

Speaker 15
Yes, sir.

Speaker 6
So, what are your career plans? Would you like to go into corporate research or join a school's research facility?

Speaker 15
Well, I haven't really thought about it much. And in my case, there may be a third option to be considered. I'm thinking about getting married and having children. Of course, that's assuming I meet the right person.

Speaker 16
By incorporating the S2 unit into itself, it has achieved its ultimate form. Evangelion Unit 1. A living God which we created. What blasphemy! The creation of a supreme being is unacceptable. Man must not

Speaker 3
create gods. No one

Speaker 6
should possess such power. Can we

Speaker 2
trust Gendo Ikari?

Speaker 6
Gendo Rokabungi? I've heard the name before.

Speaker 2
No,

Speaker 6
I've never met him. But he does seem to be at the core of a lot of rumors, rather unsavory rumors at that. What? I was appointed his advisor. Well, I'll

Speaker 5
come bail him out. I've been hearing some interesting things about you, Professor. I've been wanting to meet you for some time. Well, getting drunk and starting a fight isn't the best introduction. I didn't have a chance to say anything before they jumped me. I'm not used to being like Professor, but I'm quite familiar with hatred. Well, your problems are none of my concern. And you're exactly the kind of person that I expected Professor Fyutski to be.

Speaker 6
My first impression of him was that he was a rogue bull on a short tether. Back then, there were still seasons in this country. It was autumn. Are you serious?

Speaker 15
Yes, sir. I've been dating Gendo Rokobungi a lot.

Speaker 6
When she told me that, I couldn't hide my shock. It's rather hard imagining you and him being together.

Speaker 15
He's really very nice. It's just that nobody really knows him quite the way I do. You ought to try, sir.

Speaker 6
In this case, I think that ignorance might be bliss.

Speaker 15
Are you upset that I told him to list you as his counselor?

Speaker 6
Well, I'll admit that he's interesting, but I just don't like him. It was generally believed that the real object of Gendo's overtures to Yui was her obvious talent. That and the support of the secret organization that was arranging funding for her projects. That organization was called Sele. In the year 2000, the second impact occurred. In the first year of the 21st century was... What can I say? It was a time I still find hard to talk about.

Speaker 1
It certainly is hot over here. I hear it's going to be over 30 degrees Celsius again today. That's not rare for Japan these days. It's been summer for almost a year now. It's rough on these old bones. Why don't you move to the ship up coast? You mean the next town over? Whoa, it stinks of oil. I just can't learn to like it. Still, I can't believe you set

Speaker 6
up shop in a place like this. I had a hell of a time finding you. They're short of doctors everywhere. It's a mockery. But it's better than nothing. You mean they're going to Antarctica now?

Speaker 1
That's right. The UN's finally commissioned a formal investigation. The group conducting it is strictly provisional, of course. But I think the world needs you there more than here, Professor Fuyutski. That's former

Speaker 6
professor.

Speaker 1
By the way,

Speaker 6
this column is blank. Who recommended me? This used to be a continent of ice. The entire thing is gone. Professor Fuyutski. Huh? I don't believe it. You're alive. I'd heard that you were with the

Speaker 5
Katsuragi research team when the disaster occurred. I was, but fortunately I returned to Japan one day before the incident happened. Is that so? Mr. Rokabungi,

Speaker 6
you're a

Speaker 3
very... Excuse

Speaker 6
me, but that's not my name now. A postcard, huh?

Speaker 5
Not a business card? Ikari? Gendo Ikari? My wife has been asking me to send this to you for a while now. She's still quite a fan of yours. Quite an honor, considering. So how is Yui doing? Why isn't she on this expedition? Oh, Yui wanted to come as well, but we have a child to consider now. There are a lot of ugly rumors about this organization you work for, Sele, or whatever it's called. I don't like the way it bullies the committee. I'm afraid that it's necessary. An organization can't have too many scruples in this day and age.

Speaker 6
It may be true that Second Impact changed a lot of things. But if this official investigation team had been composed solely of Sele personnel, there would have been trouble, were the rest of us just invited for political convenience.

Speaker 12
I hate the darkness. All it does is bring back the most horrible memories.

Speaker 17
Who is she? The only survivor of the research team. Her name is Misato Katsuragi. Katsuragi? You mean Dr. Katsuragi's daughter? Yes, but she hasn't said a word in two years. How terrible. She saw hell firsthand. Her physical wounds could be healed, but repairing the damage to her mind will take time. Indeed.

Speaker 6
The entire

Speaker 17
area

Speaker 6
has been affected. Altered atmospheric composition, the complete extermination of all life forms down to the micro-organic level, traces of an enormous cavern directly below the blast center, And then there's this giant of light. This whole incident has mysteries upon mysteries. Later, the United Nations will make an official declaration that second impact had been caused by a meteor strike on Antarctica. For someone who knew what I knew, those announcements were obvious fabrications. Sele and a man named Kiel were behind the cover-up. It became my goal, my obsession to find the real answers. The truth that was being suppressed. Even if my former student Yui was involved as well.

Speaker 15
It's been a long time.

Speaker 6
Yes, it has. Why did you conceal the existence of the giant? You knew Second Impact was gonna happen, didn't you? You could talk all you want to about how it was just luck that you returned one day before it occurred. But how do you explain the fact that you brought back all the expedition's records and findings? I know for a fact your personal files contain more than we recovered, Ikari.

Speaker 5
Hm. I'm surprised that these weren't destroyed.

Speaker 6
Sloppy housework. I checked into your estate as well. Bringing up a child and educating him is expensive. But isn't

Speaker 5
this a bit much for a civil servant? Very impressive, Professor Futski. Perhaps you should be teaching economics. I'm

Speaker 6
going to go public with the real truth about you, Sele, Second Impact, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. What you've been doing here is completely inexcusable.

Speaker 5
As you wish. But first, there's something I'd like to show you. How far down will we be going? Worried, Montresor? A little bit. Oh my god. Oh, we didn't make this. Although 89% of it was buried, something or someone excavated this cavity. This was originally a giant sphere? Exactly like that underground cavity at the South Pole? The data is virtually identical, yes. And do you intend to let that tragedy be repeated again? Is that it? I'll let you determine that for yourself. But either way, every resource of the human race will be poured into this Geo front.

Speaker 7
Professor Fiyutski!

Speaker 6
Dr. Akagi? You're here too? Yes.

Speaker 7
This is the ideal place for advancing our research towards creating the ultimate biocomputer system. I'm going to name them the Magi.

Speaker 6
The Magi? The Three Wise Men of the East? Is this what you wanted to show me?

Speaker 7
No, it's over this way. Ritsuko, I'll be right back.

Speaker 6
Unbelievable. Is this the Giant of Light? No.

Speaker 7
In Gehern, we refer to the second impact giant as Atom. But this isn't that one.

Speaker 6
Then, what is this?

Speaker 7
This is what man has created from Atom. Ava.

Speaker 5
Ava? Project E, the Atom Revival Project. And that is Evangelion Unit Zero, our system prototype. Prototype? Prototype of what? Fyutski, will you join us in creating a new genesis for mankind?

Speaker 8
Uh, ma'am? Oh, I'm sorry. I zoned out. Let's proceed with Rey's repeat test. I haven't seen

Speaker 11
Major Katsuragi today.

Speaker 8
Neither have

Speaker 11
I. Uh, Katsuragi? Yeah, Misato Katsuragi. Pleased to meet ya.

Speaker 8
Dear Mother, I have just become acquainted with a girl named Katsuragi. Most people tend to keep their distance from me once they find out who I am, which forces me to remember how important your name is around here. But Misato is different. She's very open and honest, even with me. I also understand that she's the only survivor from the original research team. She used to be mute,

Speaker 7
but she talks almost constantly now, like she's trying to make up for lost time. Dear Ritsuko, I'm underground so much these days that I feel like a mole. And I'm getting royally sick and tired of living on the boxed lunches they provide here. That should improve, though. Up on the surface, they've started construction on Tokyo 3.

Speaker 8
Misato hasn't shown up at college for the last few days, and I've finally forced her to tell me why. Talk about stupid! She spent the whole week having sex with her new boyfriend. a whole week. I think there's another side to her I haven't seen before, and it disturbs me. Well, she introduced me to him today, and he's handsome all right, but his sloppy grooming and attitude really

Speaker 7
bother me. You've always been a little boy shy, Ritzko dear. I think it's because you only had a mother and no men in your life, and I'm afraid that I never reeled you in as often as I should have. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've only acted like a mother when it suited my whims, which wasn't often.

Speaker 6
Another day like every other. Why does the loss of autumn make me feel so sad? You know, if these secret Dead Sea Scrolls that Sele possesses are correct, a third impact within the next decade is inevitable.

Speaker 15
But that's why Sele and Geharan exist. To prevent that final tragedy.

Speaker 6
It's your ideas that I believe in, not Sele's.

Speaker 15
Because you know that the act of unleashing that seal could be quite dangerous.

Speaker 6
I've already given Akari the data. It's not something one individual can accomplish, after all. And there will be no repeat of my earlier stunt. I've already received a warning of sorts on that. It would appear that getting rid of me would be quite easy, it seems.

Speaker 15
But that applies to all of us. It's so easy. to destroy something.

Speaker 6
But there's no reason for you to become a test subject.

Speaker 15
I'm simply following the flow that's presented itself. That's why I'm at Zele after all. For Shinji.

Speaker 9
Why

Speaker 3
is there a child in here?

Speaker 6
That's Director Ikari's

Speaker 7
son.

Speaker 6
Ikari, this isn't a daycare center. This is an important event.

Speaker 6
I'm sorry, Professor. I'm the one who brought Shiji here. But Yui, this is your experiment today.

Speaker 15
That's why I brought him. I want to show him how great the future

Speaker 7
will be. Those words would prove to be Yui's last. A freak accident wiped her from this existence, just as I had hoped it would. What a disgusting woman I am. But Ritsuko, after that day, Director Akari changed completely.

Speaker 6
Where have you been all week? I understand your grief, but you must know that your life no longer belongs to you alone.

Speaker 5
I know. Fyutsuki, as of today we will begin the new project. I have already made the proposal to Chairman Keele. You mean it's approved? Yes. That which has never been achieved. The path to becoming one with God. Human

Speaker 8
instrumentality. Dear Mother, congratulations on the completion of your Magi theorems. I have good news, too. It's been decided that I will officially join Gehearn. I'll start working on Project Eden next month. Who's

Speaker 1
there?

Speaker 8
Dr. Ritsuko Akagi. Technological Development Section. Here's my ID. I came to see how the new Command Center installation was coming along, but I got lost.

Speaker 1
I see. The Commander and Dr. Akagi will see you in the command center.

Speaker 7
Are you alright?

Speaker 1
Yes. I have no

Speaker 5
regrets concerning my work.

Speaker 7
You're lying. You still can't forget about Yui, can you? But that's acceptable to me.

Speaker 5
And this is Gehern headquarters.

Speaker 7
Good morning, Director. Did you bring your child today? Oh, wait. I could have sworn you had a son.

Speaker 5
Oh, no. This isn't Shinji. I've decided to take care of an acquaintance's child. Her name is Rei Iannami.

Speaker 8
Hello Rei, I'm Ritsuko. She resembles someone.

Speaker 7
Yui. All the records containing Rei Iannami have been deleted. They're all blank. What's going on here? Magi Caspar, Magi Balthazar, Magi Malkior. The Magi are the three aspects of myself. Myself as a scientist, myself as a mother, and myself as a woman. Three aspects that combine to make one whole.

Speaker 8
The three faces of Mother.

Speaker 7
And all that's left to do is turn the power on. Mm-hmm. I'll be leaving early today. Misato just got back in town. Oh, yes. I'd heard that she'd just joined Gehearn. In Germany, if I recall. Uh-huh. She's with the third branch now. So, she's having a long-distance relationship? It didn't work out. They broke up, but they always seemed like such a perfect couple. The interaction of men and women isn't very logical. You're always so cool and analytical about these things. Aren't you afraid that you might lose your chance at happiness?

Speaker 8
First, I have to find a definition of happiness. It's been a while since I went out. Well, have a good one. See you later.

Speaker 7
Did you need me for something, Ray?

Speaker 18
I lost my way, Doctor.

Speaker 7
Is that so? Well, do you want to come with me then?

Speaker 18
No, thanks.

Speaker 7
But how will you get home all by yourself?

Speaker 18
That's not your business, old hag. Old hag? I can find my way home by myself, old hag.

Speaker 7
You shouldn't call someone an old hag, Rei.

Speaker 18
But you are an old hag, aren't you?

Speaker 7
I'm getting mad. Commander Akari will spank you for this, you love-- The commander

Speaker 18
is the one who calls you that. He says that old hag is annoying. That old hag is no use anymore.

Speaker 19
Old hag

Speaker 18
is

Speaker 19
no use anymore. Old hag is no use anymore.

Speaker 18
- The old hag is no use. - The commander's someone that calls you that.

Speaker 19
- He says that old hag is annoying. That old hag is no use anymore.

Speaker 7
- You little bitch! You're replaceable too, did you know that, Ray? You're just as replaceable as me!

Speaker 6
The Instrumentality Committee dissolved the Gohern Research Organization. In order to execute the project that Gohern had conceived, a new, special organization called NERV was formed. All of Gohern's existing personnel were transferred into NERV, all except one, the one that had rendered such remarkable service to the Magi system, Dr. Akagi. Well, I guess it's time to go.

Speaker 10
*Clears

Speaker 13
Here. Thank you for your cooperation.

Speaker 7
Is it over now?

Speaker 13
Yes, it is. A solution to the problem has been found.

Speaker 15
Where is he?

Speaker 13
I wouldn't know that.

Speaker 6
Oh,

Speaker 10
hi. You're a little late, aren't you?

Speaker 12
I'm home.

Speaker 20
*Gunshot* Katsuragi, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message, especially after

I caused you all so much trouble. Sorry.

Please tell Ritsu I'm sorry too.

Speaker 20
And there's one more thing to trouble you with. I've been growing a certain flower. I'd appreciate it if you could water it for me. Shinji knows where it is. Katsuragi, the truth is with you. Don't hesitate. Move ahead. If I can see you again, I will say... the words that I could not say eight years ago.

Speaker 9
Bye. This message was recorded at 2.03pm.

Speaker 2
Fool. You were always such a fool.

Speaker 19
Oh, God damn it! All I could do was run. Run away from Misato. There was nothing I could say. I was just a child.

*music* Thank you.

Speaker 11
The reality of having lost to Shinji has driven Asuka to the depths of despair. White Megana's frustration has led to attacks of panic and now mental exhaustion and bouts of paranoia. A psychological assault from a new angel delivers a final blow to Asuka's psyche, trapping her in a psychological pitfall constructed from her own worst nightmares. As the harshness of this new reality continues to tear their worlds apart, Shinji is unable to offer her any words of comfort. It all happens in the next episode. At least be

Speaker 3
human.
