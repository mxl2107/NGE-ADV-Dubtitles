Speaker 1
The young man like a man like a man, you're a young man, you're a man. The wind is now on the door, I'm just looking at you 微笑んでるあなた そっと触れるもの 求めることに夢中で 運命さえまだ知らない 痛いけな瞳 だけどいつか気づくでしょう その背中には 遥か未来目指すための羽があること 残酷な天使のテーゼ 窓辺からやがて飛び立つ ほとばしる熱いパトスで 思い出を裏切るなら This moon shining in the sky You're a man, you're a fairy tale

Speaker 2
Are you ready, Shinji? Um, yeah? Final safety locks! Release! Evangelion Unit 1! Move out!

Speaker 3
Shinji, just concentrate on walking for now.

Speaker 1
Walk? He's walking Walking

Speaker 4
Shiji, are you okay? Hurry, hurry You've got to get up - Whoa! Shinji, calm down!

Speaker 5
That's not your real arm! Where is defense system? The signal's not working! His field's not up! It's not unfolding! It's not up! Left arm damaged! The circuits have snapped! Shinji, move!

Speaker 4
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Speaker 6
There's a crack on the front of the brain case! That armor won't take much more!

Speaker 7
The head is damaged! Extended damage, unknown! The control nerves are breaking up!

Speaker 4
We're

Speaker 1
not getting

Speaker 7
any readings on the pilot! No, Shinji!

Speaker 4
Ah!

Speaker 8
Thank you. Unfamiliar ceiling.

Speaker 9
So, the angels have returned. It's rather sudden.

Speaker 10
It's the same as it was 15 years ago. That's the way of disasters, they come without warning.

Speaker 11
On the positive side, our previous investments would appear to be not such a waste after all.

Speaker 10
You can't be sure about

Speaker 9
that yet. If it doesn't pay off, it's still a waste.

Speaker 12
Correct. Now that news of the Angels has become common knowledge, Nerve must take steps to control the manner in which this information is received by the general public.

Speaker 13
You may rest assured that it's already been taken care of. Don't worry.

Speaker 14
Government officials have announced that in regard to the declaration of this incident...

Speaker 2
Public scenario B-22. Just like we thought.

Speaker 3
So we're covering up the truth again? Well, at least the PR people are happy. They finally got something to do. We're being pretty casual about it. I don't think so. Actually, I think we're all pretty scared. Of course we are.

Speaker 9
Well, we must acknowledge that. But still, I wonder,

Speaker 12
Mr. Ikari, were Nerve and Ava used efficiently? Repair costs for Unit 1 added to the development costs for Unit 0 are simply staggering.

Speaker 11
We also understand that you gave that toy to your own son. Time, money, and manpower. How much more will be wasted by you and your family? And that is not your only responsibility. The Human Enhancement Project.

Speaker 12
That should be your top priority. Correct. Under these desperate circumstances, that project may be the only real hope for the future of mankind. Do you understand? In any event, the Angels are no excuse for the delay in the

Speaker 9
schedule of that project. We may consider adjusting the budget. The rest of the meeting does not concern you.

Speaker 12
Your presence here was... appreciated. Ikari, you do know that there can be no turning back.

Speaker 13
I know. Mankind has no time left.

Speaker 2
- Man, air conditioning's the greatest thing. Man's triumph over nature! Shinji's finally woken up! And...

Speaker 3
how is he? Well, his memory seems a bit muddled, but... You don't think it could be contamination, do you? I don't think we should worry. Really? You're right. He did have a pretty hectic day. Poor little kid. His cerebellum must have taken a lot of stress. Cerebellum? Don't you mean his heart?

Speaker 2
*Bell rings* If Ava and this city both operated their full potential, we might make it through this. You're such an optimist. Hey, sometimes you need a little wishful thinking just to keep on

Speaker 3
living. I see your point. It's nice to hear a positive attitude. I'll see you later. Okay,

Speaker 15
see ya. Dr. Ugai, internal department one. Dr. Ugai, internal department one. Please

Speaker 4
call Dr. Azuma

Speaker 15
of the first surgical department immediately. The medical conference regarding the B experiment will

Speaker 4
be held

Speaker 15
as scheduled. All supervisors, please proceed to conference room 2.

Speaker 3
They don't want to live together? Are you sure?

Speaker 10
I think that living apart is natural to them.

Speaker 3
And being together is unnatural?

Speaker 2
He'll be living alone?

Speaker 9
That's right. His room will be on the sixth block beyond this one. Is that alright?

Speaker 2
Yes, sir. Shinji,

Speaker 8
are you sure about that? Living alone is fine with me. I'm alone anyway.

Speaker 2
What did you say? You heard me! I said I'll be taking Shinji home to live in my place, okay? It's already been approved. And don't worry, I'm not gonna be making any passes at him. Of

Speaker 4
course you're

Speaker 3
not! How could you even think of such a thing? You've got no shame at

Speaker 2
all! Some people don't have any sense of humor. Well, I guess we have to have a party tonight, huh? Why is that? It's a welcoming party in honor of my new roommate, of course.

Speaker 16
- This city would become a battlefield.

Speaker 2
- Yeah,

Speaker 16
my husband's saying that at least the kids and I should move. - Don't I know it. This city may be a fortress, but that's no guarantee of safety. Just thinking about

Speaker 2
it. I hope you don't mind if we make a little stop on the way.

Speaker 8
A stop where?

Speaker 2
Oh, it's a really cool place.

Speaker 8
It's so desolate. The city seems so lonely. Here we

Speaker 2
go.

Speaker 14
*Sigh*

Speaker 2
The city is a fortress designed to stand against the angels. This is Tokyo 3. This is our city, and it's the city that you saved.

The End The End

Speaker 2
Your things ought to have been delivered already, Shinji. I just moved here myself, you know? Hey, come in!

Speaker 8
Uh... - True.

Speaker 2
- Shinji, this is your home now.

Speaker 8
- I'm, I'm home.

Speaker 2
- Welcome home. - Um, as you can see, the place is just a little bit messy, but go ahead and make yourself comfortable.

Speaker 8
- This is a

Speaker 2
little messy? Oh, sorry, could you put the food in the fridge, please?

Speaker 8
Uh, yes, ma'am. Ice, snacks, and 50 gallons of beer. What kind of life does she lead? Huh.

Speaker 5
Uh, excuse me.

Speaker 2
What's

Speaker 5
in the other fridge? Oh, don't

Speaker 2
mind that. He's probably still sleeping.

Speaker 8
Sleeping? Let's eat! Yeah, let's eat.

Speaker 2
Woo! Yeah! Good stuff! You know, life just doesn't get any better than this. Hmm? Not hungry? It's good, even if it is all instant. I'm sorry. I'm just not

Speaker 8
used to food like this. What?

Speaker 2
Are you finicky? Um, no, that's not what... Isn't this nice? Having two for dinner sure beats eating alone, huh? Here we go. Let's go for the next one. Paper, scissors, stone. Three, two, one, go! I'm sorry, Shinji. Okay, that was a really fair way to split up the chores, wasn't it? Yeah. This is your home, so feel free to take advantage of everything here. Except, of course, of me, that is. Uh, yes, ma'am. Yes, yes, yes. Is that all you can say? It's getting on

Speaker 4
my nerves! You're a bully!

Speaker 2
Act like one! Yes, ma'am!

Speaker 1
I guess that's just the way you are.

Speaker 2
Why don't you go take a bath? Yeah, wash away your

Speaker 4
troubles

Speaker 2
bathing cleans the mind and soul What Huh, oh yeah, he's one of those new warm water penguins *cough

Speaker 8
* *Gasp* Ah, Misato Katsaragi.

Speaker 2
She's

Speaker 8
not a bad person.

Speaker 2
Bathing cleans the mind and soul.

Speaker 8
But bad memories always seem to find me in the bath. Like my father. And that girl,

Speaker 3
Ray. So how was Ray today? You did see her at the hospital today, didn't you?

Speaker 13
She can work again in 20 days. By then we'll be ready to reactivate Unit Zero from cryostasis.

Speaker 3
It's so hard on these children.

Speaker 13
There is no one else who can pilot the Evas. As long as they survive, that is what I'll have them do.

Speaker 3
With no regard to what they may want?

Speaker 2
Yeah, after all the horrible stuff he went through, I don't think he'll pilot again.

Speaker 3
Maintaining him is part of your job. I'm just scared. I don't know

Speaker 2
how to deal with him.

Speaker 3
Grumbling already? But it was your idea to take him in, you know.

Speaker 2
Oh, shut up! I was just thinking of Shinji as a tool. I'm as shameless as Ritsuko. We destroyed the angel, but... I don't feel happy.

Speaker 8
Another unfamiliar ceiling. Of course. In this whole city, there's no place that's familiar.

Speaker 2
This is your home now.

Speaker 8
Why am I here?

Speaker 5
*Extended Pulses are flowing

Speaker 4
backwards! Break the circuit

Speaker 5
now! Do it! We can't! It's not accepting the signal! What about

Speaker 7
Shinji? His monitors aren't reacting. His

Speaker 2
condition's unknown.

Speaker 5
Unit

Speaker 11
1's gone completely

Speaker 2
silent. Misato! We've got no choice. Abort the operation! We've got to rescue the pilot! Eject the entry plug! We can't! It's

Speaker 5
completely out of control! What did you say?

Speaker 15
The Eva's reactivating. I don't believe it! This can't be! My god! Berserker.

Speaker 12
We've done it.

Speaker 3
It's an AT field! No,

Speaker 2
not now! As long as that field is

Speaker 3
up! He can't get

Speaker 7
near that angel! The left arm's regenerated itself! No way!

Speaker 6
Unit 1's expanding its own AT field! It's neutralizing the base space! No! It's breaking through it!

Speaker 2
It went through the AT field like it wasn't there!

Speaker 2
*Sounds of Is the Ava?

Speaker 3
That must be... Ava's true form.

Speaker 6
Circuits

Speaker 4
reconnected. System's

Speaker 6
restored. Graf's back to normal. Pilot life science confirmed!

Speaker 2
Preserving the pilot's life is our first priority! Send out the recovery team! Hurry!

Speaker 17
*Gunshot* *Sigh* Hang in there.

Speaker 14
In other words, darling, kiss me. Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore. You are all I long for, all I worship and adore. In other words, please be true In other words,

Speaker 2
I love you Shinji's life is busier than ever, but he keeps to himself friendless until it's revealed that he's an Ava pilot. However, this new hero status brings both embarrassment and the rap of one boy in particular. Don't miss the next episode, and I'll sneak in a little bonus, okay?
