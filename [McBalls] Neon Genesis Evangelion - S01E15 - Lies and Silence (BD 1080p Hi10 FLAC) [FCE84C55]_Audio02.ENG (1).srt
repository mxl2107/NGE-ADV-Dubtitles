1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,580
Speaker 1: The young man like a man like a man

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:23,820
Speaker 1: You are a young man, you are a fairy tale

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,880
Speaker 1: If the wind is now on the door,

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,860
Speaker 1: I can only see myself,

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: You are smiling

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,440
Speaker 1: You are so happy

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,260
Speaker 1: You are so happy

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,400
Speaker 1: I don't know what you can do

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,380
Speaker 1: You are so happy

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,480
Speaker 1: But I will know that you will find the back of your back

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,980
Speaker 1: The future will be the way to the future

12
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:10,280
Speaker 1: The holy of the天使 of the day

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,500
Speaker 1: The window from the day to the day

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,740
Speaker 1: The hot-to-day light of the day

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,680
Speaker 1: The dream of the day to the day

16
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:29,460
Speaker 1: The sky will be the shining

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,620
Speaker 2: Ashton.

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,840
Speaker 3: The fact

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,780
Speaker 2: that the instrumentality project is behind schedule?

20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,380
Speaker 2: The

21
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,400
Speaker 3: projects are all linked together. There are no problems.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,380
Speaker 2: Including Rey?

23
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,780
Speaker 2: Well, I won't press you.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,240
Speaker 2: So how will we deal with you-know-who?

25
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,280
Speaker 2: Let him do as he wishes. The same with the Marduk Institute.

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,200
Speaker 2: I agree. We can make use of him. For a while.

27
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,700
Speaker 2: What

28
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,780
Speaker 4: started here?

29
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,720
Speaker 4: Sixteen years ago.

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,980
Speaker 5: It's me.

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,960
Speaker 4: Ah, so it is.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,360
Speaker 4: This

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,860
Speaker 5: is Shannon Bio Inc., a foreign chemical firm.

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Speaker 5: It's been like this for nine years, nine years without a single change.

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,520
Speaker 5: So far, 106 corporations out of the 108 affiliated with the Marduk Institute have turned out to be dummy companies.

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,180
Speaker 4: And this one is the 107th.

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Speaker 5: This is the company's registration record.

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaker 4: And you want me to take a look at the board of directors, don't you?

39
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,640
Speaker 5: You already know about this?

40
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:19,980
Speaker 5: I

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,900
Speaker 4: know most of the names, yes.

42
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:30,300
Speaker 4: The Marduk Institute is supposed to be an advisory body established under the control of the Human Instrumentality Committee for the purpose of selecting EVA pilots.

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,260
Speaker 4: Something's not adding up right here.

44
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,900
Speaker 5: Your task is to investigate Nerve. Getting involved with the Marduk may be an ill-advised step.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Speaker 4: Well, I can't help it. My nose for trouble has a penchant for getting my eyes in the

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,440
Speaker 5: wrong places.

47
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Speaker 4: Hi, this is Kaji. I'm out right now, but you can leave your name and a message at the beep.

48
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,100
Speaker 6: Help me, Kaji!

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,960
Speaker 6: Don't touch me, you pervert!

50
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,780
Speaker 7: That ought to do it.

51
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:00,960
Speaker 7: What's going

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,240
Speaker 1: on?

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,740
Speaker 7: I was just calling Kaji.

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,700
Speaker 7: I wanted him to take me out tomorrow.

55
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,660
Speaker 7: I've been calling him and calling him, but he's always out these days.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,780
Speaker 7: He's always out doing something.

57
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,280
Speaker 7: You mean you'll be available tomorrow?

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
Speaker 7: Unfortunately, it seems so.

59
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,440
Speaker 7: Great! Then I've got a favor to ask you.

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,480
Speaker 7: Well, you see...

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,900
Speaker 8: What? A date?

62
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,900
Speaker 8: The guy's a friend of Kadama, my big sister,

63
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,940
Speaker 8: and he keeps asking and asking me to set you and him up.

64
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,060
Speaker 7: Pretty please?

65
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,860
Speaker 9: Huh?

66
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,520
Speaker 9: Get back to your work!

67
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,600
Speaker 9: Sorry.

68
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,760
Speaker 10: Why don't you get back to work, Toji?

69
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,960
Speaker 7: Microsis operation completed.

70
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,680
Speaker 7: Inversible

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,380
Speaker 10: graph measurement

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,880
Speaker 9: byline.

73
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,000
Speaker 9: So,

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,260
Speaker 11: which dress are you wearing?

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,180
Speaker 11: Oh, for the wedding tomorrow?

76
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,540
Speaker 6: Well, I

77
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,300
Speaker 8: wore the pink suit for Kiyomi's wedding,

78
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,780
Speaker 8: and I wore the dark blue dress for Kotoko's shower, and...

79
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,160
Speaker 8: There's that orange one.

80
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,580
Speaker 8: You haven't worn that one lately.

81
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,760
Speaker 8: The orange one?

82
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,860
Speaker 8: Well, there's a reason I haven't worn it.

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Speaker 8: It's too tight.

84
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,240
Speaker 8: Thank you!

85
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,440
Speaker 8: Maybe I should just buy a new one.

86
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,160
Speaker 8: Man, all these stupid weddings are killing my bank account.

87
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,820
Speaker 8: Tell me about it.

88
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,980
Speaker 8: We've been to so many showers, I'm almost broke.

89
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,660
Speaker 8: Yeah, it's like everyone's in a rush to get married before they turn

90
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,040
Speaker 11: 30.

91
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Speaker 11: And you don't want to be the last one still single, do you?

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,260
Speaker 7: Excuse me?

93
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,900
Speaker 7: Okay, you

94
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,040
Speaker 11: guys can take off now.

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,060
Speaker 7: Good work.

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,780
Speaker 7: It's about time!

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,660
Speaker 7: These stupid experiments are really getting on my nerves!

98
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,080
Speaker 7: Speaking of

99
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,180
Speaker 11: which, Shinji seems more subdued than usual.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,300
Speaker 11: Tomorrow's the day.

101
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
Speaker 11: Oh, yeah. Tomorrow.

102
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,360
Speaker 9: Tomorrow.

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,420
Speaker 9: I have to see my father tomorrow.

104
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,140
Speaker 9: What should I talk to him about, Rei?

105
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,120
Speaker 9: I don't understand. Why are you asking me?

106
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,420
Speaker 9: Because I've seen you talking with my father and actually enjoying it.

107
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,040
Speaker 9: Say, my father.

108
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,780
Speaker 9: What's he like?

109
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,900
I don't know.

110
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,140
Speaker 12: Oh.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,780
Speaker 12: Have you been watching me because you wanted to ask that question?

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,520
Speaker 12: Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,820
Speaker 12: Hey, when we were cleaning, that cloth,

114
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,460
Speaker 9: the way you ringed it,

115
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,640
Speaker 9: it reminded me of a mother when you squeezed it.

116
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,780
Speaker 9: A mother?

117
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,320
Speaker 9: Yeah.

118
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,440
Speaker 9: It just reminded me of a mom.

119
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,120
Speaker 9: I bet you'll make a great mother, Ray.

120
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,040
Speaker 9: I mean...

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,560
Speaker 1: You...

122
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,220
Speaker 1: Embarrass me.

123
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,000
Speaker 7: I'm home!

124
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,180
Speaker 7: What's

125
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,560
Speaker 12: happening?

126
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,920
Speaker 7: You better go to bed, Oscar.

127
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,080
Speaker 7: Don't you have a date tomorrow?

128
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,760
Speaker 7: With some med student.

129
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,880
Speaker 7: Oh, Misato!

130
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,380
Speaker 7: - Yo, can I use your lavender perfume?

131
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,640
Speaker 7: - Uh, no.

132
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
Speaker 7: - No, Nini.

133
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,380
Speaker 7: - That stuff's not for kids.

134
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,840
Speaker 7: Is Shinji in his room?

135
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,060
Speaker 7: - Yeah, ever since he got home.

136
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,980
Speaker 7: I don't think he wants to meet his father.

137
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,680
Speaker 7: If he hates him so much, why doesn't he just say?

138
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,640
Speaker 7: You Japanese are weird.

139
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,120
Speaker 7: - Well, he doesn't actually hate him.

140
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,760
Speaker 7: That's the

141
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,080
Speaker 8: problem.

142
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,700
Speaker 3: - Leave.

143
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,660
Speaker 3: Good work, Shinji.

144
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,960
Speaker 8: Shinji!

145
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,120
Speaker 8: I'm coming in, okay?

146
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,260
Speaker 8: You're worried about seeing your father tomorrow, right?

147
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,380
Speaker 8: You mustn't run away, Shinji.

148
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,780
Speaker 8: Nothing will ever change unless you have the courage to step forward.

149
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,360
Speaker 8: I know that, Misato.

150
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,100
Speaker 8: You're going to find out the truth.

151
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
Speaker 8: You've got to keep moving forward.

152
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,680
Speaker 8: After each step, you've got to keep taking another afterwards.

153
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,300
Speaker 8: Anyway, when you see him tomorrow,

154
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,020
Speaker 8: you've got to keep your chin held high,

155
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,060
Speaker 8: because you'll be seeing her too.

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,980
Speaker 8: Good night, Shinji.

157
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
Speaker 10: You bought a new dress, didn't you?

158
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,900
Speaker 10: Let me see.

159
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,240
Speaker 10: Oh, you want to see it, do you?

160
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,520
Speaker 10: It's an expensive one.

161
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,340
Speaker 10: Price doesn't

162
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,080
Speaker 7: always be pleasant.

163
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,780
Speaker 7: You're on.

164
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,060
Speaker 7: Tell me about it.

165
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,300
Speaker 7: Well, what do you think? Did you pick that one with Paji in mind?

166
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,000
Speaker 7: Grow up.

167
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,880
Speaker 7: Long time

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,120
ago.

169
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,219
Speaker 7: Well, see ya.

170
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:42,840
Speaker 7: Later.

171
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,040
Speaker 8: You must keep three bags in your heart.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,180
Speaker 8: And now, let us proceed to the reception.

173
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,120
Speaker 11: Little boy

174
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,020
Speaker 8: Blue is late.

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,720
Speaker 8: That over-sexed idiot's never been on time in his whole lazy life.

176
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,800
Speaker 8: For your dates, you mean? He gets to work early.

177
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,360
Speaker 4: Hello, girls. You're looking particularly lovely today.

178
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Speaker 4: I had a little trouble getting out of work on time.

179
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:14,580
Speaker 4: I find

180
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,620
Speaker 8: that hard to believe since you don't do anything.

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,860
Speaker 8: You could at least

182
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,080
Speaker 4: have

183
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,700
Speaker 8: taken the time and trouble to shave that awful stubble.

184
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,560
Speaker 8: Your tie is crooked.

185
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,240
Speaker 4: Well, thank you.

186
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,000
Speaker 4: You act like you're married.

187
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,760
Speaker 4: You're very astute, Ritsipoo.

188
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,740
Speaker 8: Who'd marry

189
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,380
Speaker 6: this bum?

190
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,220
Speaker 3: It's been three years since we were last here.

191
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
Speaker 9: That's when I ran away.

192
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,840
Speaker 9: I haven't come back here since then.

193
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,920
Speaker 9: I just don't believe that my mom is really resting here.

194
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
Speaker 9: I don't even remember her face.

195
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,280
Speaker 3: Burying memories is man's way of surviving

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,020
Speaker 3: But there are some things a man should never forget

197
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Speaker 3: Yui taught me that one irreplaceable thing, Shinji

198
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,080
Speaker 3: That is the reason I come here, to confirm that commitment

199
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
Speaker 9: You don't have a picture of her?

200
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,740
Speaker 3: No photographs

201
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,980
Speaker 3: Even this grave is an artifice

202
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,040
Speaker 3: Nothing remains

203
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,160
Speaker 9: That's like my teacher said

204
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
Speaker 9: You cast everything away

205
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,020
Speaker 3: Everything is kept in my heart

206
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,799
Speaker 3: I'm satisfied with that

207
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,860
Speaker 3: Our time is up.

208
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,160
Speaker 3: I'm leaving now.

209
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,300
Speaker 9: Father!

210
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,000
Speaker 9: I'm glad that we could talk together today.

211
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,480
Speaker 3: Indeed.

212
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,140
-

213
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,280
Speaker 7: I'm not sure what

214
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,700
Speaker 9: you

215
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 9: But I could have quit any time.

216
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,080
Speaker 9: So

217
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,740
Speaker 7: why didn't you?

218
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,080
Speaker 7: Huh?

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,380
Speaker 9: Nobody told me to stop, I guess.

220
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,020
Speaker 9: Oh, I should have known.

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,700
Speaker 9: Hey, you're back early.

222
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,200
Speaker 9: I thought you were going out to dinner, too.

223
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,720
Speaker 7: Oh, my date was even more boring than you.

224
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,500
Speaker 7: Saw Wiley was standing in line for the roller coaster,

225
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,900
Speaker 7: I took a train back here.

226
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,720
Speaker 9: That seems kind of cold.

227
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,560
Speaker 7: Oh, gosh, he's the only real man in my life.

228
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,780
Speaker 7: I know it's getting a little late,

229
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,120
Speaker 7: but I've

230
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,500
Speaker 8: got to go powder my nose.

231
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,060
Speaker 4: Making a quick exit?

232
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,960
Speaker 4: High heels.

233
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,180
Speaker 4: It's been a while since we went out together.

234
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,040
Speaker 11: She's drinking too much.

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,700
Speaker 11: She's losing her control.

236
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,460
Speaker 4: Sometimes you just have to drink to keep yourself under control.

237
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,580
Speaker 4: All of us do.

238
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,960
Speaker 11: Well, you did used to live with her, so I guess you'd know the truth.

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,520
Speaker 4: Well, that was a lifetime ago.

240
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,820
Speaker 4: She didn't even own a set of heels back then.

241
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,080
Speaker 11: That's not how we saw it back when we were in school.

242
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,360
Speaker 4: We were kids, Ritsu.

243
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,860
Speaker 4: That wasn't real.

244
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,160
Speaker 4: We were just children playing house.

245
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Speaker 4: It was nice.

246
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,180
Speaker 4: But life's not that simple.

247
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Speaker 4: Oh, I almost forgot.

248
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,200
Speaker 11: The cat dragged this in.

249
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,480
Speaker 11: Thank you, Kaji, for being

250
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,000
Speaker 4: honest.

251
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,920
Speaker 4: To the ladies, yes.

252
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:09,620
Speaker 4: Otherwise,

253
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,540
Speaker 11: eh...

254
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,400
Speaker 11: I doubt that.

255
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,260
Speaker 11: And Misato?

256
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,080
Speaker 4: I've lost that war before.

257
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,040
Speaker 4: Doom battles aren't my style.

258
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,680
Speaker 11: I think you still have a chance.

259
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,800
Speaker 4: Well, what about you?

260
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
Speaker 11: Oh, I don't like to talk about myself.

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,240
Speaker 11: There's nothing much to say.

262
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,580
Speaker 4: Why is she taking so long?

263
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,040
Speaker 4: How much makeup can she wear?

264
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,600
Speaker 11: Hmm.

265
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,260
Speaker 4: What

266
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,400
Speaker 11: were you doing in Kyoto?

267
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,440
Speaker 4: I wasn't in Kyoto.

268
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,440
Speaker 11: Don't try to fool me.

269
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,340
Speaker 11: You'll get your fingers burned if you get too involved in this.

270
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,140
Speaker 11: That's the advice of a friend.

271
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,140
Speaker 4: I'd rather be burned by the heat of my passion for you.

272
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,760
Speaker 8: Well, should I buy you some fireworks?

273
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,980
Speaker 4: Hello.

274
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,280
Speaker 8: Oh, you never change, do you?

275
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,700
Speaker 4: Of course I change.

276
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,400
Speaker 4: The act of living is an embracement of change.

277
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,260
Speaker 11: Homeostasis and transestasis.

278
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,200
Speaker 11: Homeo-what?

279
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,540
Speaker 11: One is a force to maintain the present status,

280
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,620
Speaker 11: and the other is a force for constant change.

281
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,560
Speaker 11: Anything that lives is composed of these two conflicting forces.

282
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,020
Speaker 4: Like men and women.

283
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,080
Speaker 11: I'll just be taking off now. I've got some work to do.

284
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,500
Speaker 11: Now?

285
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,300
Speaker 4: That's too bad.

286
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,300
Speaker 4: Mm-hmm. Have fun.

287
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,880
Speaker 8: But...

288
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,380
Speaker 8: -

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Speaker 8: - Hey, Shinji, it's me.

290
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,120
Speaker 8: I'm gonna be out drinking with Kaji.

291
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,260
Speaker 8: Don't wait up for me, okay?

292
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,240
Speaker 9: - Right.

293
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,280
Speaker 9: Yeah, sure.

294
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,600
Speaker 9: - Misato?

295
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,600
Speaker 9: - Yeah, she'll be late, so don't wait up for her.

296
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,480
Speaker 7: - What?

297
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,560
Speaker 7: You mean she won't be back until tomorrow morning?

298
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,780
Speaker 9: - I doubt it.

299
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,460
Speaker 9: She's going out with Kaji.

300
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,480
Speaker 9: - Are you dense?

301
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,880
Speaker 9: That guarantees it.

302
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,100
Speaker 8: Drinking

303
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,200
Speaker 4: till you throw up.

304
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,920
Speaker 4: How old are you?

305
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,820
Speaker 8: Old enough to regret it.

306
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,300
Speaker 4: I'm old enough as well.

307
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,660
Speaker 8: You're damn right.

308
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,540
Speaker 8: I can't

309
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,260
Speaker 4: believe that you wear high heels these days.

310
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,160
Speaker 4: Time really does fly.

311
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,040
Speaker 8: You need to shave your sloppy face.

312
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Speaker 6: Okay, let

313
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,480
Speaker 8: me walk.

314
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,420
Speaker 8: Thank you.

315
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,360
Speaker 8: Kaji, do you think I've changed?

316
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,260
Speaker 4: You're even prettier.

317
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,800
Speaker 8: Not what I mean.

318
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,840
Speaker 8: When I told you there was someone else, it wasn't true.

319
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,540
Speaker 8: But you knew that, didn't you?

320
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,240
Speaker 4: No.

321
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,600
Speaker 8: One morning, I just realized how much like my father you were.

322
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,160
Speaker 8: I panicked.

323
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,040
Speaker 8: I couldn't believe that I wanted a man just like my father.

324
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,800
Speaker 8: I was terrified, so I ran.

325
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,200
Speaker 8: I was so scared.

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,040
Speaker 8: I was afraid of becoming a woman, afraid of being with you,

327
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,860
Speaker 8: and thought I hated my father.

328
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,860
Speaker 8: But then I fell in love with a man who was just like my father.

329
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,480
Speaker 8: I thought joining Nerve would be a way to sever those ties.

330
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,900
Speaker 8: And then it turned out that my father was with Nerve.

331
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,820
Speaker 8: So I tried to bury all of my feelings by swearing to avenge myself against the angels.

332
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,380
Speaker 4: Choosing that path was your decision.

333
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,820
Speaker 4: You don't have to apologize to anyone.

334
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,340
Speaker 8: Don't bullshit me, Kaji.

335
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,660
Speaker 8: I just turned tail and ran.

336
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,860
Speaker 8: It was just an escape from the real world and my father.

337
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,100
Speaker 8: I'm no better than Shinji is.

338
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,700
Speaker 8: I'm a Kawagashi.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,260
Speaker 8: Well, it's just like right now.

340
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,260
Speaker 8: I had to get up the nerve to get drunk enough to even tell

341
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,960
Speaker 12: you the truth.

342
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,160
Speaker 8: I'm a child.

343
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,680
Speaker 8: I have no right to be Shinji's

344
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:53,860
Speaker 12: guardian.

345
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,640
Speaker 8: Look at me, afraid to accept a helping hand up from a man

346
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,000
Speaker 8: except when I'm so falling down drunk that I don't even know what I'm doing.

347
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,100
Speaker 8: I'm a horrible woman and I'd use you, use

348
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,140
Speaker 6: you because I'm

349
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,540
Speaker 8: a coward.

350
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,000
Speaker 8: I'm pathetic.

351
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,780
Speaker 7: Hey, Shinji.

352
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,140
Speaker 7: You wanna kiss me?

353
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,060
Speaker 7: Huh?

354
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,820
Speaker 6: What?

355
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,980
Speaker 7: Kissing, you know. Have you ever done it?

356
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,260
Speaker 7: Uh-uh.

357
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,940
Speaker 7: So let's do it.

358
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,300
Speaker 7: But why?

359
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
Speaker 7: I've got nothing else to do.

360
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,940
Speaker 7: That's your reason?

361
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,480
Speaker 9: You're weird.

362
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,860
Speaker 7: Afraid to kiss a girl on the anniversary of your mom's death?

363
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,160
Speaker 7: Is she watching you from up in heaven?

364
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,340
Speaker 7: That's not

365
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,380
Speaker 9: it.

366
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:52,600
Speaker 9: Or

367
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,660
Speaker 7: are you scared?

368
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,320
Speaker 7: I'm not

369
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 9: afraid!

370
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,860
Speaker 7: Pucker up!

371
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,720
Speaker 7: Right. Did you brush her teeth?

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:58,980
Speaker 7: Yeah.

373
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,400
Speaker 7: Then here I come.

374
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,440
Speaker 7: Stop breathing. It's tickling me.

375
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,460
Speaker 6: *Gasp*

376
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,620
Speaker 4: - Hang on, we're here.

377
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,020
Speaker 4: - Hey, Kaji.

378
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:11,760
Speaker 7: - What?

379
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,020
Speaker 7: Hey, hello, Kaji.

380
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,000
Speaker 4: - There, I'll be leaving now.

381
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,860
Speaker 7: - You can spend the night here.

382
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,520
Speaker 4: - I'd never live it down if I went to work like this.

383
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,240
Speaker 7: - Oh, you could do it.

384
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,580
Speaker 7: Hey, come on, Kaji, it'd...

385
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,860
Speaker 4: Later, Asuka.

386
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,640
Speaker 9: Lavender review.

387
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,880
Speaker 4: Take care of Misato, okay?

388
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,360
Speaker 9: Sure.

389
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,960
Speaker 9: Good night, Kaji.

390
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:45,780
Speaker 4: Yeah.

391
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,720
Speaker 9: What's wrong? You look upset.

392
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,100
Speaker 7: That's because you kissed me, you jerk!

393
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,560
Speaker 9: Let me call a roll.

394
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,140
Speaker 9: Ladies first.

395
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,380
Speaker 9: Ayanami? Rei Ayanami? Is she absent again?

396
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,160
Speaker 4: *Bell rings

397
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,980
Speaker 8: And the other would appear to be a spy for the Japanese government.

398
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,400
Speaker 4: Hm. So you knew.

399
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,000
Speaker 8: Don't underestimate nerve.

400
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,120
Speaker 4: Was this ordered by Ikari?

401
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,220
Speaker 8: No. My initiative. But if you stay with this other job, you'll die.

402
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,860
Speaker 4: Perhaps not. Commander Ikari is using me for his own ends.

403
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,500
Speaker 4: But I am sorry that I've kept this secret from you.

404
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,080
Speaker 8: I'll let it pass. Repayment for your help yesterday.

405
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,980
Speaker 4: I appreciate that. But you should know that the Commander and Ritsuko are hiding something from you too.

406
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,300
Speaker 4: And this is it!

407
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,620
Speaker 8: Oh my god.

408
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,220
Speaker 8: Is it an Eva?

409
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,800
Speaker 8: No, it can't be.

410
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,800
Speaker 4: Yes.

411
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,500
Speaker 4: The key to the second impact and everything that's happened since.

412
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,620
Speaker 4: The starting point of everything.

413
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,400
Speaker 4: This is Adam.

414
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,000
Speaker 8: Adam?

415
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,260
Speaker 8: But why is the first angel here?

416
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
Speaker 8: You're right, Kashi.

417
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,360
Speaker 8: I don't know, Nerv.

418
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,800
Speaker 8: I don't know NERV at all!

419
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,640
Speaker 12: Darling, kiss me

420
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,780
Speaker 12: Fill my heart with song

421
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,880
Speaker 12: And let me sing forevermore

422
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,980
Speaker 12: You are all I long

423
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,080
Speaker 12: For all I worship and I do

424
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,900
Speaker 12: In other words

425
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,400
Speaker 12: Please be true

426
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
Speaker 12: Before the world

427
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,620
I love you

428
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,300
Speaker 10: After finally getting ahead of Asuka and the sync tests,

429
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,720
Speaker 10: Shinji is full of pride, but everything comes crashing down

430
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,220
Speaker 10: when he's swallowed by the Sea of Darak.

431
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,380
Speaker 10: As his Ava's energy supply runs out, fear and loneliness surround him,

432
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
Speaker 10: enveloping him in a new level of anguish and despair.

433
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,760
Speaker 10: His very survival is at stake in the next thrilling episode.
