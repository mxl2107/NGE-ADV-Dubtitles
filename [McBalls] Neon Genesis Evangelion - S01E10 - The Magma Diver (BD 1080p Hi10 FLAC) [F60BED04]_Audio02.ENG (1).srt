1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Speaker 1: I just saw you

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,600
Speaker 1: I'm smiling

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,960
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to see you

5
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,420
Speaker 1: I'm still not sure

6
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,200
Speaker 1: I'm not sure

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:59,980
Speaker 1: But I'll see you soon

8
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,720
Speaker 1: I'm so excited to see you next time.

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,840
Speaker 2: Fuck me! I'm so glad I'm going shopping with you, Kaji!

10
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,060
Speaker 3: Hey, wait a second. Isn't this the swimsuit section?

11
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,960
Speaker 2: That's right! What do you think of this one?

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,800
Speaker 3: Um, aren't you just a little young to be wearing something like that, Asuka?

13
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,540
Speaker 2: Oh, come on, Kaji. This is what all the girls are wearing.

14
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,400
Speaker 3: Oh, really?

15
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,240
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Oh, I'm so anxious about this school trip. I just know we'll have a great time.

16
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,300
Speaker 3: So, where is your class going?

17
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,660
Speaker 2: Okinawa! It's gonna be awesome! We're even gonna go scuba diving!

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,580
Speaker 3: Scuba diving, huh? Boy, it's been years since the last time I went diving.

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,840
Speaker 2: Hey, where'd you go for your school trip, Kaji?

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,580
Speaker 3: Well, actually, we didn't have one.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,100
Speaker 2: Why is that?

22
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,780
Speaker 3: Just a little thing called the second impact.

23
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,960
Speaker 2: What? Did you just think I can't go on the trip?

24
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,700
Speaker 4: Yep.

25
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,020
Speaker 4: Well, why not?

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Speaker 4: It's part of your job.

27
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,040
Speaker 4: You mean I'm on permanent standby?

28
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,240
Speaker 4: You got it.

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,840
Speaker 4: What idiot decided that?

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,980
Speaker 4: This one. The operations planning manager.

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,719
Speaker 2: Shinji, why don't you stop hiding behind that cup of tea

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
Speaker 2: and talk some sense into this woman.

33
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,460
Speaker 2: Act like a man.

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,260
Speaker 5: Well, you know, actually, I had kind of expected

35
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,420
Speaker 5: that we wouldn't be allowed to go.

36
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 5: So you've already given

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,160
Speaker 4: up.

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:00,820
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,940
Speaker 4: Huh, pathetic.

40
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,840
Speaker 4: There's nothing more useless than a housebroken male.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,900
Speaker 1: Hey, don't talk about me like that.

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,520
Speaker 4: Look, I know how you must feel,

43
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,840
Speaker 4: but there's just no other way.

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,500
Speaker 4: There's always the possibility

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,540
Speaker 4: that an angel might attack while you're away.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,280
Speaker 4: So I

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Speaker 2: get stuck here on standby status

48
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,380
Speaker 2: while everyone else is having fun?

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,119
Speaker 2: Why is it that we're the ones

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Speaker 2: who always have to be ready to defend against them.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,140
Speaker 2: Any good officer knows that the best defense is a good offense.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,500
Speaker 2: Why can't we find them and attack them first?

53
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,060
Speaker 2: - If we could

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,260
Speaker 4: do that, we would do it.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,220
Speaker 4: Look, think of this as an opportunity

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,660
Speaker 4: to get ahead for a change.

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,020
Speaker 4: The two of you can catch up on your studies

58
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,960
Speaker 4: while the rest of your classmates are on the trip.

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,800
Speaker 4: Or did you think I hadn't seen these report cards?

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,300
Speaker 4: I guess you thought I wouldn't know

61
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,720
Speaker 4: about your test scores yet.

62
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,219
Speaker 4: Well, all of your grades are forwarded directly

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,640
Speaker 4: to my terminal and I have been very disappointed

64
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,600
Speaker 4: with the both of you.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,340
Speaker 4: - Ah, this is so silly and this school's grades

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,100
Speaker 4: are just dumb.

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,900
Speaker 4: The old fashioned numeric grading scale you use

68
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,100
Speaker 4: on your exams is stupid.

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,120
Speaker 4: - In Rome, do as the Romans do.

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,160
Speaker 4: You could at least try to adjust to Japanese school life.

71
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:07,620
Speaker 6: - This sucks!

72
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,160
Speaker 6: - Hey Asuka, I'll bring you back something

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,700
Speaker 2: nice.

74
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:16,739
Speaker 2: - Sayonara suckers.

75
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,780
Speaker 2: - Hey, don't worry.

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,700
Speaker 2: enough fun for the both of you!

77
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Speaker 7: Post the survey data on Mount Asimel from Balthazar

78
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,660
Speaker 7: to Melchior as soon as possible.

79
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,820
Speaker 8: A school trip, huh?

80
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,000
Speaker 8: That sounds pretty reckless in times like these.

81
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
Speaker 4: I guess the idea is to let all the kids

82
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,980
Speaker 4: have time to get out and act like kids while they can.

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
Speaker 4: *BOOM

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,620
*

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,060
Speaker 2: Hmm, what have you got there, Shinji?

86
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,820
Speaker 5: Basic physics primer.

87
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,220
Speaker 5: Oh,

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,280
Speaker 2: you're such an obedient student.

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,460
Speaker 1: Well, I'll have to study it anyway. I mean, I...

90
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,200
Speaker 2: Well, if I can't go diving in Okinawa, let's do it here.

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Speaker 2: Do what?

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,860
Speaker 2: Diving, of course.

93
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,580
Speaker 2: So what are you working on?

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,740
Speaker 2: Let's see.

95
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,580
Speaker 2: You can't solve an easy problem like this?

96
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,920
Speaker 2: There, all done.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Speaker 2: It's easy when you know how.

98
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,320
Speaker 6: How can you solve a difficult problem like this and not make good grades on your tests?

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,660
Speaker 2: It's because I'm having too much trouble figuring out what the questions are.

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,260
Speaker 2: You mean you can't read the questions in Japanese?

101
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,840
Speaker 2: That's right. I still haven't learned all of the kanji yet.

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,120
Speaker 2: I didn't have to study it in college.

103
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,500
Speaker 2: You went to college?

104
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,140
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated last year.

105
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,600
Speaker 2: So, what does this one say?

106
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,560
Speaker 2: It's a question about

107
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
Speaker 7: thermal expansion.

108
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,980
Speaker 2: Thermal expansion? Oh man, that's kid stuff.

109
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Speaker 2: To put it in terms you'll understand, most things expand when they get hot and contract when they get cold.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,820
Speaker 2: Well, it sounds

111
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,420
Speaker 1: simple enough.

112
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,780
Speaker 1: Look,

113
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,420
Speaker 2: if I were to warm up my breasts with my hands, do you think they'd grow bigger or smaller?

114
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,120
Speaker 2: I don't know. I don't think about things like that.

115
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,220
Speaker 2: Such a boring little boy.

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Speaker 2: Oh.

117
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,220
Speaker 2: Hurry!

118
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,460
Speaker 9: This just isn't clear enough.

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Speaker 9: But the report from the Mount Asuma Earthquake Research Lab

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,880
Speaker 9: implies we should take a closer look at this shadow.

121
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,040
Speaker 9: We can't ignore it.

122
00:06:59,720 --> 00:06:59,880
Speaker 9: What

123
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,800
Speaker 8: do the Magi say?

124
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,820
Speaker 5: It's 50/50 odds.

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,080
Speaker 9: Who's up there?

126
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,080
Speaker 9: Katsuragi has already arrived at the site.

127
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,040
Speaker 9: Ma'am, you're going too deep?

128
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,540
Speaker 4: Thin the probe down another 500.

129
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,740
Speaker 4: Depth, 1200.

130
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,060
Speaker 4: The pressure-resistant partition is cracking.

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,660
Speaker 4: That's Katsuragi.

132
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,540
Speaker 4: If it breaks, we'll pay for the damage.

133
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Speaker 4: 200 more, please.

134
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,820
Speaker 5: We're monitoring a reaction.

135
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,780
Speaker 4: Start analysis.

136
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,100
Speaker 5: Right.

137
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,180
Speaker 4: The probe has imploded due to the extreme pressure.

138
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,440
Speaker 4: Did you get it?

139
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,620
Speaker 10: Just barely. The pattern is blue.

140
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Speaker 4: Then there's no doubt. It's an angel.

141
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,800
Speaker 4: This laboratory is now under the jurisdiction of Nerve.

142
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,820
Speaker 4: There will be no unauthorized phone calls.

143
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,180
Speaker 4: Any access to the outside world is prohibited, and all records pertaining to these events will be classified top secret.

144
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,580
Speaker 4: Katsuragi here. I need an A-17 from Commander Ikari, top priority.

145
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,180
Speaker 9: Watch what you're saying, Captain. This isn't a secure line.

146
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,520
Speaker 4: I know that. Switch me to a scramble line immediately.

147
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,540
Speaker 4: An A-17? You want to make an offensive attack?

148
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,620
Speaker 4: That is correct.

149
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,040
Speaker 4: No, it's too dangerous. Have you forgotten

150
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Speaker 11: what happened 15 years ago?

151
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,979
Speaker 11: No, but consider this. This is our chance to move from a state of perpetual defense to an offensive posture.

152
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,880
Speaker 11: The risk would be enormous.

153
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,240
Speaker 11: However, I'm sure that you must be aware of how important it is to obtain a living angel as a sample, am I correct?

154
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,480
Speaker 11: We will not tolerate failure.

155
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,720
Speaker 9: Failure. If we fail, it will result in the extinction of the entire human race.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,620
Speaker 9: Are you really going to do it, Commander?

157
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,020
Speaker 8: Is that an angel?

158
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,560
Speaker 8: Yes, it's some sort of chrysalis form that precedes the adult stage we're familiar with.

159
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,540
Speaker 8: This operation's prime objective will be to capture this angel.

160
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,780
Speaker 8: We must capture it alive and in a form as close to its original state as possible.

161
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,940
Speaker 8: And if we fail?

162
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,680
Speaker 8: Then you must destroy it immediately.

163
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,380
Speaker 8: Understood?

164
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,080
Speaker 8: Roger!

165
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
Speaker 8: The designated pilot

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,880
Speaker 2: will be...

167
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
Speaker 2: Oh, take me, please! I love to go

168
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,540
Speaker 8: diving!

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,380
Speaker 8: It's going to be me,

170
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,320
Speaker 1: as always.

171
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,260
Speaker 2: Asuka.

172
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:24,900
Speaker 8: Huh?

173
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,720
Speaker 8: You will carry out the mission.

174
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
Speaker 2: Sure! It's gonna be

175
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,700
Speaker 8: easy!

176
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,200
Speaker 8: And me?

177
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,200
Speaker 8: The special equipment we'll be using hasn't been standardized for use in the prototype.

178
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,640
Speaker 8: Ray and Unit Zero will remain here on standby.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,480
Speaker 8: I see.

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,780
Speaker 8: Oh, poor

181
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,200
Speaker 2: little Ray. She doesn't get to have any fun.

182
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,600
Speaker 8: Now that an A-17 has been ordered, we've got to roll out immediately. Get ready.

183
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,320
Speaker 8: Roger.

184
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,820
Speaker 2: Huh? You know, this heat-resistant entry-plug suit doesn't seem any different from our regular ones.

185
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,040
Speaker 2: Press the switch on your right wrist.

186
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,620
Speaker 2: Okay.

187
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,540
Speaker 2: Oh,

188
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,100
Speaker 8: what?!

189
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm

190
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:29,780
Speaker 2: I'm

191
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,080
Speaker 3: so disappointed.

192
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,520
Speaker 3: I was looking forward to seeing you in action.

193
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,700
Speaker 3: He's there behind

194
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,720
Opa-loopa!

195
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,680
Speaker 2: Dr. Akagi, I just can't let Kashi see me in this awful looking thing!

196
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,580
Speaker 2: Are we having problems down there?

197
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,700
Speaker 8: Sort of, yes.

198
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,820
Speaker 8: Excuse me, but I could...

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,340
Speaker 8: I will go in Unit 2.

200
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,220
Speaker 2: Oh no, you don't!

201
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,300
Speaker 2: The only way you're using my Unit 2 is over my dead body!

202
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,940
Speaker 2: I'd rather do it than let her take my place!

203
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Leapkin. They made me do it!

204
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,520
Speaker 4: AVA Units 1 and 2 have arrived.

205
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,680
Speaker 4: Have both units stand by. Reposition the laser board and stand ready on the crane.

206
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,220
Speaker 1: Roger.

207
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,500
Speaker 4: Hey,

208
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,020
Speaker 2: is Kaji here yet?

209
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
Speaker 4: God's gift won't be coming. He's got no business here.

210
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,580
Speaker 2: No, but I wanted him to see me in my greatest triumph to date.

211
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,820
Speaker 7: An A-17 has been ordered. This will include a freeze of all assets.

212
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,540
Speaker 3: So that means that some people will be in trouble.

213
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,380
Speaker 7: Why didn't you try to stop them?

214
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,420
Speaker 3: I had no way of stopping this. This order was an official one, you know.

215
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,260
Speaker 7: But you must know that if Nerve fails at this, the entire world will perish.

216
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,000
Speaker 3: Don't worry. Not even they are that arrogant.

217
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,840
Speaker 1: What are those jets?

218
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,300
Speaker 8: The UN and the Air Force will be standing by. Until this mission's over, anyway.

219
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,140
Speaker 8: Are they here to help us?

220
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,120
Speaker 8: No. They're here to clean up the mess. Just in case we fail.

221
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,120
Speaker 2: What do you mean?

222
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,420
Speaker 8: They'll use N2 depth charges to destroy the Angel. And us as well.

223
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,840
Speaker 8: This job sucks!

224
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,680
Speaker 8: What kind of

225
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,200
Speaker 10: a jerk would order something like that?

226
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,380
Speaker 8: Commander Ikari.

227
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:25,860
Huh?

228
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,740
Speaker 5: Laser operation complete.

229
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,460
Speaker 3: The board path has been secured.

230
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
Speaker 5: The Type-D equipment is functioning

231
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,460
normally.

232
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,880
Unit 2 is ready and in position.

233
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,960
Speaker 4: Understood. Asuka, are you ready?

234
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,540
Speaker 4: Ready when you are.

235
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,920
Speaker 4: Let's do it!

236
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,580
Speaker 2: Oh man, talk about hot.

237
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:01,600
Speaker 2: Unit

238
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,780
Speaker 5: two is entering the lava.

239
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,920
Speaker 2: Hey, look at this Shinji.

240
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,360
Speaker 2: Huh?

241
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,720
Speaker 2: A perfect inner dive.

242
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:22,020
Speaker 2: Depth 170. Rate of descent 20. No problems detected. Visibility is zero.

243
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,260
Speaker 2: I can't see a thing. Switching to CT monitor.

244
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,260
Speaker 2: Even with this I can barely see a thing.

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:41,680
Speaker 5: Depth is 400. 450. 500. 550. 600. 650.

246
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,340
Speaker 5: 900, 950, 1000, 1050.

247
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,520
Speaker 5: We're over the maximum safety depth.

248
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,200
Speaker 5: Depth is 1300.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
Speaker 5: Unit has reached estimated target level.

250
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,920
Speaker 4: Asuka, what do you see?

251
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,520
Speaker 4: I'm not detecting anything.

252
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,600
Speaker 4: It's not here.

253
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,860
Speaker 8: The lava currents must be faster than we

254
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,140
Speaker 4: thought.

255
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,020
Speaker 8: The target's velocity certainly doesn't match our predictions.

256
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,920
Speaker 4: Hurry up and recalculate.

257
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,720
Speaker 4: Descend further. Continue the operation.

258
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,320
Speaker 4: Huh?

259
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
Speaker 4: Depth is 1350.

260
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,140
1400.

261
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,100
Speaker 4: A crack has occurred on the second coolant pipe.

262
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,580
Speaker 4: Depth is 1480.

263
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,340
Speaker 5: We have exceeded the maximum allowed depth.

264
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,940
Speaker 4: But we haven't made contact with the target yet.

265
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,200
Speaker 4: Keep going.

266
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,740
Speaker 4: How's it going, Asuka?

267
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,140
Speaker 4: Nice and toasty. I just want to finish this and take a shower.

268
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,920
Speaker 4: There's a nice hot spring near here. We'll go there once this is over. Just hang in there a little

269
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,260
Speaker 5: longer.

270
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,460
Speaker 5: Maximum allowed depth plus 120.

271
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,020
Speaker 5: Ava Unit 2 has lost its progressive knife. Maximum allowed depth plus 200.

272
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,920
Speaker 5: Captain Katsuragi, you've got to stop this. Have you

273
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,960
Speaker 4: forgotten that there's a human

274
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,300
Speaker 12: being

275
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,720
Speaker 4: in there?

276
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,740
Speaker 4: I will manage this operation as I see fit. Continue to descend.

277
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,620
Speaker 4: I agree with Misato. I'm okay. I can go on.

278
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,380
Speaker 5: Depth 1780. Unit has reached the corrected target depth.

279
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,960
Speaker 5: Wait. I see it.

280
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Speaker 4: The target is

281
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,760
Speaker 3: in sight.

282
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,480
Speaker 13: Prepare for capture.

283
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,680
Speaker 8: All right, because of the convection current that's moving both you and the target, you'll have

284
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,960
Speaker 13: just one chance to make contact.

285
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,200
Speaker 13: I understand. Just leave it to me.

286
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,100
Speaker 9: 30 meters to contact.

287
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,360
Speaker 13: Relative velocity 2.2 on the axis.

288
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,160
Speaker 13: The electromagnetic cage has been spread. No problems detected. The target has been captured.

289
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,560
Speaker 4: Nice work, Asuka.

290
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,660
Speaker 2: The operation is completed. I'm beginning my ascent.

291
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,600
Speaker 2: Oscar, are you alright?

292
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,580
Speaker 2: Well, of course I am. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. This was easy.

293
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,360
Speaker 2: Man, this isn't an entry plug suit. It's a sauna bath.

294
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,860
Speaker 2: Oh, I just want to go and take a cold shower.

295
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,740
Speaker 8: Sounds like the tension let loose all at once.

296
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,620
Speaker 8: Yeah.

297
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaker 8: Were you scared about this operation?

298
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,980
Speaker 8: I sure was.

299
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,240
Speaker 4: Well, yeah.

300
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,420
Speaker 4: If something had gone wrong, it could have been another--

301
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,020
Speaker 8: I know.

302
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,440
Speaker 8: Second impact.

303
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,320
Speaker 8: All over again.

304
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,020
It's going crazy!

305
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,460
Speaker 10: Oh, no!

306
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,860
Speaker 10: It started to hatch!

307
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,420
Speaker 10: It's earlier than we predicted!

308
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,860
Speaker 10: Cage status!

309
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,760
Speaker 10: There's no way it can

310
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,360
Speaker 3: handle this!

311
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,980
Speaker 4: Abort the capture! Jettison the cage!

312
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,600
Speaker 4: Damn!

313
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,380
Speaker 4: We're changing the operation. We've got to destroy that angel.

314
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,680
Speaker 4: Unit 2, prepare for combat!

315
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,939
Speaker 4: Do it, Oscar!

316
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,079
Speaker 4: You got it!

317
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,339
Speaker 2: Damn it! I forgot that I dropped the frog knife!

318
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,040
Speaker 2: The angel!

319
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,620
Speaker 2: Releasing holster!

320
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,140
Speaker 2: It's fast!

321
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,720
Speaker 2: This is no

322
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,180
Speaker 1: good.

323
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,580
Speaker 12: I've

324
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,280
Speaker 2: lost it again.

325
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,980
Speaker 2: And if this lousy visibility wasn't bad enough,

326
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,900
Speaker 2: I'm also too hot in this disgusting suit stuck to my body with sweat.

327
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,140
Speaker 2: This really sucks.

328
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,300
Speaker 4: Asuka!

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,340
Speaker 4: We're going to drop you Unit 1's progressive knife.

330
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,280
Speaker 4: Stand ready.
