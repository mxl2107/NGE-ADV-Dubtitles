1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,700
Speaker 1: The young man like a bad guy

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,700
Speaker 1: You're a young man, you're a fairy tale

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,880
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now on the door

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at you, I'm

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,760
Speaker 1: The way to the future is to be a place for the future

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,780
Speaker 1: A sad thing that is being made by the end of the world

7
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,400
Speaker 1: From the window to the end of the world

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,540
Speaker 1: A hot-past-taste of the day and the day of the world

9
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,480
Speaker 1: I will be afraid of the world

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,880
Speaker 1: This world will shine

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,120
Speaker 1: You are a man, you are a fairy tale

12
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,580
*Sigh*

13
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:02,220
Speaker 2: Is that you dead?

14
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Speaker 3: *Sounds of

15
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,860
Speaker 3: - Yeah, she's got a tough job.

16
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,980
Speaker 3: Well then, I guess we've gotta be quiet

17
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,700
Speaker 3: so that we don't wake Masato up, right?

18
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,020
Speaker 3: - Well... - Shh!

19
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,920
Speaker 4: - Hey!

20
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Speaker 5: -

21
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Speaker 5: - What

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,500
Speaker 4: the heck are these creeps doing in

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,880
Speaker 5: here?

24
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,960
Speaker 5: - Shh! - Drying themselves?

25
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,740
Speaker 4: - Oh, sure. Talk about lame excuses!

26
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Speaker 4: Well, I'm changing in here, and if you peep, you're dead!

27
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,580
Speaker 3: - You stuck-up, beacotistical little dude wanna watch a snake

28
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,020
Speaker 3: changing its skin anyway!

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,460
Speaker 3: - She's sure full of herself.

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,240
Speaker 3: - Miss Sato, did we wake you up?

31
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,080
Speaker 2: - Actually, I was already awake.

32
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,240
Speaker 2: Thanks for asking though.

33
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,060
Speaker 2: Shinji, don't forget that we're having a harmonics test

34
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,100
Speaker 2: at the lab this evening.

35
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,420
Speaker 2: - Right. - Hey Asuka, did you hear that?

36
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Speaker 2: - Yes ma'am.

37
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,600
Speaker 3: - Huh?

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,900
Speaker 3: Wow! I mean, congratulations on your promotion, Miss Sato.

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,880
Speaker 3: - Yeah, congratulations.

40
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,820
Speaker 2: - You're too kind.

41
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,760
Speaker 3: - No ma'am, you deserved it.

42
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,420
Speaker 2: - Well, I'll see you guys later.

43
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,440
Speaker 2: - I'll see you later. - I'll see you later.

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,640
Speaker 5: - Have fun! See ya!

45
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,560
Speaker 5: - So what's up? Did something happen to Misato?

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,900
Speaker 3: - Haven't you seen her new badge?

47
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,700
Speaker 3: It's got two stripes on it now.

48
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,080
Speaker 3: Two stripes means that she's been promoted to major.

49
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,940
Speaker 4: - Promoted? I didn't notice.

50
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,740
Speaker 3: - Yeah, me neither.

51
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,320
Speaker 3: - Neither of you noticed? What a bunch of lame-os.

52
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,160
Speaker 6: - Man,

53
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,820
Speaker 3: don't you guys ever pay attention

54
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,440
Speaker 3: to that poor, hard-working woman.

55
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
Speaker 3: Do you have any idea of how hard it must be

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,400
Speaker 3: to take care of the two of you at her age?

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,420
Speaker 3: - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,940
Speaker 3: I guess it's a good thing that some of us still have a little human compassion.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,920
Speaker 7: Units 0 and 2 are both on the edge of the contamination zone. They've reached their limit.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,880
Speaker 7: Unit 1 can still tolerate a little more though, can't he? Lower the graph depth another 0.3.

61
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,680
Speaker 7: He's almost reached the contamination zone.

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,380
Speaker 7: And he's still getting these readings?

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,920
Speaker 7: He's just wonderful.

64
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,480
Speaker 7: His harmonics and sync ratio are rapidly catching up with Asuka's.

65
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,620
Speaker 7: He does have talent, doesn't he?

66
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,040
Speaker 7: It's as if he was born to become a Nava pilot, isn't it?

67
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,460
Speaker 2: But that's not what Shinji wants.

68
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,720
Speaker 2: I know he's not really happy here.

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,420
Speaker 7: The test has been completed.

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,240
Speaker 7: That was excellent work, Shinji.

71
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,200
Speaker 7: What do you mean?

72
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,160
Speaker 7: Your harmonics value has increased by

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 4: 8 points since the last test.

74
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,760
Speaker 4: That's very good.

75
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
Speaker 4: But it's still 50 points below mine.

76
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,600
Speaker 4: That's true, but 8 points in 10 days is amazing.

77
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,340
Speaker 4: I don't think it's so great!

78
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,940
Speaker 4: Okay, third child, enjoy your victory while you can.

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,160
Speaker 4: I'll see you when you get home, jerkface.

80
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,480
Speaker 4: And here's

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,200
the missing from Mr. Wild!

82
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,280
Oh, by the way, it's nice that you got promoted.

83
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 5: Thanks, Shinji.

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,820
Speaker 5: But to tell you the truth, I'm not really all that thrilled with it.

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,000
Speaker 5: Oh, I understand.

86
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,280
Speaker 5: I'm not crazy about getting praised in public either,

87
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,200
Speaker 5: especially when it's like earlier today.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
Speaker 5: All it did was make Asuka angry.

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,660
Speaker 5: Why does she get so pissed off?

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,660
Speaker 5: It's so stupid.

91
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,200
Speaker 2: It bothers you, doesn't it?

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,200
Speaker 2: It does.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,940
Speaker 2: Well, that's because you think too much about what others think of you.

94
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,900
Speaker 5: Congratulations!

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,260
Speaker 3: Way

96
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,120
Speaker 2: to go, Misato!

97
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,740
Speaker 2: Thanks, you guys.

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,880
Speaker 2: And thank you, Toji.

99
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,600
Speaker 3: No, no, this was Kensuke's idea.

100
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,420
Speaker 3: That's right! I, Kensuke Ida, am the mastermind behind this dinner.

101
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,200
Speaker 3: Oh, well then thank you, Mr. Ida.

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,380
Speaker 3: Oh, it was no problem. It wasn't such a big deal, really.

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,760
Speaker 3: Hey, by the way, just what is Hikari doing here?

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
Speaker 4: I invited her, Doomkopf!

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,640
Speaker 4: YAAA!

106
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Speaker 4: Did you invite Rei too?

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,220
Speaker 4: Well, I invited her, but she's not exactly the party type, you know?

108
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Speaker 4: Darn, why is Kaji so late?

109
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,620
Speaker 4: Kaji? You mean that really cool looking guy who never shaves?

110
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,280
Speaker 4: Yeah, after hanging around these dorks all day, it's nice to know what a real man is like.

111
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,380
Speaker 4: So kiddo, is it still difficult for you to

112
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,720
Speaker 5: be in this kind of situation?

113
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,800
Speaker 5: I'm okay. I'm just not used to being around so many people.

114
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,180
Speaker 3: Oh, you get out of here. What do you think you're doing?

115
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,740
Speaker 5: Why do they have to be so nosy?

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Why don't you just go home?

117
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Just go back where you came. Where'd you come from, Mars?

118
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,360
Speaker 5: Your promotion.

119
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,140
Speaker 5: That means that someone must appreciate the kind of work you've been doing, right?

120
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,260
Speaker 5: Yeah, I suppose so.

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,020
Speaker 5: That's why they're all so happy for you.

122
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,460
Speaker 2: But you don't look very happy at all.

123
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,760
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm happy. But that's not the reason I do what I do.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,400
Speaker 5: So why did you join Nerve?

125
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,900
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know. It's been a long time since I signed up,

126
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,300
Speaker 8: you know.

127
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,140
Speaker 4: Why don't you just get the hell out of here before I do it?

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,660
Speaker 4: And I'll shove you with a second

129
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,020
Speaker 8: line.

130
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,400
Speaker 4: That's gotta be Kaji!

131
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,940
Speaker 8: I came directly from headquarters. We just happened to meet on the way.

132
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,620
Speaker 7: A likely story.

133
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,000
Speaker 7: You're not jealous, are you?

134
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,780
Speaker 7: Hm, absolutely not.

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,160
Speaker 8: I'd like to give you my sincerest regards, Major Katsuragi.

136
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,220
Speaker 8: I suppose I'll have to be polite to you from now on.

137
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,360
Speaker 2: Hm, and just what does that mean?

138
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,700
Speaker 2: Well,

139
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,020
Speaker 8: you know that Commanders Ikari and Fiyutsuki have never left Japan at the same time before.

140
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,640
Speaker 8: I guess they must really feel old Katsuragi here's dependable.

141
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,440
Speaker 7: My father's left Japan again?

142
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,520
Speaker 7: That's right, Shinji. He's at the South Pole.

143
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,000
Speaker 9: Once this was a living continent of Antarctica.

144
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,760
Speaker 9: Now it's an ocean of death.

145
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,080
Speaker 9: The Pole, not just another name for Hell.

146
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
Speaker 10: Nevertheless, mankind has returned to this wasteland.

147
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,340
Speaker 10: In the midst of death, we still

148
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,860
Speaker 1: live.

149
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,060
Speaker 10: That's because we're under

150
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,260
Speaker 9: the protection of science.

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,580
Speaker 9: Science is what makes man powerful.

152
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,240
Speaker 9: That kind of self-righteous arrogance

153
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,880
Speaker 9: is what caused the tragedy of 15 years ago, the second impact.

154
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,180
Speaker 9: And here, before us, is the end result.

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,040
Speaker 9: This is a far greater punishment than mankind deserved.

156
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,840
Speaker 9: This is the real Dead Sea.

157
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,180
Speaker 11: Yet this is a world that has been purified and purged of the original sin.

158
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,080
Speaker 11: I'd rather live in a world with people, no matter how stained this is.

159
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,860
Speaker 3: This is the bridge. We've just received a telex from Nerve Headquarters.

160
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,920
Speaker 3: An angel has been

161
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,860
Speaker 12: detected in orbit

162
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,380
Speaker 8: above the

163
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,940
Speaker 12: Indian Ocean.

164
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,160
Speaker 8: The angel appeared about two minutes ago.

165
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,860
Speaker 12: Send recon satellite number six to that orbit.

166
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,660
Speaker 8: T-minus two minutes to contact.

167
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,020
Speaker 8: The target has been sighted.

168
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,320
Speaker 2: It's enormous!

169
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,340
Speaker 2: It's impressive, all right.

170
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,400
Speaker 3: Recon 6 is now in range.

171
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,980
Speaker 12: Commencing data search.

172
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,680
Speaker 12: Commencing data transmission.

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,520
Speaker 12: Data transmission complete.

174
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,060
Speaker 2: Was that

175
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,780
Speaker 7: an AT field?

176
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,740
Speaker 7: Yes, a new way of using one.

177
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,180
Speaker 2: Look at the size of that tidal wave.

178
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,540
Speaker 2: That's an AT field impact.

179
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,840
Speaker 2: It uses

180
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,920
Speaker 7: kinetic energy, too.

181
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,160
Speaker 7: This angel is like a huge living bomb.

182
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,200
Speaker 7: At least the first blast missed and hit the ocean.

183
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,780
Speaker 7: However, the second shot hit closer to land,

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
Speaker 7: and for the last two hours it's been steadily correcting its error ratio.

185
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,840
Speaker 7: So it's learning to aim itself.

186
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,420
Speaker 2: We detonated

187
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,820
Speaker 8: an N2 aerial mine on it.

188
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,760
Speaker 8: No effect.

189
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,700
Speaker 8: The angel has been hiding since then.

190
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,020
Speaker 7: It's coming here, isn't it?

191
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,520
Speaker 7: It's a safe bet.

192
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,120
Speaker 7: And if it falls on us...

193
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,200
Speaker 7: Then there'll be a third Ashinoka Lake, right?

194
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,140
Speaker 7: Actually, this whole area will become an extension of the Pacific Ocean.

195
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,520
Speaker 7: Can we contact Commander Ikari?

196
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,640
Speaker 11: It's impossible. We can't get through the Angels' jamming.

197
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Speaker 2: What about the Magi?

198
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,660
Speaker 2: The Magi are unanimous in recommending evacuation.

199
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,520
Speaker 2: What will you do?

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
Speaker 7: You're the one who's in charge of all this now.

201
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,260
Speaker 2: Notify all the ministries concerned that I am issuing a special D-17 declaration.

202
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,400
Speaker 2: All residents within a radius of 50 kilometers are to evacuate immediately.

203
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,320
Speaker 2: Also, tell Matsushiro to back up the Magi.

204
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,020
Speaker 8: Are we going to evacuate as well?

205
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,440
Speaker 2: No, but it's not necessary to place everyone here at risk.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,520
Speaker 2: Your attention, please. The government has announced a D-17 special declaration of emergency for this area.

207
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,740
Speaker 2: All residents must evacuate to their designated locations.

208
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,220
Speaker 12: Beginning with the blocks 6 and 7, evacuate according to the directions of your district chief immediately.

209
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,060
Speaker 8: The evacuation of the city is now complete.

210
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,460
Speaker 12: The evacuation of all non-combatant and D-class personnel by Alarm C has been completed.

211
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,000
Speaker 7: You're not really serious, are you?

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
Speaker 7: Yes, I am.

213
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,700
Speaker 7: You're willing to sacrifice all three Avas to satisfy your own ambitions?

214
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,400
Speaker 7: The chance of success is 0.001%.

215
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,940
Speaker 7: Just one in 10,000.

216
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,000
Speaker 2: Well, it's not zero. I just trust the Avas.

217
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
Speaker 2: Major Katsuragi, don't forget that I'm the one in charge now.

218
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,160
Speaker 2: I have to do what I have

219
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,560
Speaker 7: to do.

220
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,840
Speaker 7: Destroying the Angels is my duty.

221
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,940
Speaker 7: Your duty? You must be kidding.

222
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Speaker 7: This is to satisfy yourself, isn't it?

223
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,260
Speaker 7: This is just your revenge against the Angels.

224
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,020
Speaker 4: What? You want us to catch it with our hands?

225
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,280
Speaker 2: That's right.

226
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,960
Speaker 2: We'll locate the Avas in the estimated drop zone.

227
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,640
Speaker 2: Then, while maintaining your AT fields, you'll catch it before it hits the ground.

228
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,940
Speaker 2: But what if it doesn't fall where you think it will?

229
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,360
Speaker 2: Then there'll be a little boom.

230
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,680
Speaker 2: But what if the Avas can't handle the impact?

231
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,300
Speaker 2: We'll all be blown to the moon.

232
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,520
Speaker 2: What are our chances?

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,900
Speaker 2: I've got no idea.

234
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,600
Speaker 2: Not so good, in my opinion.

235
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,740
Speaker 2: If we pull this off, it'll be a miracle.

236
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,060
Speaker 2: Miracles aren't something that just happen.

237
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,780
Speaker 2: They're something that people make happen.

238
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,240
Speaker 2: We've got to be willing to sacrifice ourselves.

239
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Aska. We've got no other choice. This is the best plan.

240
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,100
Speaker 2: How can you call something this crazy a plan?

241
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,340
Speaker 2: I suppose I can't, really. You can refuse to do it if you wish.

242
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,940
Speaker 2: I see. So you are okay with this?

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,700
Speaker 2: The regulations state here that you're all supposed to write out a will. Have you done that yet?

244
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,740
Speaker 2: I don't need to write one. I'm not going to die just yet.

245
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,460
Speaker 2: Neither do I. There's no point to it.

246
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,480
Speaker 2: Yeah, me neither.

247
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,580
Speaker 2: Okay, but when all of this is over, I'll treat all of you to a steak dinner, okay?

248
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,220
Speaker 2: A steak dinner?

249
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:40,860
Speaker 2: Yep.

250
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,720
Speaker 2: Wow.

251
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,220
Speaker 2: You won't forget, right?

252
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,680
Speaker 2: I swear I won't.

253
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,800
Speaker 5: A steak dinner is supposed to impress us?

254
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,780
Speaker 4: Does she really think we'd go crazy just for a dumb steak dinner?

255
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,860
Speaker 4: Man, the second impact generation has really got some cheap standards.

256
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,140
Speaker 5: I suppose she just

257
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,880
Speaker 4: can't help it.

258
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,940
Speaker 4: Well, that "wow" you made sounded pretty enthusiastic to me, Shinji.

259
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,740
Speaker 5: Well, it may not mean much to us, but it still means something to her, you know?

260
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,340
Speaker 4: I suppose so. Well, let's figure out where she's going to take us.

261
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,600
Speaker 4: Tokyo 3 5-star restaurant directory.

262
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,320
Speaker 4: You're gonna be coming with us, right, First Child?

263
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,580
Speaker 4: I don't think so.

264
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,560
Speaker 4: Why not?

265
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,160
Speaker 4: I dislike eating

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,660
Speaker 2: meat.

267
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,040
Speaker 4: Angel's ECM jamming has caused us to

268
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,840
Speaker 2: lose track of it again.

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,840
Speaker 2: Since it's impossible to calculate the exact location,

270
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,620
Speaker 2: the Magi have estimated a probable drop zone radius from what little data we could collect.

271
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,840
Speaker 2: This is it.

272
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,680
Speaker 2: That's a huge area to cover!

273
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,360
Speaker 7: It could drop on any of these locations?

274
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,120
Speaker 7: Given the size of the target's AT field,

275
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,500
Speaker 7: it could completely annihilate Nerve Headquarters simply by coming close with a near miss.

276
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,760
Speaker 7: So, we'll disperse the Avis so there's one at each of these three points.

277
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,500
Speaker 7: What is this

278
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
Speaker 2: dispersal based on?

279
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:57,960
Speaker 7: A guess.

280
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,600
Speaker 6: A guess?

281
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,300
Speaker 4: It's women's intuition!

282
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,280
Speaker 4: Her woman's intuition looks like our miracle is getting further and further away.

283
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Speaker 5: She plays the lottery a lot, and she never wins either.

284
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,580
Speaker 5: Ew.

285
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,340
Speaker 4: Hey, Asuka.

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,200
Speaker 4: What?

287
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,560
Speaker 4: Why did you become an Eva pilot?

288
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,060
Speaker 4: To show the world how great I am, of course.

289
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,840
Speaker 4: So it's a way of proving that you exist?

290
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,000
Speaker 4: Yeah, I guess you could say that.

291
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,380
Speaker 4: Why don't you ask Wonder Girl?

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
Speaker 4: I've already talked

293
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,980
Speaker 5: with her about it.

294
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,240
Speaker 4: Hmm. So you've been having secret meetings.

295
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,160
Speaker 5: No, it's not like that.

296
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,120
Speaker 4: So why do you do this?

297
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
Speaker 5: I don't know.

298
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,620
Speaker 4: Just what do you mean? Are you

299
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,140
Speaker 5: stupid?

300
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,240
Speaker 4: Maybe I am.

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,360
Speaker 12: Huh.

302
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,980
Speaker 12: I suppose you really are.

303
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,260
Speaker 12: 20 minutes to estimated time of impact.

304
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,660
Speaker 2: The rest of you can leave now. I can take care of this situation.

305
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,560
Speaker 5: Sorry,

306
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,140
Speaker 8: this is our job as well.

307
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,400
Speaker 8: Yeah, we can't let those kids risk their lives all by themselves.

308
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
Speaker 2: Don't worry about the children.

309
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,500
Speaker 2: No matter how badly the Avas might get damaged,

310
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,540
Speaker 2: their AT fields will protect them.

311
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,160
Speaker 2: Actually, the safest place to be right now is inside the Ava.

312
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,380
Speaker 6: The

313
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,960
Speaker 2: other day you wanted to know why I really joined Nerve.

314
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,000
Speaker 2: It began with my father. He lived for his work, to the exclusion of everything else.

315
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,300
Speaker 2: I was never able to forgive him for that. In fact, at times, I even hated him.

316
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,560
Speaker 5: It sounds like my father.

317
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,780
Speaker 2: He never really took care of me or my mother.

318
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,280
Speaker 2: His friends always said that he was too sensitive and fragile, but the truth was, he was just a weak person.

319
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,980
Speaker 2: He didn't want to face reality, so avoiding his family was easier than dealing with it.

320
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,800
Speaker 2: When my mother decided to divorce him, I was actually happy.

321
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,120
Speaker 2: I was so sick of hearing her cry herself to sleep.

322
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,100
Speaker 2: And when my dad got upset about it, I actually laughed at him because I thought he got what he deserved.

323
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,600
Speaker 2: But then he sacrificed himself to save my life during the second impact.

324
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,079
Speaker 2: Then I didn't know whether I hated him or loved him.

325
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,060
Speaker 2: The only thing that was clear to me was that I wanted to destroy the angels who had caused the second impact.

326
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,120
Speaker 2: And that's why I joined Nerve.

327
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,740
Speaker 2: It might be that I still hate him and just want to avenge my father so that I can finally free myself from him.

328
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,000
Speaker 2: It's the only way I can escape.

329
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
Speaker 13: I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

330
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,320
Speaker 2: I won't.

331
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,540
Speaker 3: I won't run away.

332
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,460
Speaker 3: The target has been sighted. Maximum magnification. Distance, approximately 25,000.

333
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:54,640
Speaker 3: The

334
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,340
Speaker 2: Falling Angel's

335
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,400
Speaker 3: been sighted. All Avas, get on your marks.

336
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,680
Speaker 14: We can only give you a rough estimated trajectory based upon optical observations.

337
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,260
Speaker 14: The Magi will guide you until the estimated distance is 10,000 meters.

338
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,320
Speaker 14: After that, you'll have to use your own judgment.

339
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,560
Speaker 14: Remember, I'm placing my trust in you.

340
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,300
Speaker 3: The angel is approaching distance 20,000 right

341
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,700
Speaker 2: begin the operation here we go

342
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,300
Speaker 2: Let's move out

343
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,980
Speaker 3: Distance 12,000

344
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,580
Speaker 2: Spreading AT Field!

345
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,500
Speaker 4: Unit two, expand your field!

346
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,960
Speaker 4: I'm already doing it!

347
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,180
Speaker 4: Do it now!

348
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:31,440
Speaker 6: Exist!

349
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,960
Speaker 6: *Screams*

350
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,460
Speaker 3: Our wireless communications have been restored.

351
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,660
Speaker 3: We're receiving a transmission from Commander Ikari in Antarctica.

352
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,400
Speaker 2: Connect him, please.

353
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,220
Speaker 3: Yes, ma'am.

354
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,740
Speaker 2: I apologize, sir.

355
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,560
Speaker 2: Because of my irresponsible judgment, Unit One has incurred some damage.

356
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,280
Speaker 2: I take full responsibility for this, sir.

357
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 9: No. Destroying Angels isn't Eva's purpose.

358
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,820
Speaker 9: It was fortunate that the amount of damage done was minimal.

359
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,420
Speaker 10: Excellent work, Major Katsuraki.

360
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,180
Speaker 2: Thank you, Commander.

361
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,140
Speaker 2: And on that subject,

362
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,900
Speaker 10: is the pilot of Unit 1 there?

363
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,480
Speaker 10: Yes.

364
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,020
Speaker 10: I've just read the report.

365
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,920
Speaker 10: Good work, Shinji.

366
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,000
Speaker 2: Yes,

367
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,220
Speaker 10: sir.

368
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,820
Speaker 10: Now, Major Kasaragi, I'll leave the handling of the rest of this in your hands.

369
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,740
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.

370
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,180
The next station is new Mianoshita.

371
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,920
New Mianushita. The door will open on the left side of the next question.

372
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,740
Speaker 2: So, now you're going to have to fulfill your promise.

373
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
Speaker 2: Well, of course I will.

374
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,740
Speaker 2: I went and pulled some large bills for my account so that I could cover everything.

375
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,180
Speaker 2: Of course, now I'm broke.

376
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,300
Speaker 4: A ramen place?

377
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,020
Speaker 4: Well, we know how poor you are, Misato.

378
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,420
Speaker 4: This'll be fine.

379
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,520
Speaker 4: And since there's no meat, Wonder Girl will be joining us.

380
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,660
Speaker 2: One garlic ramen with no roast pork.

381
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,200
Speaker 2: I'll

382
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,160
Speaker 4: have shark spin ramen with roast pork.

383
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,020
Speaker 4: Supersize

384
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,180
Speaker 1: it!

385
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,740
Speaker 4: There you go!

386
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,560
Speaker 5: Say, Misato.

387
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:31,680
Speaker 5: Yeah?

388
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,260
Speaker 5: I think I finally understood the good part about being praised by someone when I heard my father's words today.

389
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:45,500
Speaker 5: And I also realized that the reason I pilot my Eva is to hear those words from him.

390
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,680
Speaker 4: Now, wait a second. That's why you're a pilot?

391
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,620
Speaker 4: Jeez, you really are an idiot.

392
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,200
Speaker 4: Hmm.

393
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,160
Speaker 15: In other words, darling kiss me

394
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,020
Speaker 15: Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore

395
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,860
Speaker 15: You are all I know for all I worship and adore

396
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,020
Speaker 15: In other words, please be true.

397
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,840
Speaker 15: In other words,

398
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,900
I love you.

399
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
Speaker 2: The Magi, the trio of supercomputers that command all of Nerve headquarters, are under attack.

400
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,400
Speaker 2: As problems mount and central dogma is invaded, Nerve is forced to accept a course of self-destruction.

401
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,340
Speaker 2: It all happens in the next episode.

402
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,420
Speaker 2: Angel invasion.
