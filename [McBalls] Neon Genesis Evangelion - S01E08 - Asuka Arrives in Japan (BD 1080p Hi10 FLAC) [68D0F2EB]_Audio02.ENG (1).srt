1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,680
Speaker 1: The young man like a young man

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,680
Speaker 1: You are a young man, you are a fairy tale

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,560
Speaker 1: The wind is now on the door, but I just see you, I'm smiling.

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,740
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to see you, but I'm so happy to see you.

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:00,140
Speaker 1: But I'll tell you that I'll find the way behind

6
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,860
Speaker 1: I will be shining in the sky

7
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,100
Speaker 1: I will be a fairy tale

8
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,980
Speaker 2: Correct. I have already made the necessary arrangements with the committee.

9
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,720
Speaker 2: The cargo left port yesterday. It's making its way over here.

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,180
Speaker 3: Wow! A MiG-55D transport helicopter!

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,480
Speaker 3: I never thought I'd actually get a chance to fly on one of these hot mamas!

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,200
Speaker 3: Man, it's great having a famous buddy like you, right, Shinji?

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,740
Speaker 3: Huh?

14
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,500
Speaker 3: Yeah, I thought you must be getting sick of being cramped up in the mountains,

15
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,900
Speaker 3: So I thought it'd be kinda nice

16
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,080
Speaker 4: to invite you guys to come along with me on this little date.

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,820
Speaker 4: What? Are

18
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,760
Speaker 3: you saying that this is really a date we're having, Misato?

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Speaker 3: And I bought this cap especially for today, just for you.

20
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,340
Speaker 3: I'll never take it off.

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,620
Speaker 3: So, where are we going?

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,800
Speaker 4: Oh, we're just taking a cruise on that cute little boat down there.

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,180
Speaker 3: Oh my god!

24
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,580
Speaker 3: One, two, three, four, five aircraft carriers and four battleships!

25
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,400
Speaker 3: What a fleet!

26
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,860
Speaker 3: That's your cute little boat?

27
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,640
Speaker 3: She's gorgeous! That's the pride of the UN

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,520
Speaker 4: combined fleet,

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,260
Speaker 3: the super carrier over the rainbow!

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,580
Speaker 3: It's enormous.

31
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,980
Speaker 4: Personally, I'm surprised it's such a crusty old relic and still float.

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,520
Speaker 3: Nah, it's not so bad. It's a vintage model from just before the second impact.

33
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,780
Speaker 5: Damn, give me a break. It looks like they've brought the power cables for that children's toy of theirs.

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,040
Speaker 5: Give me a break.

35
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,660
Speaker 3: *Dramatic

36
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,060
Speaker 6: music

37
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,860
Speaker 6: - Stop,

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,180
Speaker 3: damn you! That's

39
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,680
Speaker 3: my special hat! Stop it, someone! Come on,

40
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,420
Speaker 3: stop it!

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,700
Speaker 6: - What?

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,780
Speaker 6: - Well, hello,

43
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,920
Speaker 4: Misato. How have you been? - Just fine. Goodness,

44
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,160
Speaker 4: you've grown some, haven't you? - Uh-huh.

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,700
Speaker 7: And

46
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,620
Speaker 4: I'm not just taller.

47
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,420
Speaker 7: My figure spilled out as well.

48
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,300
Speaker 4: - Let me introduce you. This

49
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,920
Speaker 4: is the designated pilot of Eva

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,400
Speaker 4: Unit 2, the second child, Asuka Langley

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,140
Speaker 4: Soryu.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Speaker 7: *Sigh*

53
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,620
Speaker 5: - Hmm, nerve.

54
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,480
Speaker 5: From your antics on the dick, I was quite sure you were the leader of this Boy Scout troop.

55
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,500
Speaker 5: Obviously, I was mistaken.

56
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,620
Speaker 4: - Thank you for all your gracious hospitality, Admiral.

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,840
Speaker 5: - Oh no, thank you for giving me the opportunity to babysit so many more children.

58
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,780
Speaker 4: - And thank you for your assistance in the marine transport of AVA Unit 2.

59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,540
Speaker 4: Here are the specifications for the emergency power supply.

60
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,980
Speaker 5: Hmph, you've wasted a trip. I'd never approve any request to activate that toy while at sea in the first place.

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,120
Speaker 4: Think of it as being prepared for an emergency. The HAVA is quite valuable, sir.

62
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,060
Speaker 5: So valuable that the entire Pacific Fleet has to be pulled for guard duty?

63
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,360
Speaker 8: Exactly when did the UN recommission us into a bloody cargo service?

64
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,560
Speaker 8: If my memory serves me correctly, it was just after a certain organization was established.

65
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,820
Speaker 8: Guarding a toy? What a ridiculously

66
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,460
Speaker 5: grandiose assignment for the entire Pacific Fleet!

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,240
Speaker 5: It's

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,120
Speaker 4: still not enough. Not when you consider the importance of the EVA.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,980
Speaker 4: Sign these transfer documents, please.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,440
Speaker 4: Not

71
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,820
Speaker 5: yet. EVA Unit

72
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,320
Speaker 4: 2 and

73
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,020
Speaker 5: its pilot have been entrusted to us by the Third Branch in Germany.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,580
Speaker 5: You're just not gonna waltz in and do as you please, Captain Katsuragi.

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,320
Speaker 4: When will you transfer them to us?

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Speaker 5: Once we've unloaded in New Yokosuka.

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,780
Speaker 5: The ocean is our jurisdiction. You will follow our orders here.

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,260
Speaker 4: I understand. However, I should remind you that in an emergency,

79
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 4: Nerves military authority overrides your own.

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,700
Speaker 4: She's awesome.

81
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,700
Speaker 4: She sounds just like Ritsuko.

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,140
Speaker 4: Kaji!

83
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,780
Speaker 5: Mr. Kaji, I

84
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,740
Speaker 4: must insist that

85
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,720
Speaker 5: you stop inviting yourself onto the bridge.

86
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,840
Speaker 5: Oh, sorry about that.

87
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,840
Speaker 4: Please excuse

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,200
Speaker 6: us.

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,420
Speaker 4: Transport us

90
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,340
Speaker 6: to new Yoko Suka as order.

91
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,640
Speaker 8: Damn, those children are mankind's salvation?

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Speaker 8: I suppose the times are changing, sir.

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,320
Speaker 8: I understand that Congress has pinned its hopes on that robot as well.

94
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,260
Speaker 8: On that child's plaything? What idiots!

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Speaker 5: If they've got the money to blow on that, they ought to give us a little more.

96
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,420
Speaker 4: What are you doing here?

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Speaker 5: Accompanying

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,300
Speaker 9: her. I'm on a business trip of sorts.

99
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,200
Speaker 4: Talk about careless. I should have anticipated something like this.

100
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,440
Speaker 4: Hey! Watch

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,560
Speaker 6: where

102
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,200
Speaker 7: you're touching!

103
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,320
Speaker 6: I can't help

104
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,680
Speaker 9: it!

105
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,540
Speaker 9: Hmm.

106
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,220
Speaker 9: So, do you have a boyfriend right now?

107
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,500
Speaker 4: I don't think that's any of your business, is it?

108
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,860
Speaker 9: I'm hurt.

109
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,640
Speaker 9: Ow.

110
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,840
Speaker 9: So, I understand that you're living with Katsuragi.

111
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,120
Speaker 4: Uh, yeah?

112
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,340
Speaker 9: Tell me something.

113
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,940
Speaker 9: Is she still so wild in bed?

114
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,020
Speaker 9: What?

115
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:01,620
Speaker 4: What?

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,260
Speaker 4: What?

117
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,500
Speaker 4: What are you

118
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,760
Speaker 10: implying by that?

119
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,120
Speaker 9: No, she hasn't changed at all, has she, Shinji?

120
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,860
Speaker 10: Um, I guess.

121
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,140
Speaker 10: But how did you know what my name was?

122
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,820
Speaker 9: Well, I ought to know you.

123
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,680
Speaker 9: You're pretty famous in the defense business, you know.

124
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,380
Speaker 9: The famous third child who piloted an Eva in his first battle with no training.

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,380
Speaker 9: Oh, that.

126
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,040
Speaker 4: I was just lucky.

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,740
Speaker 9: Luck is a part of your destiny. It's your talent.

128
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,940
Speaker 9: Well, I'll see you later.

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,480
Speaker 7: Okay.

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,600
Speaker 7: It's a bad dream. It's a nightmare.

131
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,920
Speaker 9: So, what do you think about Shinji Ikari?

132
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
Speaker 7: Oh, the great third child.

133
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,240
Speaker 7: He's boring.

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,740
Speaker 9: And yet, his synchronization ratio was well over 40% in combat with no prior training.

135
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,520
Speaker 9: My God!

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,040
Speaker 9: That admiral's attitude gets on my nerves.

137
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,120
Speaker 4: He's full of himself, all right.

138
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,520
Speaker 4: Too much pride's bound to make him cynical.

139
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,720
Speaker 4: That Mr. Kaji is pretty, um,

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,800
Speaker 9: interesting.

141
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,760
Speaker 7: He hasn't changed at all, that chauvinistic pig!

142
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,060
Speaker 7: Hey, third child.

143
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,900
Speaker 7: You're coming with me.

144
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,940
*Squeak*

145
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
Speaker 7: That's really an interesting color. I didn't know it was red.

146
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,080
Speaker 7: That's not all that's different about Unit 2.

147
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Speaker 7: Uh-huh.

148
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,860
Speaker 7: Unit 0 and 1 were the prototype and test type respectively.

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 7: The fact that Unit 1 synchronized with an untrained pilot like you is proof of that.

150
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,060
Speaker 7: However, Unit 2 is a little different.

151
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,419
Speaker 7: My Unit 2 is the world's first real Evangelion!

152
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,360
Speaker 7: Created for actual combat conditions, it's the final production model!

153
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,700
Speaker 7: What

154
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,860
Speaker 6: was that? An explosion?

155
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,100
Speaker 6: Undersea shockwave!

156
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,240
Speaker 7: And it sounded close! Look!

157
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,780
Speaker 7: What's that?

158
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,280
Speaker 7: It can't be... angels!

159
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,480
Speaker 7: Angels? You mean a real one?

160
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,320
Speaker 7: This is really bad. We've got to go back and find Misato.

161
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,780
Speaker 7: Oondava.

162
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,200
Speaker 8: All ships, head out and take evasive actions.

163
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,500
Speaker 8: Radio room, status report.

164
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,960
Speaker 8: The silver lanes got silent. Titus Andronicus can't locate the target.

165
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,260
Speaker 8: The Biloxi Blues is taking in

166
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,440
Speaker 4: water.

167
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:23,520
Speaker 4: Damn

168
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,800
Speaker 1: it

169
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,460
Speaker 8: all. What the hell is going on?

170
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,500
Speaker 4: Hello, nerve delivery.

171
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,840
Speaker 4: Would you like to order data on this enemy and countermeasures to use against it?

172
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,140
Speaker 11: This is a combat situation. Get the hell off my bridge!

173
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,720
Speaker 4: This is just my opinion, but I'd say that must be an angel.

174
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,960
Speaker 4: All ships, fire at will!

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,040
Speaker 4: It's pointless.

176
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,220
Speaker 9: An AT field can't be penetrated with this kind of firepower.

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Speaker 4: But what is this angel doing here?

178
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,400
Speaker 4: Is it after Unit 2?

179
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,560
Speaker 4: *Mumbling*

180
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,000
Speaker 7: Mom, I'm schnell!

181
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
Speaker 1: Where are you taking me?

182
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,700
Speaker 7: Just wait here a second.

183
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,720
Speaker 1: I don't believe this.

184
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,680
Speaker 7: Get back!

185
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,620
Speaker 7: Don't laugh, you deviant!

186
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,540
Speaker 7: Why do all boys have to be such a bunch of perverted jerks?

187
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,020
Speaker 7: Perversa idioten!

188
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,420
Speaker 7: Ugh!

189
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,860
Speaker 10: Let's go, Asuka.

190
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Speaker 5: Why won't it sink?

191
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,140
Speaker 5: Only an Ava can beat it.

192
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,640
Speaker 5: What?!

193
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,180
Speaker 5: Something...

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,480
Speaker 6: Well,

195
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,500
Speaker 7: put it on!

196
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,140
Speaker 7: Uh...

197
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 7: Don't stand there!

198
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,540
Speaker 7: Get moving!

199
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,200
Speaker 7: Okay, but what do we need these flight suits for, Asuka?

200
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,960
Speaker 7: Are you dense? We're going to defeat that angel with my unit, too!

201
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,040
Speaker 7: No way! Does Misato know about this?

202
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,580
Speaker 7: I'll get her permission after the fact.

203
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,360
Speaker 7: There, get ready for an amazing display of piloting, third child.

204
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,620
Speaker 7: Just sit down and don't bug me.

205
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,280
Speaker 4: This is odd. The Angel seems to be looking for something.

206
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,740
Speaker 2: I wasn't expecting to see an Angel. This isn't how it's supposed to be.

207
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,020
Speaker 2: That's why Unit 2 is there. And I've generously provided a second pilot as a reserve.

208
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,120
Speaker 2: If worse comes to worst, you can always escape by yourself.

209
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
Speaker 9: Of course I can.

210
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,820
Speaker 7: Erzähl, Einlass.

211
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,520
Speaker 7: Anfang der Bewegung, bestätigt.

212
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,340
Speaker 7: Anfang des Nervenanschlusses, bestätigt.

213
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,260
Speaker 7: Anfang nächste der Herzmonitor, bestätigt.

214
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 7: Syncro start, nun!

215
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,760
Speaker 7: It's a program error!

216
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,980
Speaker 7: It's thought noise! I told you not to disturb me!

217
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,800
Speaker 7: What do you mean?

218
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,300
Speaker 7: You're thinking in Japanese, aren't you?

219
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,280
Speaker 7: If you must think, do it in German!

220
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,900
Speaker 7: Uh, well, I'll try. Uh, Strudel? Brotwurst?

221
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,720
Speaker 6: Don't go off! Never

222
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,080
Speaker 7: mind!

223
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,460
Speaker 7: We'll start over again. Switch language to Japanese.

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,840
Speaker 7: Evangelion, Unit 2, go!

225
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,480
Speaker 11: Communication from the Othello! Ava Unit 2 is activating!

226
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,300
Speaker 11: Say

227
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,640
Speaker 4: what?

228
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,180
Speaker 4: Alright, Asuka!

229
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,220
Speaker 11: Abort! Stop the Ava activation sequence!

230
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,520
Speaker 4: Don't listen to that moron, Asuka! Go for it!

231
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,320
Speaker 4: What are you doing?

232
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,660
Speaker 11: That A-line is put around my jurisdiction!

233
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,360
Speaker 11: You're violating my authority!

234
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,040
Speaker 4: Who gives a damn about your procedures?

235
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,080
Speaker 4: This is an emergency!

236
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,020
Speaker 4: I'll

237
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,640
Speaker 11: have you all--

238
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,280
Speaker 11: Oh, dear lord.

239
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,920
Speaker 8: Unit 2 is still using the B-type equipment.

240
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,420
Speaker 8: What?

241
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,100
Speaker 4: If we fall into the ocean, we're done for.

242
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,580
Speaker 7: Then

243
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,560
Speaker 4: we won't do that.

244
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,180
Speaker 4: Shinji, are you in there too?

245
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,660
Speaker 4: Yes, ma'am. Hi!

246
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,540
Speaker 11: They're just kids!

247
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,620
Speaker 4: This is our chance, right--

248
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,860
Speaker 4: Asuka, take off!

249
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,160
Speaker 7: Go!

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,420
Speaker 7: Let's do it.

251
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,960
Speaker 7: Where is it?

252
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,400
Speaker 7: That way!

253
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,860
Speaker 7: We've got just 58 seconds left.

254
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,260
Speaker 7: I'm well aware of that.

255
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,780
Speaker 7: Misato, get the external power supply socket onto the flight deck.

256
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,680
Speaker 7: I'm on it!

257
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,180
Speaker 11: What's she doing now?

258
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,020
Speaker 7: Right, let's play hopscotch.

259
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,740
Speaker 7: Hopscotch?

260
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,960
Speaker 3: The power supply is in place.

261
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,700
Speaker 4: Reactor connection completed.

262
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,000
Speaker 11: All hands, prepare for impact.

263
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,260
Speaker 11: This is nuts!

264
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,020
Speaker 7: Ava Unit 2 coming in for landing!

265
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,220
Speaker 3: Oh, what a waste!

266
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,880
Speaker 3: The target

267
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Speaker 7: is approaching rapidly!

268
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,100
Speaker 7: Angel! Approaching from 9 o'clock!

269
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,720
Speaker 7: Switching to external power!

270
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,340
Speaker 7: Switch completed!

271
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,220
Speaker 7: We don't have any guns!

272
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,260
Speaker 7: The progressive knife ought to do it!

273
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,860
Speaker 7: *BANG

274
00:14:36,860 --> 00:15:04,280
Speaker 4: *

275
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,280
Speaker 11: Looking good, Oscar!

276
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,540
Speaker 11: This isn't a game! Look what you're doing on my flight deck!

277
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,240
Speaker 6: Look!

278
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,000
Speaker 7: It's sinking!

279
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,440
Speaker 7: Oscar, it's impossible to fight underwater using the B-type equipment!

280
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,680
Speaker 7: Well, you know what they always say:

281
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,300
Speaker 7: You don't know until you try.

282
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,840
Speaker 4: Oh, man.

283
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,740
Speaker 4: How much cable is left?

284
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,340
Speaker 8: 1,200 meters.

285
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,580
Speaker 8: What are you going to do?

286
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,380
Speaker 4: We'll deal with it.

287
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,200
Speaker 4: We've got to do something.

288
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,980
Speaker 4: The cable's about to run out!

289
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,040
Speaker 3: Get brace for the shock!

290
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,060
Speaker 3: Vedant!

291
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,480
Speaker 3: Ava has lost the target! I've got to change the disc!

292
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,340
Speaker 3: A Yak-38 costume!

293
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,160
Speaker 3: Hey, Katsuragi!

294
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,420
Speaker 3: Kaji!

295
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Speaker 9: I've got to make a delivery, so I'll just be taking off.

296
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,820
Speaker 9: Well, let's go.

297
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,020
Speaker 3: Take care of the rest of this, Captain.

298
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,600
Speaker 3: There!

299
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,120
Speaker 7: He ran away.

300
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,500
Speaker 3: Admiral, the target is approaching Ava again.

301
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,020
Speaker 7: Here it comes again.

302
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,940
Speaker 7: Right, I'll finish it off this time.

303
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,680
Speaker 7: Hey, what's wrong?

304
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,660
Speaker 7: It's not working.

305
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,540
Speaker 7: It's B-type equipment.

306
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,500
Speaker 7: What are you gonna do?

307
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,740
Speaker 7: What am

308
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,060
Speaker 6: I?

309
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,020
Speaker 7: You're the famous third child, aren't you?

310
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 7: Do something!

311
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,740
Speaker 7: Look!

312
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,740
Speaker 7: Steve!

313
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,860
Speaker 7: It's an

314
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,400
Speaker 3: angel.

315
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,220
Ava too has entered the target's body!

316
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,819
Speaker 3: Does that mean that Ava's been eaten?

317
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,140
Speaker 3: This is like Marlon fishing.

318
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,300
Speaker 4: Fishing?

319
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,959
Speaker 7: That's it! Fishing!

320
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,620
Speaker 7: Oh man, it just goes from bad to worse!

321
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,079
Speaker 7: Oh shut up you pessimist!

322
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:21,860
Speaker 7: And

323
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,020
Speaker 6: get off my lap, you

324
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,260
Speaker 7: pervert!

325
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,459
Speaker 7: But we've got to free ourselves!

326
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,220
Speaker 4: Asuka, do you read me?

327
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,100
Speaker 4: Don't let that

328
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,980
Speaker 7: angel get away!

329
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,700
Speaker 7: Huh?

330
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,260
Speaker 4: Well, Admiral?

331
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,260
Speaker 4: What

332
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,460
Speaker 5: now?

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,220
Speaker 5: I'm

334
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,320
Speaker 4: going to need your cooperation.

335
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,140
Speaker 5: A point-blank assault by the two surviving battleships?

336
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,000
Speaker 4: Correct.

337
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,300
Speaker 4: We'll sink these two evacuated battleships

338
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,700
Speaker 4: in line with the umbilical cable as a trap.

339
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,660
Speaker 4: When the Ava opens the angel's mouth,

340
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,440
Speaker 4: both ships will rush into the opening.

341
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Speaker 4: Once inside the angel,

342
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,560
Speaker 4: the ship's computers will be activated via remote control.

343
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,060
Speaker 4: They will then fire all of their bow turret cannons and self-destruct,

344
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,220
Speaker 4: destroying the target.

345
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,520
Speaker 4: Preposterous!

346
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,820
Speaker 4: Preposterous, perhaps, but not completely impossible.

347
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,720
Speaker 5: I understand.

348
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,940
Speaker 3: All hands abandon ship! I repeat, all hands abandon ship!

349
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,980
Speaker 5: What about the Evangelion?

350
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,860
Speaker 4: Don't worry about them. They'll be perfectly fine.

351
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,100
Speaker 7: - Hey, don't out-break my aim without my

352
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Speaker 4: permission! Shinji,

353
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,200
Speaker 4: Asuka, do you understand the operation? I'll do

354
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,220
Speaker 4: the best job I can!

355
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,240
Speaker 1: All ships,

356
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,140
Speaker 4: open the Kingston valve. Scuttle

357
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,440
Speaker 4: at point Z. Reverse the

358
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,780
Speaker 4: cable!

359
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,540
- Ava

360
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:43,860
Speaker 3: is started

361
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,180
Speaker 3: to service! T-Money

362
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,140
Speaker 3: 7 need to contact!

363
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,580
Speaker 7: Hey, are you rubbing against me on purpose?

364
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,760
Speaker 7: Cut it out, dork!

365
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,920
Speaker 7: Will you quit complaining?

366
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,340
Speaker 7: We've got to open its mouth or we'll be fish food.

367
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,020
Speaker 7: T

368
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,080
Speaker 3: -minus 60 to contact.

369
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,200
Speaker 1: How's its mouth?

370
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,040
Speaker 1: It's still not

371
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,220
Speaker 3: open.

372
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,180
Speaker 1: Both battleships are sinking towards the target.

373
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,620
Speaker 1: Ava continues to serve us.

374
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Speaker 1: T-minus 50 to contact.

375
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,320
Speaker 7: It's stuck.

376
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,940
Speaker 7: There's no time left.

377
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,080
Speaker 7: - Ah!

378
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,100
Speaker 7: - Ah!

379
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,500
Speaker 7: - Ah!

380
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:16,940
Speaker 7: - Ah!

381
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,200
Speaker 7: -

382
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,720
Speaker 4: - Target has passed beneath the tempest.

383
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,460
Speaker 4: - There's

384
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,100
Speaker 7: no time left.

385
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:23,820
Speaker 7: - Do it!

386
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,580
Speaker 7: - Now don't get any strange ideas.

387
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,560
Speaker 7: - Like what?

388
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,820
Speaker 7: - Let's just concentrate on getting out of here.

389
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,600
Speaker 4: - Works for

390
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:29,940
Speaker 1: me!

391
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,880
Speaker 3: - T minus 20 to contact.

392
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,720
Speaker 6: - Ah!

393
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:38,960
Speaker 3: - Ah!

394
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:39,980
Speaker 3: - Ah!

395
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,900
Speaker 3: - T minus 15 to

396
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,240
Speaker 1: contact.

397
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,560
Speaker 1: Open, open, open, open, open, open!

398
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,380
Fire!

399
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,720
*Evil Scream

400
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,740
Speaker 4: Cut it out.

401
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,000
Speaker 3: At least we collected a lot of valuable data.

402
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,100
Speaker 3: I see.

403
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,000
Speaker 6: Hmm.

404
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,020
Speaker 3: Misato.

405
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,640
Speaker 3: Huh?

406
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,120
Speaker 3: This data really is important.

407
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,340
Speaker 3: Oh.

408
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,160
Speaker 3: Whoa!

409
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,040
Speaker 4: Nice figure!

410
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,780
Speaker 4: They broke their synchronization ratio records.

411
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,420
Speaker 4: Just for seven seconds. It must have been due to the danger.

412
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,300
Speaker 7: Wait! Wait!

413
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,020
Speaker 4: Hey! Where's Kaji?

414
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,880
Speaker 4: Gee, he took a powder. He's probably back at the headquarters by now, that

415
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,120
Speaker 9: jerk!

416
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,740
Speaker 9: My goodness, that was a rather eventful trip, wasn't it?

417
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,220
Speaker 9: Was it caused by this? I wonder.

418
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,340
Speaker 9: Well, it's already restored itself this far. It's frozen, but it's still alive.

419
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,300
Speaker 9: Quite amazing.

420
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,600
Speaker 9: This is the Keystone of Human Instrumentality Project, isn't it?

421
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,340
Speaker 2: Correct. This is the first human being.

422
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,900
Speaker 2: This is Adam.

423
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,060
Speaker 2: She may have looked

424
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,400
Speaker 9: cute, but she was a real female dog, if you know what I mean.

425
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,260
Speaker 3: Well, at least we won't have to see her again.

426
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,100
Speaker 9: Yeah, but Mr. Big Shot here still gotta go work with her every day. I feel sorry for him.

427
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:41,960
Speaker 6: Huh?

428
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:43,880
Speaker 6: Look!

429
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,240
Speaker 7: I'm Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh?

430
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,420
Speaker 10: In other words, darling kiss me

431
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,700
Speaker 10: Fill my heart with song and let me sing forever more

432
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,840
Speaker 10: You are all I long for all I worship and adore

433
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,360
Speaker 10: In other words, please be true.

434
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,140
Speaker 10: In other words,

435
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,120
Speaker 4: I love you.

436
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,660
Speaker 4: I love you.

437
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,040
Speaker 4: When a disastrous battle proves that Asuka and Shinji need to work on their ability to function as a team,

438
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,220
Speaker 4: Misato comes up with a plan to make their dysfunctions functional.

439
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,140
Speaker 4: Drama ensues in the next exciting episode.

440
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,940
Speaker 4: And of course, there'll be lots of

441
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,620
Speaker 6: fan service.

442
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,660
Speaker 6: Don't miss it.
