Speaker 1
The young man I'm just looking at it, I'm smiling, you are smiling I'm so happy to touch the things I want to make I'm not sure how many things you know, I'm still not aware of it But I'll see you soon, that's the back of the back of the future. The moon will be the way to see the future. The cruelest man of the day, the window from the end of the day, the hot-pastus will be the most popular.

Speaker 2
If you're a man who Well, let's review it now. Normally, the EVA runs off electricity provided by an umbilical cable. In emergencies, it can switch to a built-in battery with an active life of one minute at full power, and no more than five minutes in the minimal activity gain mode. This is due to our current limit in battery capacity technology. Do you understand? Yes. Now let's continue from where we left off yesterday. Initiate induction mode. Position the target in the center, then squeeze the trigger switch on. Take it easy. Position the target in the center. Next.

Speaker 3
You know, I can't help but wonder why Shinji agreed to pilot again. It seems that he simply does what he's told to do. I suppose that's just his way of getting through life

Speaker 4
Position target in the Center and pull the switch Position target in the center and pull the switch Position target in the center and pull the switch Position target in the center and hold the switch position target in the center

Speaker 5
Miss Misato, it's morning already. I just got back from night duty a little while ago. I don't have to go to work until this evening, so please let me sleep.

Speaker 6
Okay, I'll

Speaker 5
go. Hey, is this okay Thursday? It's burnable trash day. Take it to the garbage,

Speaker 7
please.

Speaker 5
So how's school? Oh, it's okay. Okay, see ya. I'll

Speaker 6
see you later.

Speaker 5
Yes, hello? Oh, it's you, Ritsuko.

Speaker 2
How's it going? Are you getting along with him?

Speaker 5
Him? Oh, Shinji. Well, it's been two weeks since he started school, and he doesn't seem to have changed. No one ever calls him.

Speaker 2
Calls him where?

Speaker 5
Well, since I figured he'd be needing one, I gave him a cellular phone. I don't think he's ever used it, though, or received any calls. I'm not sure, but I don't think he has any friends.

Speaker 2
Well, I would guess that Shinji isn't exactly the sort of person who makes friends easily.

Speaker 2
Mm-hmm. Do you know the fable The Hedgehog's Dilemma?

Speaker 5
Hedgehog? You mean those animals with the spiny hair?

Speaker 2
Even though a hedgehog may want to become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get, the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans. The reason he seems so withdrawn is because he's afraid of being hurt.

Speaker 5
Well, he's just going to have to learn someday that part of growing up means finding a way to interact with others while distancing pain.

Speaker 8
What's up, class rep?

Speaker 9
Did you deliver the printout I gave you yesterday?

Speaker 8
What? Um, well, um, um, well, um, there wasn't anybody home over at Toji's place. Mr. Ida, aren't you Suzuhara's friend? Aren't you even just a little bit worried about him? You don't suppose he was injured, do you? What? You mean in that robot incident? The television reports all said that nobody was injured. No way. You saw where the explosion on Mount Takanosu was, didn't you? There were fighters scrambled from Aruma and Komatsu, and there were troops from Isawa and Kyushu. I'll bet at least 10 or 20 people were injured. And there had to be a few fatalities, too. Toji!

Speaker 2
Susahara!

Speaker 8
Where is everyone? Has our entire class disappeared or what? They've all either evacuated or they've transferred to other schools. No one wants to stay here after that last battle inside the city. Yeah, you're probably the only one who's actually enjoying the chance to see a real war. That's true. And speaking of which, where have you been, Toji? Why were you absent so long? Did you get involved in the war?

Speaker 10
No, but my little sister did. She was crushed under a pile of debris. She survived, but she's been in the hospital ever since. Both my dad and granddad are working at the lab, and there's no way they can leave their posts. So if I'm not with her, she's all alone.

Speaker 8
That robot's pilot was really dumb. It'd make me so angry. How could he wreck our own city? What did that stupid idiot think he was doing? Speaking of the pilot, have you heard the rumor about the transfer student? What transfer student? Him over there. He transferred in while you were absent, right after the giant robot incident. Don't you think that's a little bit of an odd coincidence?

Speaker 11
He's coming! All rise!

Speaker 12
And so, humankind was about to face its greatest trial. In the last year of the 20th century, the massive meteor from outer space slammed into the continent of Antarctica. The continent's ice cap was melted almost instantaneously. The water level of the oceans increased dramatically. The earth was thrown off its axis, and new devastatingly abnormal weather patterns were spawned. The lives of all living things on the planet were threatened. Several thousand species of flora and fauna, and half of the world's human population were lost in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.

Speaker 7
Huh?

Speaker 12
That was the so-called second impact. The survivors still had to live through the hell of worldwide economic collapse, ethnic conflicts, and civil wars. However, it has been 15 years since then, and in only 15 years we have restored ourselves. This is certainly proof of the human race's resilience, but even more so, it is the fruit of the blood, sweat, and tears your father and mothers have dedicated to this cause. I lived in Nebukawa. Hey, sit down, you guys! We're

Speaker 9
still in class, you know! Sit down now! You're always so

Speaker 7
bossy!

Speaker 1
Now cut

Speaker 9
that out!

Speaker 1
Well, you know...

Speaker 9
Hey, how did you get chosen? Did you have to take

Speaker 6
a test?

Speaker 9
Weren't

Speaker 6
you really scared? What's a cockpit look like? I'm not supposed to talk about classified stuff like that. Hey,

Speaker 5
what's the name of that robot? I don't

Speaker 6
know much, but everyone calls it Ava or

Speaker 5
Unit 1. What's its ultimate attack mode?

Speaker 6
Some kind of vibrating knife. An ultrasonic

Speaker 5
wave. That's amazing. We are so

Speaker 2
proud of you.

Speaker 12
And thus...

Speaker 9
Oh,

Speaker 12
that's all for the day.

Speaker 9
Ikari, where do you live? In the outer part of the city? Everybody stand up! Belle! Hey, you guys, can't you at least show some manners?

Speaker 10
- Sorry, newcomer, but I had to clobber you. I had to pop you one to work off my own anger.

Speaker 8
- He's mean, huh? His little sister was injured the last time you and your robot fought a battle. Well, that's his excuse anyway. - I didn't have a choice. They made me pilot the stupid thing.

Speaker 7
Uh-uh. Ah!

Speaker 13
There's an emergency. I'll report in first. Huh?

Speaker 2
A special state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chuga regions surrounding the Tokai district.

Speaker 1
All residents must

Speaker 5
evacuate to their designated

Speaker 1
shelters immediately.

Speaker 14
The End Our cameras have sighted the target. It's penetrated our territorial waters. Assume battle stations. Level 1.

Speaker 5
Roger! Prepare for anti-aircraft interception.

Speaker 14
Tokyo 3, transforming to battle formation.

Speaker 2
initiate accommodation of the central block. Accommodation of the Central Block in the 1st through 7th Districts has been completed.

Speaker 14
Notification of the government and other related ministries completed.

Speaker 2
Present effective rate of anti-aircraft interception, 48%.

Speaker 15
Status of civilians and non-combatants?

Speaker 14
We've received reports that civilian evacuation has been completed.

Speaker 15
Attention elementary school and

Speaker 5
junior high school students.

Speaker 7
Please form groups with your individual classes.

Speaker 8
Not again! Just text messages again? It's no censorship. The government won't let them show any of the battle to us civilians, even though it's an incredible historic event.

Speaker 16
The fourth angel would show up while Commander Ikari is away. It's a lot sooner than we expected.

Speaker 2
The last time they gave us 15 years. This time around, the break's only been three weeks.

Speaker 16
They never care about our situation, do they? They're the kind we

Speaker 5
women hate the most.

Speaker 14
It's a waste of the taxpayers' money. The committee is demanding that we dispatch an Evangelion again.

Speaker 15
They're more obnoxious than the aliens. I'd have mobilized even if they hadn't asked.

Speaker 6
Entry procedure initiated. LCL oxygenated. Releasing airlock.

- -

-

Speaker 8
- - Hey, I need to talk to you privately for a second. - Who want four? - Come on, please. - Oh, alright. - Hey, class rep! - Now what? - We've both gotta go to the bathroom.

Speaker 9
- You were supposed to do that before you came here.

Speaker 10
So what's this all about?

Speaker 9
I've got to

Speaker 8
see it at least once in my life.

Speaker 10
You mean the battle up there?

Speaker 8
Nobody knows when the enemy will come the next time. Kensuke, are you serious? If we let this opportunity escape us, we may lose it forever. Please help me unlock the gate. But you can get killed

Speaker 10
if you go out there.

Speaker 8
If we stay here in the shelter, who's to say that the risk isn't the same? If I might be killed anyway, I'd rather see it first.

Speaker 10
You idiot.

Speaker 8
What do you think nerves for? And what is Nerve's most important weapon? It's the robot that new kid pilots. He protected us the other day, but you hit him pretty hard. Twice. If he refuses to fight, we're all going to die. Doesn't that make it your obligation to watch him fight? Okay, you're not leaving me any options. You'll do

Speaker 10
just about anything to get what you want, won't you?

Speaker 5
Shinji, are you ready?

Speaker 2
First, neutralize the enemy's AT field, then fire a volley. Do it just like we practiced. Can you handle

Speaker 3
that?

Speaker 7
Launch, Eva! - Cool, all my efforts really paid off.

Speaker 8
I've been waiting for this moment all my

Speaker 7
life. *BANG* *BANG*

*BANG* *BANG*

Speaker 7
- OHH! - THERE

Speaker 6
IT IS! - The AT field has been unfolded. - Do it just like we planned, okay Shinji?

Speaker 1
- Okay!

*BANG* *BANG*

Speaker 9
- Idiot! You hit the enemy with your own smoke!

Speaker 8
*Sigh

Speaker 7
* Help!

Speaker 14
The umbilical cable's been snapped off!

Speaker 8
Ava

Speaker 3
has switched to its internal battery

Speaker 8
power source!

Speaker 7
Four minutes, fifty-three seconds of activation remaining! It's coming this way!

Speaker 5
Shinji! Are you all right? Shinji! Damage report! No problem, Detective! He can make it! - Huh? - Those are Shinji's classmates. - What

Speaker 8
are they doing there? - Why isn't he fighting back? - Maybe he can't move because we're down here. - He can't because of us!

Speaker 3
- Activation time remaining three minutes,

Speaker 8
28 seconds.

Speaker 3
- Shinji,

Speaker 5
let them

Speaker 3
into the cockpit!

Speaker 9
- Once you've got them, make a temporary retreat. We'll start again later.

Speaker 2
- What makes you think that unauthorized civilians can be allowed into the entry plug?

Speaker 9
- I'm authorizing it. - You're exceeding your authority, Captain. - Unit one's remaining activation time, three minutes. Shinji, hold Ava on your current commands and inject the

Speaker 16
entry plug. Hurry up and do it!

Speaker 1
- -

Speaker 8
- What the--? - This water! My camera! My camera!

Speaker 6
Abnormal conditions occurring in the nervous system! Of

Speaker 2
course! You've allowed two foreign bodies into the Matrix! Their noise in the nerve impulse system!

AAAAAAAH! Retreat! Get out of there!

Speaker 9
Utilize recovery route 34. Retreat to the deep side of the mountain!

Speaker 7
Hey,

Speaker 9
Nukid! She

Speaker 6
said retreat! Nukid! I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away!

Speaker 9
The progressive knight's been engaged! Obey my order, Shinji! You've got to retreat! Shinji!

Speaker 7
NOOOOOO!

Speaker 9
That idiot!

Speaker 3
Unit 1, activation time remaining 30 seconds! 28! 27!

Speaker 7
14! 13! 12! 11! 10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3!

2! 1!

Speaker 3
AVA Unit 1 is a good one! Activation ceased.

Speaker 2
The target is completely silent. -

Speaker 10
It's been three days. You

Speaker 8
mean since we were chewed out? No, since he stopped coming to school. Who's he? The new kid. Who else would I mean? I wonder what he's been doing since then. Are you worried about him? No, not exactly worried. Toji, for someone who's so blunt and tactless, you're pretty stubborn. If you had apologized to him back then, you wouldn't have had to agonize over it for three days. Here, this is the new kid's phone number. Take it. If you're so worried, why don't you call him?

Speaker 17
*music* Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars Let me see what's playing, it's like on Jupiter and Mars In other words, hold my hand In other words, darling, kiss me Fill my heart with song, oh, let me sing forevermore You are all I long for, all I worship and adore In other words, please be true. In other words,

Speaker 11
I love you. Overwhelmed and unable to cope with his weaknesses, Shinji attempts to run away. Quickly retrieved by the organization, he finds himself surrounded by unsympathetic ears. And the only overtures of friendship come from his two classmates. It happens in the next episode, where I'll be doling out another helping of fan service.
