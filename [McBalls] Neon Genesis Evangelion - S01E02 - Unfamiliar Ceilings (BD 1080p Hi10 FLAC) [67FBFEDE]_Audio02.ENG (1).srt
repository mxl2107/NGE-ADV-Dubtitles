1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,620
Speaker 1: The young man like a man like a man,

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,740
Speaker 1: you're a young man, you're a man.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,920
Speaker 1: The wind is now on the door,

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,120
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at you

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,460
Speaker 1: 微笑んでるあなた

6
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,200
Speaker 1: そっと触れるもの

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,980
Speaker 1: 求めることに夢中で

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,700
Speaker 1: 運命さえまだ知らない

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,480
Speaker 1: 痛いけな瞳

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,400
Speaker 1: だけどいつか気づくでしょう

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,160
Speaker 1: その背中には

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,379
Speaker 1: 遥か未来目指すための羽があること

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,240
Speaker 1: 残酷な天使のテーゼ 窓辺からやがて飛び立つ

14
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,580
Speaker 1: ほとばしる熱いパトスで 思い出を裏切るなら

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,920
Speaker 1: This moon shining in the sky

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,160
Speaker 1: You're a man, you're a fairy tale

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
Speaker 2: Are you ready, Shinji?

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,340
Speaker 2: Um, yeah?

19
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,320
Speaker 2: Final safety locks! Release!

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,380
Speaker 2: Evangelion Unit 1! Move out!

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,400
Speaker 3: Shinji, just concentrate on walking for now.

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,180
Walk?

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,940
Speaker 1: He's walking

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Speaker 1: Walking

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,860
Speaker 4: Shiji, are you okay?

26
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,980
Speaker 4: Hurry, hurry

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,440
Speaker 4: You've got to get up

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:17,720
Speaker 4: - Whoa!

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,320
Speaker 4: Shinji, calm down!

30
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,980
Speaker 5: That's not your real arm!

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,400
Speaker 5: Where is defense system? The signal's not working!

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,700
Speaker 5: His field's not up! It's not unfolding!

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,880
Speaker 5: It's not up!

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,460
Speaker 5: Left arm damaged!

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,860
Speaker 5: The circuits have snapped!

36
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,740
Speaker 5: Shinji, move!

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,160
Speaker 4: Ah!

38
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:57,840
Speaker 4: Ah!

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,580
Speaker 4: Ah!

40
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,040
Speaker 4: Ah!

41
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,480
Speaker 4: Ah!

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,700
Speaker 6: There's a crack on the front of the brain case!

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,480
Speaker 6: That armor won't take much more!

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,100
Speaker 7: The head is damaged!

45
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,840
Speaker 7: Extended damage, unknown!

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,600
Speaker 7: The control nerves are breaking up!

47
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,780
Speaker 4: We're

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,180
Speaker 1: not getting

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,420
Speaker 7: any readings on the pilot!

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,760
Speaker 7: No, Shinji!

51
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,320
Speaker 4: Ah!

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,880
Thank you.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,260
Speaker 8: Unfamiliar ceiling.

54
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,420
Speaker 9: So, the angels have returned. It's rather sudden.

55
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,700
Speaker 10: It's the same as it was 15 years ago.

56
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,459
Speaker 10: That's the way of disasters, they come without warning.

57
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,520
Speaker 11: On the positive side, our previous investments would appear to be not such a waste after all.

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,220
Speaker 10: You can't be sure about

59
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,800
Speaker 9: that yet. If it doesn't pay off, it's still a waste.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,220
Speaker 12: Correct. Now that news of the Angels has become common knowledge,

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,660
Speaker 12: Nerve must take steps to control the manner in which this information is received by the general public.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,940
Speaker 13: You may rest assured that it's already been taken care of. Don't worry.

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,080
Speaker 14: Government officials have announced that in regard to the declaration of this incident...

64
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,180
Speaker 2: Public scenario B-22. Just like we thought.

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,420
Speaker 3: So we're covering up the truth again?

66
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,900
Speaker 3: Well, at least the PR people are happy. They finally got something to do.

67
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,260
Speaker 3: We're being pretty casual about it.

68
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,280
Speaker 3: I don't think so. Actually, I think we're all pretty scared.

69
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,920
Speaker 3: Of course we are.

70
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,780
Speaker 9: Well, we must acknowledge that.

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,940
Speaker 9: But still, I wonder,

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,420
Speaker 12: Mr. Ikari, were Nerve and Ava used efficiently?

73
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:29,700
Speaker 12: Repair costs for Unit 1 added to the development costs for Unit 0 are simply staggering.

74
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,240
Speaker 11: We also understand that you gave that toy to your own son.

75
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,060
Speaker 11: Time, money, and manpower. How much more will be wasted by you and your family?

76
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,620
Speaker 11: And that is not your only responsibility.

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,980
Speaker 11: The Human Enhancement Project.

78
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,700
Speaker 12: That should be your top priority.

79
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:48,980
Speaker 12: Correct.

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
Speaker 12: Under these desperate circumstances,

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,960
Speaker 12: that project may be the only real hope for the future of mankind.

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,340
Speaker 12: Do you understand?

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,700
Speaker 12: In any event, the Angels are no excuse for the delay in the

84
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,860
Speaker 9: schedule of that project.

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,240
Speaker 9: We may consider adjusting the budget.

86
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,640
Speaker 9: The rest of the meeting does not concern you.

87
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,340
Speaker 12: Your presence here was... appreciated.

88
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,920
Speaker 12: Ikari, you do know that there can be no turning back.

89
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,840
Speaker 13: I know. Mankind has no time left.

90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,620
Speaker 2: - Man, air conditioning's the greatest thing.

91
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,560
Speaker 2: Man's triumph over nature!

92
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,980
Speaker 2: Shinji's finally woken up!

93
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,020
Speaker 2: And...

94
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,040
Speaker 3: how is he?

95
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,740
Speaker 3: Well, his memory seems a bit muddled, but...

96
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,580
Speaker 3: You don't think it could be contamination, do you?

97
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,720
Speaker 3: I don't think we should worry.

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,960
Speaker 3: Really?

99
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,620
Speaker 3: You're right. He did have a pretty hectic day.

100
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,560
Speaker 3: Poor little kid. His cerebellum must have taken a lot of stress.

101
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,600
Speaker 3: Cerebellum? Don't you mean his heart?

102
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:48,160
*Bell rings*

103
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,080
Speaker 2: If Ava and this city both operated their full potential,

104
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,480
Speaker 2: we might make it through this.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Speaker 2: You're such an optimist.

106
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,960
Speaker 2: Hey, sometimes you need a little wishful thinking

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,960
Speaker 2: just to keep on

108
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,200
Speaker 3: living.

109
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,620
Speaker 3: I see your point.

110
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,020
Speaker 3: It's nice to hear a positive attitude.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,700
Speaker 3: I'll see you later.

112
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,720
Speaker 3: Okay,

113
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,740
Speaker 15: see ya.

114
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,420
Speaker 15: Dr. Ugai, internal department one.

115
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,620
Speaker 15: Dr. Ugai, internal department one.

116
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,180
Speaker 15: Please

117
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,320
Speaker 4: call Dr. Azuma

118
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,260
Speaker 15: of the first surgical department immediately.

119
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,440
Speaker 15: The medical conference regarding the B experiment will

120
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,860
Speaker 4: be held

121
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,420
Speaker 15: as scheduled.

122
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,940
Speaker 15: All supervisors, please proceed to conference room 2.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,140
Speaker 3: They don't want to live together?

124
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,620
Speaker 3: Are you sure?

125
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,080
Speaker 10: I think that living apart is natural to them.

126
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Speaker 3: And being together is unnatural?

127
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,760
Speaker 2: He'll be living alone?

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,240
Speaker 9: That's right. His room will be on the sixth block beyond this one. Is that alright?

129
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,620
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,820
Speaker 2: Shinji,

131
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,600
Speaker 8: are you sure about that?

132
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,260
Speaker 8: Living alone is fine with me. I'm alone anyway.

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,800
Speaker 2: What did you say?

134
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,940
Speaker 2: You heard me! I said I'll be taking Shinji home to live in my place, okay?

135
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,980
Speaker 2: It's already been approved.

136
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Speaker 2: And don't worry, I'm not gonna be making any passes at him.

137
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,400
Speaker 2: Of

138
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,020
Speaker 4: course you're

139
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,780
Speaker 3: not! How could you even think of such a thing?

140
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,000
Speaker 3: You've got no shame at

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,080
Speaker 2: all!

142
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,140
Speaker 2: Some people don't have any sense of humor.

143
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,240
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we have to have a party tonight, huh?

144
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,520
Speaker 2: Why is that?

145
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,800
Speaker 2: It's a welcoming party in honor of my new roommate, of course.

146
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,020
Speaker 16: - This city would become a battlefield.

147
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,480
Speaker 2: - Yeah,

148
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,540
Speaker 16: my husband's saying that at least

149
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,720
Speaker 16: the kids and I should move.

150
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,740
Speaker 16: - Don't I know it.

151
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,180
Speaker 16: This city may be a fortress,

152
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
Speaker 16: but that's no guarantee of safety.

153
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,940
Speaker 16: Just thinking about

154
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,260
it.

155
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,480
Speaker 2: I hope you don't mind if we make a little stop on the way.

156
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,060
Speaker 8: A stop where?

157
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,340
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a really cool place.

158
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,360
Speaker 8: It's so desolate.

159
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,980
Speaker 8: The city seems so lonely.

160
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,620
Speaker 8: Here we

161
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,020
Speaker 2: go.

162
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,980
Speaker 14: *Sigh*

163
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,660
Speaker 2: The city is a fortress designed to stand against the angels.

164
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,660
Speaker 2: This is Tokyo 3.

165
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,340
Speaker 2: This is our city, and it's the city that you saved.

166
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,300
The End

167
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,580
The End

168
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,820
Speaker 2: Your things ought to have been delivered already, Shinji.

169
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,000
Speaker 2: I just moved here myself, you know?

170
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,200
Speaker 2: Hey, come in!

171
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,900
Speaker 8: Uh...

172
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,040
Speaker 8: - True.

173
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,640
Speaker 2: - Shinji, this is your home now.

174
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,400
Speaker 8: - I'm, I'm home.

175
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,880
Speaker 2: - Welcome home.

176
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,780
Speaker 2: - Um, as you can see, the place is just a little bit messy,

177
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
Speaker 2: but go ahead and make yourself comfortable.

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,340
Speaker 8: - This is a

179
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,160
Speaker 2: little messy?

180
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,140
Speaker 2: Oh, sorry, could you put the food in the fridge, please?

181
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,740
Speaker 8: Uh, yes, ma'am.

182
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,780
Speaker 8: Ice, snacks, and 50 gallons of beer.

183
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,400
Speaker 8: What kind of life does she lead?

184
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,120
Speaker 8: Huh.

185
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,460
Speaker 5: Uh, excuse me.

186
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,260
Speaker 2: What's

187
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,040
Speaker 5: in the other fridge?

188
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,880
Speaker 5: Oh, don't

189
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,340
Speaker 2: mind that.

190
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,800
Speaker 2: He's probably still sleeping.

191
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,080
Speaker 8: Sleeping?

192
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,200
Speaker 8: Let's eat!

193
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,500
Speaker 8: Yeah, let's eat.

194
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,340
Speaker 2: Woo! Yeah! Good stuff!

195
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,220
Speaker 2: You know, life just doesn't get any better than this.

196
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,960
Speaker 2: Hmm? Not hungry?

197
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,460
Speaker 2: It's good, even if it is all instant.

198
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,980
Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I'm just not

199
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,560
Speaker 8: used to food like this.

200
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,000
Speaker 8: What?

201
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,080
Speaker 2: Are you finicky?

202
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,120
Speaker 2: Um, no, that's not what...

203
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,620
Speaker 2: Isn't this nice?

204
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,360
Speaker 2: Having two for dinner sure beats eating alone, huh?

205
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,860
Speaker 2: Here we go. Let's go for the next one.

206
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,820
Speaker 2: Paper, scissors, stone.

207
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,960
Speaker 2: Three, two, one, go!

208
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,020
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Shinji.

209
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,460
Speaker 2: Okay, that was a really fair way to split up the chores, wasn't it?

210
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,540
Speaker 2: Yeah.

211
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,180
Speaker 2: This is your home, so feel free to take advantage of everything here.

212
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,740
Speaker 2: Except, of course, of me, that is.

213
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,720
Speaker 2: Uh, yes, ma'am.

214
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,080
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. Is that all you can say?

215
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,540
Speaker 2: It's getting on

216
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,100
Speaker 4: my nerves! You're a bully!

217
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,980
Speaker 2: Act like one!

218
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,120
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am!

219
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,880
Speaker 1: I guess that's just the way you are.

220
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,580
Speaker 2: Why don't you go take a bath?

221
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,700
Speaker 2: Yeah, wash away your

222
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,080
Speaker 4: troubles

223
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,420
Speaker 2: bathing cleans the mind and soul

224
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,620
Speaker 2: What

225
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,279
Speaker 2: Huh, oh yeah, he's one of those new warm water penguins

226
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,640
Speaker 2: *cough

227
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640
*

228
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,260
Speaker 8: *Gasp*

229
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,100
Speaker 8: Ah, Misato Katsaragi.

230
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:29,800
Speaker 2: She's

231
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,620
Speaker 8: not a bad person.

232
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,700
Speaker 2: Bathing cleans the mind and soul.

233
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,120
Speaker 8: But bad memories always seem to find me in the bath.

234
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,100
Speaker 8: Like my father.

235
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,580
Speaker 8: And that girl,

236
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,000
Ray.

237
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,260
Speaker 3: So how was Ray today?

238
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,540
Speaker 3: You did see her at the hospital today, didn't you?

239
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,940
Speaker 13: She can work again in 20 days.

240
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,200
Speaker 13: By then we'll be ready to reactivate Unit Zero from cryostasis.

241
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,560
Speaker 3: It's so hard on these children.

242
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,160
Speaker 13: There is no one else who can pilot the Evas.

243
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,500
Speaker 13: As long as they survive, that is what I'll have them do.

244
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,560
Speaker 3: With no regard to what they may want?

245
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,280
Speaker 2: Yeah, after all the horrible stuff he went through, I don't think he'll pilot again.

246
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,120
Speaker 3: Maintaining him is part of your job.

247
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,860
Speaker 3: I'm just scared.

248
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,840
Speaker 3: I don't know

249
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,860
Speaker 2: how to deal with him.

250
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,200
Speaker 3: Grumbling already?

251
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,000
Speaker 3: But it was your idea to take him in, you know.

252
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,940
Speaker 2: Oh, shut up!

253
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,100
Speaker 2: I was just thinking of Shinji as a tool.

254
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,280
Speaker 2: I'm as shameless as Ritsuko.

255
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,980
Speaker 2: We destroyed the angel, but...

256
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,960
Speaker 2: I don't feel happy.

257
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,439
Speaker 8: Another unfamiliar ceiling.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,520
Speaker 8: Of course.

259
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,780
Speaker 8: In this whole city, there's no place that's familiar.

260
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,120
Speaker 2: This is your home now.

261
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,740
Speaker 8: Why am I here?

262
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,260
Speaker 5: *Extended

263
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,060
Speaker 5: Pulses are flowing

264
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,320
Speaker 4: backwards!

265
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,980
Speaker 4: Break the circuit

266
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,420
Speaker 5: now!

267
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,020
Speaker 5: Do it!

268
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Speaker 5: We can't!

269
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,480
Speaker 5: It's not accepting the signal!

270
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,640
Speaker 5: What about

271
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,200
Speaker 7: Shinji?

272
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,500
Speaker 7: His monitors aren't reacting.

273
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,020
Speaker 7: His

274
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,760
Speaker 2: condition's unknown.

275
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,220
Speaker 5: Unit

276
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,040
Speaker 11: 1's gone completely

277
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,440
Speaker 2: silent.

278
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:02,980
Speaker 2: Misato!

279
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,000
Speaker 2: We've got no choice.

280
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,260
Speaker 2: Abort the operation!

281
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,900
Speaker 2: We've got to rescue the pilot!

282
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,380
Speaker 2: Eject the entry plug!

283
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,320
Speaker 2: We can't!

284
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,540
Speaker 2: It's

285
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,600
Speaker 5: completely out of control!

286
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,860
Speaker 5: What did you say?

287
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,700
Speaker 15: The Eva's reactivating.

288
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,040
Speaker 15: I don't believe it! This can't be!

289
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,060
Speaker 15: My god! Berserker.

290
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:49,860
Speaker 12: We've done it.

291
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Speaker 3: It's an AT field!

292
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,100
Speaker 3: No,

293
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,960
Speaker 2: not now! As long as that field is

294
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,260
Speaker 3: up!

295
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,860
Speaker 3: He can't get

296
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,620
Speaker 7: near that angel!

297
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,680
Speaker 7: The left arm's regenerated itself!

298
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,280
Speaker 7: No way!

299
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,500
Speaker 6: Unit 1's expanding its own AT field!

300
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,600
Speaker 6: It's neutralizing the base space!

301
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,620
Speaker 6: No! It's breaking through it!

302
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,080
Speaker 2: It went through the AT field like it wasn't there!

303
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,980
*Sounds of

304
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,880
Speaker 2: Is the Ava?

305
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,060
Speaker 3: That must be...

306
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,220
Speaker 3: Ava's true form.

307
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,640
Speaker 6: Circuits

308
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Speaker 4: reconnected.

309
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,260
Speaker 4: System's

310
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,800
Speaker 6: restored. Graf's back to normal.

311
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,100
Speaker 6: Pilot life science confirmed!

312
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,400
Speaker 2: Preserving the pilot's life is our first priority!

313
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,960
Speaker 2: Send out the recovery team!

314
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:54,880
Speaker 2: Hurry!

315
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,420
*Gunshot*

316
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,420
Speaker 17: *Sigh*

317
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,600
Speaker 17: Hang in there.

318
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,120
Speaker 14: In other words, darling, kiss me.

319
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,860
Speaker 14: Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore.

320
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,900
Speaker 14: You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.

321
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Speaker 14: In other words, please be true

322
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,220
Speaker 14: In other words,

323
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,880
I love you

324
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,600
Speaker 2: Shinji's life is busier than ever, but he keeps to himself friendless until it's revealed that he's an Ava pilot.

325
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,980
Speaker 2: However, this new hero status brings both embarrassment and the rap of one boy in particular.

326
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,320
Speaker 2: Don't miss the next episode, and I'll sneak in a little bonus, okay?
