1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Speaker 1: I just look at you just as you look at me

3
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,900
Speaker 1: You are so happy to see you

4
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,360
Speaker 1: You are so happy to see you

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,700
Speaker 1: I can't even know you

6
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,160
Speaker 1: I'm not sure you are

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,980
Speaker 1: But you'll notice that your back is not

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:28,520
Speaker 1: The world's

9
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,060
The End

10
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:03,880
May I have your attention? As of 12:30 p.m. today, a special state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chuba regions surrounding the Tokai district.

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately. Repeat.

12
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:16,580
As of 12:30 p.m. today, a state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chuba regions surrounding the Tokai district.

13
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,180
Speaker 2: All residents must evacuate to their shelters immediately.

14
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,360
Speaker 3: Damn! Why did I have to lose him at a time like this?

15
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,940
Speaker 3: Why now?

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,720
Speaker 3: We're sorry.

17
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,020
Speaker 3: Due to the state of special emergency,

18
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,000
Speaker 3: no lines are currently available.

19
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,440
Speaker 3: This is a recording.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,340
Speaker 4: Ugh. It's no use.

21
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,820
Speaker 4: This is dumb.

22
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,500
Speaker 4: I shouldn't have come here.

23
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,840
Speaker 4: Ah.

24
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,700
Speaker 4: I guess we won't be meeting here.

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,340
Speaker 4: Maybe I should find a shelter.

26
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,640
Speaker 4: Huh?

27
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,400
Speaker 3: An identified intruder is still coming towards us.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
Speaker 5: We've got it on visual. I'm putting it on the main screen.

29
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,180
Speaker 6: It's

30
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,480
Speaker 5: been 15 years.

31
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,340
Speaker 6: Yes. Well, now we know for sure.

32
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,560
Speaker 6: The angels are back.

33
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,060
Speaker 7: Every single missile hits a target!

34
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,580
*Screaming*

35
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,560
*Gunshot

36
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,220
*gunshot*

37
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,320
Speaker 2: It's not possible! That was a direct hit!

38
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,580
Speaker 2: The tank battalion's been wiped out! Guided missiles and artillery fire seem to have no effect at all!

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,980
Speaker 2: Dammit! We've hit it with everything we've

40
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,140
Speaker 6: got and we're not even touching it!

41
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,680
Speaker 3: Looks like an AT field,

42
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,060
Speaker 6: hmm?

43
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,200
Speaker 6: Yes, conventional weapons are no match for the Angels.

44
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,720
Speaker 6: *phone

45
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:07,960
rings*

46
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,980
Speaker 6: I understand,

47
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,360
Speaker 5: sir. We'll execute backup plan at once.

48
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Speaker 8: Now wait a second.

49
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,120
Speaker 8: No! They're gonna use an end tomb mine!

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,340
Speaker 8: Get down!

51
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,580
*Evil Scream*

52
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,400
Speaker 2: We did it!

53
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,560
Speaker 2: Well, Ikari, it looks like you won't be getting a shot at it.

54
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,780
Speaker 3: Shockwave approaching.

55
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,540
Speaker 3: Are you all right?

56
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:56,920
Speaker 3: Yeah.

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,300
Speaker 3: But my mouth is full of dirt.

58
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,560
Speaker 3: You'll be all right.

59
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,440
Speaker 3: Come on.

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,700
Speaker 3: Ready to push?

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Speaker 3: Go!

62
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,720
Push!

63
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,860
Speaker 7: Yeah!

64
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,260
Speaker 3: Yeah!

65
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,140
Speaker 3: Thanks, Shinji.

66
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,380
Speaker 3: You're pretty useful.

67
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,460
Speaker 3: Thank you, but I should thank you, Miss Katsuragi.

68
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
Speaker 3: Ah, Misato is fine.

69
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,200
Speaker 3: So Shinji Ikari, we meet at last.

70
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,420
Speaker 3: Uh, yeah.

71
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,840
Speaker 2: What's the status of the target?

72
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,980
Speaker 3: We're unable to confirm.

73
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,620
Speaker 9: The E-impulse knocked everything out.

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,020
Speaker 2: It must be dead! It took the full blast!

75
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,380
Speaker 9: External sensors restored.

76
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,080
Speaker 7: Energy rating at the epicenter!

77
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,160
Speaker 2: It can't be!

78
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,920
Speaker 2: External cameras online.

79
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,100
Speaker 2: Oh!

80
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,340
Speaker 2: What the?

81
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,840
Speaker 2: That was our last resort.

82
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,260
Speaker 5: No effect at all.

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
Speaker 5: It's a demon!

84
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,000
Speaker 3: Yes, don't worry. His safety is my top priority.

85
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,600
Speaker 3: Look, can you get a car train ready for us?

86
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,020
Speaker 3: An express, of course.

87
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,540
Speaker 3: Well, I did volunteer to pick him up,

88
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,820
Speaker 3: so it's only my duty to make sure he gets there.

89
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,160
Speaker 3: See ya.

90
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,820
Speaker 3: *Sigh

91
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:18,820
*

92
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,780
Speaker 3: This stinks

93
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,140
Speaker 3: and we needed a working car, right?

94
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,100
Speaker 3: Uh, I am a government official after all,

95
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,420
Speaker 3: so everything's gonna be perfectly fine, okay?

96
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,200
Speaker 3: Okay.

97
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,640
Speaker 10: I don't

98
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
Speaker 3: think anyone will buy that

99
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,300
Speaker 10: excuse.

100
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,160
Speaker 3: You're no fun.

101
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,200
Speaker 3: You know, you're not as cute as I thought you were.

102
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,700
Speaker 3: Hm,

103
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,020
Speaker 10: is that so?

104
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,540
Speaker 3: Ooh, angry? I'm sorry.

105
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,400
Speaker 3: You're just a boy after all.

106
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
Speaker 10: You're not as mature as I thought you'd be either.

107
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,580
Hey, look out!

108
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,300
Speaker 2: As we suspected, it's regenerating itself.

109
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,040
Speaker 6: Without that ability, it couldn't operate without support units.

110
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,340
Speaker 6: Well, quite

111
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,640
Speaker 2: impressive. It can upgrade its operational parameters.

112
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,260
Speaker 6: And it's also getting smarter.

113
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,580
Speaker 6: It should renew its attack any minute now.

114
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,159
The gates are now closing.

115
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,440
Please get clear.

116
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,900
Speaker 3: Nerve?

117
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,640
Speaker 3: Uh-huh.

118
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,780
Speaker 3: It's a secret organization controlled by the U.N.

119
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,960
Speaker 3: And that's where my father works?

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,060
Speaker 3: Well, yeah.

121
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,100
Speaker 3: You do know what he does, don't you?

122
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,120
Speaker 10: All my teachers told me was that it was important to the future of mankind.

123
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,400
Speaker 5: Command of this operation is being entrusted to you.

124
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,460
Speaker 5: Don't betray our trust.

125
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,360
Speaker 5: Yes, sir.

126
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Speaker 5: Mr.

127
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,620
Speaker 2: Ikari, we've already seen that our weapons seem to have no effect on these things.

128
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,720
Speaker 2: That's why we're giving you a chance.

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,820
Speaker 5: Are you sure that you can beat them?

130
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,740
Speaker 5: That is why nerve exists.

131
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,760
Speaker 5: I pray you're right.

132
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,480
Speaker 2: The target is

133
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,340
Speaker 9: still stationary.

134
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
Speaker 9: Estimated current ability to intercept is only 7.5%.

135
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,460
Speaker 6: The wind forces are exhausted.

136
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,140
Speaker 6: What are you going to do?

137
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,740
Speaker 6: Activate Unit 1.

138
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,420
Speaker 6: Activate it?

139
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,180
Speaker 6: But we have no pilot.

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,800
Speaker 6: Not anymore.

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,280
Speaker 6: Another spare is being delivered.

142
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,020
Speaker 10: Misato, are we going to see my father?

143
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,360
Speaker 10: Of

144
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,580
Speaker 3: course.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,680
Speaker 3: Of course we are.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,440
Speaker 10: Father.

147
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,360
Speaker 3: Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,800
Speaker 3: Did your dad send you an ID card?

149
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,880
Speaker 3: Yeah.

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:09,980
Speaker 7: Yeah.

151
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,220
Speaker 10: This is it.

152
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,720
Speaker 3: Oh, thanks.

153
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,300
Speaker 3: Here, start reading

154
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,520
Speaker 10: this,

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,840
Speaker 3: okay?

156
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,940
Speaker 10: Nerve. My father's agency.

157
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,140
Speaker 10: Am I going to be working for him?

158
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,940
Speaker 10: What am I saying?

159
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,280
Speaker 10: He wouldn't have sent me a letter unless he needed me for something.

160
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,660
Speaker 3: Sounds like you don't get along with your dad.

161
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,420
Speaker 3: You sound just like me.

162
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,080
Speaker 10: Huh?

163
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,120
Speaker 10: Huh?

164
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,560
Speaker 10: Oh! Awesome!

165
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,760
Speaker 3: It's a real Geofront!

166
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,240
Speaker 3: That's right! This is our secret underground base, Nerve Central.

167
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,000
Speaker 3: This city is the key to rebuilding our world. A fortress for all mankind.

168
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,560
Speaker 3: What on earth? Isn't this the right way?

169
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,020
Speaker 3: It's because of these things that I hate to wear a skirt around here.

170
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,880
Speaker 3: I wonder where in the heck Ritsuko is.

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,860
Speaker 3: I'm sorry, I'm not used to this place.

172
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,640
Speaker 3: We passed this spot twice already.

173
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,800
Speaker 3: Well, don't worry about it. They make these transit things to be used, you know.

174
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,100
Speaker 3: With the chairperson of E-Project, Technical Division 1, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi,

175
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Speaker 3: please contact Captain Misato Katsuragi of Operations Division

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:39,860
Speaker 9: 1 immediately.

177
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,940
Speaker 9: I don't believe it. Is she lost again?

178
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,540
Speaker 3: Hi there, Ritsuko.

179
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,820
Speaker 9: Hmm.

180
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,800
Speaker 9: Why are you wasting my time, Captain?

181
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,700
Speaker 9: Don't you know we're short on time and manpower?

182
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,440
Speaker 9: Sorry.

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,540
Speaker 3: So, is this the boy?

184
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,780
Speaker 3: Right. According to the Marduk report, he's the third child.

185
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,040
Speaker 9: Pleased

186
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,540
Speaker 3: to meet you.

187
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,040
Speaker 3: Sure.

188
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,940
Speaker 3: I'm afraid he's just like his father.

189
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,500
Speaker 3: The gruff and unfriendly part, that is.

190
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,220
Speaker 6: Handle the rest of this.

191
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,900
Speaker 10: Their first meeting in three years.

192
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Speaker 10: Sir?

193
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,220
Speaker 10: Hmm?

194
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,440
Speaker 10: Looks like the

195
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Speaker 1: target's starting to move

196
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,620
Speaker 2: again.

197
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,120
Speaker 2: I see. Let's go to battle stations, Level 1.

198
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,500
Speaker 1: Battle stations, Level 1. Prepare for ground level intercept.

199
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,540
Speaker 9: There we go. It sounds pretty serious.

200
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,220
Speaker 9: So how's Unit 1 coming?

201
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,980
Speaker 9: It's currently undergoing refrigeration, using the B-type equipment.

202
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,300
Speaker 9: Does it really work? It's never worked before, has it?

203
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:55,740
Speaker 9: The possibility of activation is 0.000000001%.

204
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,880
Speaker 9: Around here we just call it the 09 system.

205
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,600
Speaker 9: Does that mean it doesn't work?

206
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,680
Speaker 9: Don't be insulting. It's 09, as in Oni. A Japanese devil.

207
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,600
Speaker 3: Hmm.

208
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,000
Speaker 3: Well, anyway, I suppose it's a bit late to be saying "Sorry it doesn't work."

209
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,420
Speaker 10: Hey! Why is it so dark in here?

210
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:22,840
Speaker 10: What?

211
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,320
Speaker 10: It's a face! A giant robot!

212
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,640
Speaker 9: You won't find this in there.

213
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,260
Speaker 9: What?

214
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,720
Speaker 9: This is man's ultimate fighting machine.

215
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,800
Speaker 9: The synthetic life form known as Evangelion, Unit 1.

216
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,840
Speaker 9: Built here in secret, it is mankind's last hope.

217
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,800
Speaker 9: Is this my

218
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Speaker 10: father's work?

219
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,380
Speaker 6: Correct.

220
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,940
Speaker 6: It's been a while.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Speaker 10: Father...

222
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,320
Speaker 6: We're moving out.

223
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,040
Speaker 10: Moving

224
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,380
Speaker 9: out?

225
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,140
Speaker 3: But Unit Zero's still in cryostasis!

226
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,140
Speaker 3: Wait a minute! You're gonna

227
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,120
Speaker 9: use Unit One?

228
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
Speaker 9: There's no other way.

229
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,100
Speaker 9: Now wait! Rei can't do it yet, can she?

230
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,500
Speaker 9: We don't have a pilot!

231
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,040
Speaker 9: We just received one.

232
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,960
Speaker 9: You're serious?

233
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
Speaker 9: Shinji Ikari?

234
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,660
Speaker 9: You will pilot it.

235
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,700
Speaker 3: But even Rei Ayanami took seven months to synchronize with her Eva.

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,060
Speaker 3: It's impossible for him to do it. He

237
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,440
Speaker 9: just got here.

238
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,140
Speaker 9: He just has to sit in the seat. We don't expect more than that.

239
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,040
Speaker 9: But...

240
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,760
Speaker 9: Listen, defeating that angel is our ultimate priority.

241
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,580
Speaker 9: If we have someone who has a chance at synchronizing with an Eva, then we've got to risk it.

242
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,680
Speaker 9: You do understand that, don't you, Captain Katsuragi?

243
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,520
Speaker 10: Yes, ma'am.

244
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,980
Speaker 10: Why did you send for me?

245
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,420
Speaker 10: You

246
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,840
Speaker 6: know why I sent for you.

247
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,140
Speaker 6: So,

248
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,660
Speaker 10: you're asking me to take this thing and go out there and fight?

249
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,420
Speaker 6: Correct.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,940
Speaker 10: How could you do this to me? I thought you didn't want me. Why? Why did you have to call me now, Father?

251
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,240
Speaker 6: Because I have a use for you.

252
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,020
Speaker 10: But

253
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,460
Speaker 7: why? Why me?

254
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,160
Speaker 6: Because there is no one else who can.

255
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,140
Speaker 10: No, I can't!

256
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,940
Speaker 10: I've never even seen anything like this before!

257
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,480
Speaker 10: There's no way I can do this!

258
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,920
Speaker 6: You will be instructed.

259
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,740
Speaker 10: But still!

260
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,300
Speaker 11: There's no way!

261
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,460
Speaker 11: I can't pilot that thing!

262
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,180
Speaker 6: If you're going to do it, do it now.

263
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,020
Speaker 6: If not, then leave.

264
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,880
Speaker 6: It's close. It must sense us.

265
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,620
Speaker 9: Shinji, we don't have much time.

266
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,340
Speaker 3: Get inside.

267
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,600
Speaker 3: This is all wrong. I came all this way.

268
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,700
Speaker 10: Why did I come?

269
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,380
Speaker 3: Why, Shinji? Exactly why did you come here?

270
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,960
Speaker 3: You mustn't run away. You must confront your father, and you must confront yourself.

271
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,280
Speaker 10: I know that! But

272
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,240
Speaker 3: I just

273
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,280
Speaker 10: can't!

274
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,820
Speaker 6: Fiyutsuki!

275
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,660
Speaker 6: Sir!

276
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,180
Speaker 6: Wake up, Rei.

277
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Speaker 6: Can we use her?

278
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,320
Speaker 6: She's not dead yet.

279
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,600
Speaker 6: Understood.

280
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,460
Speaker 6: Ray?

281
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,660
Speaker 10: Yes?

282
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,660
Speaker 6: Our spare is unusable. You will do it again.

283
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,720
Speaker 9: Yes, sir.

284
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,240
Speaker 9: Reconfigure Unit 1 system for Ray, then activate.

285
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,640
Speaker 9: Roger. Calling

286
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,400
on current program for beginning activation.

287
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,860
Speaker 10: I knew it! I'm not needed after all.

288
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,579
*Tonk*

289
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,339
Speaker 7: *Oh...*

290
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,319
*Cough*

291
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,640
*Cough*

292
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,160
Speaker 7: Look out!

293
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,100
Speaker 3: The hava activated itself!

294
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,700
Speaker 3: It ripped right out of the right armrestrape!

295
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,720
Speaker 3: No, that's not possible!

296
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,020
Speaker 3: The entry plug wasn't even inserted!

297
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Speaker 3: That just can't happen!

298
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 3: You mean it reacted without any kind of interface?

299
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,580
Speaker 3: Was it Millie to protect something? To protect him?

300
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,980
Speaker 3: It's him!

301
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,320
Speaker 10: I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away!

302
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,000
Speaker 10: I'll do it! I'll pilot it!

303
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,660
Speaker 10: Cooling process completed.

304

Speaker 2: Genetic unit one.

309
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,000
Speaker 10: What is this stuff?

310
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,600
Speaker 9: Don't worry.

311
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,340
Speaker 9: Once your lungs are filled with LCL, your blood will be oxygenated directly.

312
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,060
Speaker 9: It's okay. You'll get used to--

313
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,640
Speaker 3: I'm gonna be sick.

314
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,320
Speaker 3: Stop complaining! You're a boy, you know!

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,660
Speaker 5: Connecting main power! All circuits transmitting.

316
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,420

Speaker 9: All preliminary contacts

321
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,080

Speaker 9: Bi-directional circuits are open.

325
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,540
Speaker 3: Synchronization ratio at 41.3%.

326
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,940
Speaker 3: Amazing!

327
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,080
Speaker 3: Harmonics seem to be normal.

328
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,800
Speaker 3: I see no disturbances.

329
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,680
Speaker 3: Let's do it!

330
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,220
Speaker 3: Begin launch sequence!

331
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
Speaker 3: Beginning launch sequence!

332
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
Removing primary lock bolts.

333
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,900

Speaker 10: Roger. Move AVA Unit 1 to the launch pad.

340
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,000
Speaker 9: Launch path clear. All systems green.

341
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,540
Speaker 9: Evangelion ready for launch.

342
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,660
Speaker 9: Understood. Can we really do this?

343
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,940
Speaker 6: Of course. Unless we defeat the Angels, we have no future.

344
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,420
Speaker 6: -Hikari, are you absolutely certain?

345
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,080
Speaker 7: -Ava Launch!

346
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,620
Speaker 7: *Screams*

347
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,860
Speaker 10: *Sigh*

348
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,640
Speaker 3: Shinji, don't get killed out there.

349
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,480
Speaker 11: In other words, darling, kiss me

350
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,520
Speaker 11: Fill my heart with song

351
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,740
Speaker 11: And let me sing forevermore

352
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,140
Speaker 11: You are all I long for

353
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,760
Speaker 11: All I worship and adore

354
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,240
Speaker 11: In other words, please be true

355
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:01,280
Speaker 11: In other words, I

356
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,760
love you

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,000
Speaker 3: The Ava triumphs, but this angel is only the beginning.

358
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,960
Speaker 3: Worried about Shinji's mental state, Misato brashly decides to move him in with her.

359
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,500
Speaker 3: However, Shinji's mind only becomes more shut off from the rest of the world.

360
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,480
Speaker 3: It all happens in the next episode, and I'll be slipping you a little extra as well.
