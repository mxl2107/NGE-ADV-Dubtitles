Speaker 1
The young man I'm just looking at you, I'm smiling. I'm so happy to hear you, and I'm just curious. I don't know the truth, but I still don't know the pain. But I will know that you will know that your back is the way you will see the future. The evil lord of

Speaker 2
Power supply connected. Beginning system activation. Activation voltage approaching critical level. 0.5, 0.2, rising. Initiate activation system, phase two.

Speaker 3
Pilot link up initiated.

Speaker 2
Startup system,

Speaker 4
phase two.

Speaker 5
Synapsis inserted. Nerve junctions connecting. Cardiograph

Speaker 2
transmitting.

Speaker 3
All circuits are operational.

Speaker 2
No problems with initial contact.

Speaker 3
Power supply to brachial muscles on the right and left arms. All nerve links, check out normal.

Speaker 2
The checklist is satisfactory up to 2550. Clear to 2580. Prepare for third stage connection. Counting down to absolute borderline. 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3. The pulses are flowing backward!

Speaker 6
Something's

Speaker 2
going wrong in the third

Speaker 3
stage! Rejection occurring in the nerve center elements.

Speaker 5
Break off contact. Cut circuit links number one through number six. Negative! The signal's not being received!

Speaker 2
Unit zero's out of control!

Speaker 4
Abort the experiment. Cut off the power supply.

Speaker 2
Yes, sir!

Speaker 7
Unit zero has switched to standby power.

Speaker 3
We've got 35 seconds before it comes to a complete stop.

Speaker 8
It's

Speaker 5
gone berserk!

Speaker 2
Stay back! Auto ejection system has been activated.

Speaker 8
Damn it!

Speaker 5
*Bang

Speaker 5
- chosen in accordance with the Marduk Report, the first child. Designated pilot for the Evangelion Unit Zero. Her past has been eradicated. All of her personal records have been erased.

Speaker 9
So do we have any idea what caused that incident during the last test?

Speaker 5
We still don't know. However, we believe that mental instability on the part of the pilot was a primary factor.

Speaker 9
Mental instability? In Ray?

Speaker 5
Yes. Her mind became much more disturbed than we had anticipated.

Speaker 9
So what did happen?

Speaker 5
I don't know. But she could have... Did something occur to you? No. It can't be that.

Speaker 10
The

Speaker 8
demolition of Block B3 has been

Speaker 10
completed. All technical department personnel must submit their data to the analysis group.

Speaker 11
So this is what the enemy looks like up close.

Speaker 5
Magnificent. Everything except the core has been left intact. This is an almost perfect sample. Thanks, this will be a great help. Okay, so have you found anything new yet? What's that mean? That's our system's code number for "cannot be analyzed." You mean you have no idea what this is? Yeah. What we do know is that the Angel is composed of a type of matter characterized by both particulate and waveform properties.

Speaker 9
But

Speaker 5
you've at least found its power source, right? Something like that. But we haven't been able to figure out how it operates at all. So we finally found something outside our experience. It's a whole new world of mysteries. For example, take a look at this. This is the angel's inherent waveform pattern. Oh!

Speaker 9
What about

Speaker 5
it? It can't be! Yes. Although

Speaker 8
composed of

Speaker 5
a different form of matter, their actual composition in terms of the arrangement and coordinates of the pattern is a 99.89% match to ours.

Speaker 9
99.89%?

Speaker 5
Yes. Once again, we must acknowledge how limited our level of understanding really is. Okay,

Speaker 8
okay, stop.

Speaker 12
This is the core sample. What about the rest of it? There's not much left of it.

Speaker 4
I don't think we can use it as a reference. That's not a problem. Dispose of the rest of it.

Speaker 9
Yes, sir! What's wrong? Well, uh, nothing. Shinji, are you aware that when you say nothing in that tone of voice, you might as well be shouting for us to pay attention to you? Nothing draws attention like evasive actions. Uh,

Speaker 11
well, it's just that my father seems to have burned his hands. Burned them? Huh?

Speaker 5
I was just wondering how it happened. I'm not sure. Do you know? It was before you joined us. Unit Zero went berserk during the activation trials. You've heard about that.

Speaker 11
Yeah?

Speaker 5
It was bad. The pilot was trapped inside the Ava. Ray Ionami. Was she the pilot? Yes, and it was Commander Ikari who rescued her. He opened the superheated hatch with his bare hands.

Speaker 11
Bullshit! My father did that?

Speaker 5
Yes, he really did. That's how he burned his hands.

Speaker 13
Hey! Over here! - Oh, man, whoa! - Oh, man! - Oh, man!

Speaker 2
- Oh, man! - Don't lay down there, man! I'm so sorry! - Oh, my God, those guys are looking at us! - Hey! - Hey!

Speaker 13
- Yeah, they've all got such incredible breasts. - Uh-huh. - Hey, Big Shot. - Uh-huh. - What are you staring at so intently? - Uh-nothing. - Who? - He's ogling right. - I-I am not. Ah, come on! We saw you lurking! Yeah, it raised mammaries. -Ugh! -Race silky thighs.

Speaker 11
-Yeah! -Her calves. -Her... -Noddy bits! Uh, look, it's nothing like that. Then just what were you looking at?

Speaker 13
You can't fool

Speaker 8
us, Shinji.

Speaker 11
Mmm... Oh... I was just wondering why she's always alone.

Speaker 13
Huh? Uh, come to think of it, she hasn't had any friends since she started here in the seventh grade. There's just something about her that makes her hard to talk to. Like she's in her own world. She's probably just got a lousy personality. You two are both Ava pilots, right? You ought to know her better than any of us, Shinji. Know what I mean? Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1
I suppose. But we don't talk.

Speaker 10
Ava Unit 1 is now entering the third stage cooling process. Lower all systems to Phase 3 and Cage 6. The harmonics and synchronization test results were good. All numerical conditions have been satisfied.

Speaker 8
Roger, transmit

Speaker 10
the results to Balthazar. Roger. Transmitting the full range of the entry plug's personal data files to Melchior. Data transmitting.

Speaker 3
This is Melchior. Roger. Circuits

Speaker 12
connected.

Speaker 10
Initiating third stage cooling process. CBL circulation has begun.

Speaker 12
Vent liquid waste to second purification system.

Speaker 10
T-minus 1,050 minutes until the Unit Zero reactivation experiment.

Speaker 7
What is this stuff? It's curry. You mean you're still eating this instant junk? Look, you're a guest, so you've got no right to complain.

Speaker 11
Misato, don't you want any?

Speaker 9
Oh, sorry about that. Ta-da! Slot some of that stuff on top of this stuff.

Speaker 11
You can't be serious. Go

Speaker 9
on! It's yummy to the max. Okay. Ordinary curry-flavored instant ramen can't be this good. Yeah! Come on, let's eat. Dig in, guys. The trick is to put less hot water in the soup so it forms the sludge.

Speaker 7
Masato cooked, right? You can tell? Of course. Who else could make instant soup taste so awful? Next time you invite me over, make sure it's Shinji's turn to cook.

Speaker 5
You know, Shinji, you really ought to consider moving out. You shouldn't let one bad roommate ruin your entire life, you know. But I'm used

Speaker 11
to it now.

Speaker 9
He's right, Ritsuko. Never underestimate the ability of the human animal to adapt to its environment, right? And anyway, if he doesn't move-- Oh. Shinji, can I have another? Right. He's going to have to go through an awful lot of trouble in red tape. He just got his permanent security card, you know.

Speaker 8
Oh,

Speaker 5
I almost forgot again. Shinji, I need a favor. Ah, here it is. What is

Speaker 11
it?

Speaker 5
This is Rei's new security card. I keep forgetting to give this to her. Would you mind delivering this to her before you go into headquarters?

Speaker 11
Uh, sure.

Speaker 9
What's the matter? You're staring at Rei's picture, aren't you? Ah, I'm not! Oh yes you are, Shinji.

Speaker 6
I was not!

Speaker 9
I think I embarrassed him. Now you've got an excuse to go over to Ray's place, don't you? Stop teasing me! But I love teasing you. You go so ballistic. Just like Misato. I

Speaker 11
just find it strange that I know so little about her, even though we're both Eva pilots. She's

Speaker 5
a nice girl, but she's like your father. She's not very adept at...

Speaker 11
She's not very adept at what?

Speaker 5
Living, I guess.

Speaker 11
*Drums* Hello there! I'm sorry for intruding. It's me, Shinji Ikari. I'm coming in, okay? These can't be Ray's.

Speaker 5
Hmm.

Speaker 11
Uh... Um, Ray, I... I didn't mean...

Speaker 9
Will you get off?

Speaker 11
What? Well, I was asked to... I was asked to... You know, so I... What was it? The card. Your card. It's been renewed. So I was asked to deliver it. I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

Speaker 8
Ritsuko

Speaker 11
said she forgot to give it to you. It's true. I rang your bell, but there was no reply. And the door was unlocked, so I... Hmm?

Speaker 10
Central

Speaker 11
Dogma is currently open

Speaker 10
to the public. Group 3 should proceed to direct gate 4.

Speaker 11
Here. This is your new card. Ritsuko told me to deliver this to you? Look, I'm sorry. About what? Aren't you going to have a reactivation test today? Aren't you scared, right? Aren't you afraid of piloting Unit Zero? Why? Well, I heard that you were hurt pretty bad in an earlier experiment, so I thought you might be... Aren't you Commander Ikari's son? Mm-hmm. Don't you have faith in your own father's work? No, of course not! How could I ever trust him again? What's wrong?

Speaker 8
Oh, oh.

Speaker 5
Rey! Are you alright? It was bad. The pilot was trapped inside the Ava. And it was Commander Ikari who rescued her. He opened the superheated hatch with his bare hands.

Speaker 10
*Sounds of the to phase two.

Speaker 3
Connecting pilot to unit zero.

Speaker 10
Opening circuits. Pulse and harmonics are normal. No problems

Speaker 3
detected. We are in sync. All nerve links completed. Central nerve system elements are nominal. Recalculating. No error corrections. The

Speaker 2
checklist is satisfactory up to 2590. Approaching critical mark, 2.5 more. 1.7, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 and rising. Borderline clear. Unit zero

Speaker 9
has been activated.

Speaker 12
Ikari, an unidentified object is rapidly approaching nerve central. It may be the fifth angel. Abort

Speaker 4
the test. Place all operations on first stage alert. You're not going to use Unit Zero, are you? She's not ready to fight yet. Unit One status?

Speaker 5
It can be ready in 380 seconds.

Speaker 4
Make it so.

Speaker 5
Yes, sir.

Speaker 4
Ray? Reactivation has been successfully completed. Return now.

Speaker 2
The target

Speaker 3
is passing over Tonosawa. Unit 1 is beginning launch sequence. Releasing primary lock bolts.

Speaker 11
Lock bolts released.

Speaker 3
Roger. Removing secondary restraint. Roger. The target is now insuring into Lake Ashino airspace. AVA, Unit 1 is ready for launch.

Speaker 9
Launch, AVA!

Speaker 3
We're detecting a high-energy reaction inside the target.

Speaker 1
What'd

Speaker 5
you say? The

Speaker 3
energy torus is accelerating and massing upon itself.

Speaker 5
It can't be! *Mario's

Speaker 5
scream* Look out, duck!

Speaker 6
Huh?

*Screaming* *Screaming*

*Screaming*

Speaker 8
No, Shinji!

Speaker 6
Bring me to the moon and let me play among the stars Let me see why spring is like when Jupiter enlires

Speaker 8
Another rose, hold my hand

Speaker 6
Another love, darling, kiss me Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore You are all I love for, all my voice, a man I don't And all the love leads me to you. In all the wars

Speaker 9
I love you. Shinji survives, but he's injured and begins to deteriorate badly to the point where Rei is to take over in the next battle. As Misato desperately tries to pinpoint the Angel's weak spot, the ultimate in heavy artillery is prepared to face the new menace. Will she succeed

Speaker 5
in time to save Ray?
