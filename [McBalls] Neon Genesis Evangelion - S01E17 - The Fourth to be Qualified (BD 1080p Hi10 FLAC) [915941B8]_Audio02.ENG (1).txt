Speaker 1
As a poor man, This is the end of my mind. I hope you enjoyed the future.

Speaker 2
Major Katsuragi, do you still refuse to allow us to question the only person who was directly involved in this incident, the pilot of Unit 1?

Speaker 3
Yes, sir. It is my belief that he is still very unstable emotionally, and that bringing him here into this situation would be very unwise at the current time.

Speaker 4
Then, as his proxy, let us ask you, Major Katsuragi.

Speaker 5
Did the Angels attempt communication with a human being? After

Speaker 3
reading the subject's reports, I found no concrete evidence to validate that theory. In all likelihood, this irregularity is simply an odd coincidence.

Speaker 6
If the subject's memory is correct.

Speaker 3
There was no evidence that his memory had been tampered with.

Speaker 6
But the Ava's AC recorder was not functioning. There is no way to confirm it. Was the Angel interested in the human mind?

Speaker 3
I am unable to answer that question. Whether the Angels even have a concept of what the human mind is, or whether they can understand our thought patterns is completely unknown.

Speaker 6
A new factor has been revealed in this incident. in that the Angel tried to take Ava into itself. Is there any possibility that this

Speaker 5
aspect may be linked to the predicted 13th Angel and all Angels thereafter?

Speaker 3
Based on the previous patterns we have observed, there would appear to be no systematic organization among the Angels. Correct. They have worked independently thus far. What do you mean, sir?

Speaker 2
You may not ask questions.

Speaker 3
Understood.

Speaker 2
That will be all. Dismissed.

Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

Speaker 2
Well, what do you

Speaker 7
think, Ikari? The Angels appear to be getting more intelligent. There's not much time left. Left

Speaker 2
for us, you mean.

Speaker 8
Who's the patient in room 12?

Speaker 4
That's the emergency room patient from the first Ava incident. She's been here for a long time. Her injuries are really complicated. Poor girl. And she's still in elementary school.

Speaker 9
He's here again today? Yeah. He comes to see her at least twice a week. He's a good brother. Thinking about his sister like that... Yeah, boys like that are pretty rare.

Speaker 7
Ray, are things satisfactory?

Speaker 3
Yes. I will be with Dr. Akagi all day tomorrow. And the day after that, I will be in school.

Speaker 7
And how is school?

Speaker 3
No problem, sir.

Speaker 7
I see. That's good.

Speaker 9
Class attention! Okay, sit down.

Speaker 2
Well, Ayanami is absent as usual. and so's Mr. Ida. Hey,

Speaker 3
what's up with Kinsuke?

Speaker 2
He's in New Yokosuka to see some dumb battleship. Ship called Miyoko or something like that is in port. Mr. Suzuhara! Yes, yes, yes, sir! Will you deliver this document to Miss Ayanami after school?

Speaker 10
Yes, sir!

Speaker 11
The first branch is still okay? No, no, don't bother. The data from the recon set is still being confirmed by the Magi. Right.

Speaker 12
It disappeared. The entire second branch just vanished? Yes, sir.

Speaker 13
It's been confirmed. It's been wiped off the map. Oh my god.

Speaker 12
That second insect had gone crazy. General affairs is total chaos.

Speaker 8
What do you think happened over there? It's under investigation. Our only clues are these recon photos from the geosynchronous satellite. There's

Speaker 14
nothing else

Speaker 8
left. 10 seconds. Nine,

Speaker 15
eight, seven, six, five, four, three, 3, 2, 1, contact. This is horrible. Evangelion Unit 4, its support group, and all the other facilities within an 89 kilometer radius were completely destroyed. Along with thousands of people.

Speaker 13
Looking at the time schedule, it would appear that they were in the middle of installing the experimental S-2 unit from Germany.

Speaker 15
Potential causes range from an insufficient structural integrity to an error in calculation during the preliminary design stage. That's 32,768 possibilities. And that's not mentioning

Speaker 8
sabotage.

Speaker 5
But it wasn't really an explosion, was it? It just disappeared.

Speaker 8
In all probability, they were swallowed by a Dirac-C, just as Unit 1 was. Then the restored S-2 engine is... Gone. Along with our hopes. We're being forced to use things we don't understand. Yes. Things like the Avis. So what'll we do with Unit 3? It's being shipped here as we speak. The U.S. government doesn't want to risk losing their first branch as well. Didn't they insist on the right to build Units 3 and 4 in the first place? And now they're forcing it off on us? They're really pushing it. Well, you can't blame them, can you? After a disaster like that, anyone would get nervous. We'll handle it. And how are you going to handle the test activation? Will you use Ray's dummy plug? I'll decide soon. This is the dummy plug prototype. Ray's personal data has been transferred into it, but our current technology can't really digitize a human mind and soul. In the end, this is nothing but a pale duplication that emulates the real pilot's thinking processes. It's still only a machine.

Speaker 7
It transmits a signal pattern to the AVA. If the AVA believes that there is a pilot and synchronizes, then that's good enough. Load the data into units one and two.

Speaker 8
But we're still working out the bugs, sir.

Speaker 7
Just do it. It's sufficient.

Speaker 8
Yes, sir.

Speaker 7
I've delegated the transport of the unit to the UN. It will be here by the end of the weekend. At that time, you will take care of it.

Speaker 8
Yes, sir. We'll perform the modifications and activation test in Matsushiro.

Speaker 7
Hmm. And the test pilot?

Speaker 8
Use of the dummy plug is not recommended. One of our candidates...

Speaker 7
Will be chosen as the fourth.

Speaker 8
Yes, sir. There is one child available whose core can be prepared immediately.

Speaker 7
Then make it so.

Speaker 8
Yes, sir.

Speaker 7
Ray, we're finished now.

Speaker 8
Right.

Speaker 7
Let's eat.

Speaker 8
Yes,

Speaker 3
sir.

Speaker 9
Stand up. Dismissed.

Speaker 10
Yeah, it's lunchtime at last. My very favorite part of the entire school day. What? Huh?

Speaker 16
Hmm? What do you mean you didn't make our lunches? I didn't have time to cook last night. I had too much homework. Oh, you did, did you? And that's your excuse for me having to go without lunch?

Speaker 10
Uh-oh. The newlyweds are fighting.

Speaker 9
Oh, shut up!

Speaker 8
What's with the grim face? Uh, well, it's the Unit 3 activation test. We'll be using the fourth as the test pilot. The fourth? The fourth child's been found? Yesterday. I haven't received a report from the Marduk Institute. Don't worry, Major. You'll get your report. Dr. Okagi, are you hiding something from me again? No, of course not. Well, okay. So who's the kid? You're kidding! Him? Yes, well, the prospective candidates have to be kept together for their own protection. It can't be helped. I don't know how to tell them. It's hard.

Speaker 3
Asuka will be fine. She's committed to piloting in Ava.

Speaker 8
And Rei

Speaker 3
is exceptional. We've never had any problems with her. Shinji, on

Speaker 8
the other hand, has gone through some pretty bad phases. Even depression. I don't want to expose him to any more stress. I know, but gathering children of this kind is an imperative. It's for the sake of our own survival. You shouldn't... Shouldn't complicate things? Of course.

Speaker 9
Class dismissed!

Speaker 17
Bye! See you later! Hey,

Speaker 9
don't forget that you've got bulletin duty this week, Suzuhara.

Speaker 10
I've got what? The class bulletin,

Speaker 9
remember? You're supposed to deliver this to Miss Ayanami. Aw,

Speaker 10
come on. Who else has duty? It's you and Ayanami this week. It's Ayanami and me? Then I guess I got it. Huh! But I can't go to some girl's place by myself! Well, I can go with you! Hey! Shinji! Welcome home with me, will ya? You know where Iyanami lives, right?

Speaker 18
Uh, uh, mm-hmm.

Speaker 10
Hey, Ray, I'm coming in. Hey, you can't enter a girl's place without her permission. We've got no choice. She won't see it

Speaker 14
if we

Speaker 10
leave it here.

Speaker 17
Uh, is anybody home?

Speaker 10
My God. This is a girl's room? It's so decrepit. Please.

Speaker 11
You shouldn't touch

Speaker 10
anything. You should get pissed.

Speaker 17
I'm just cleaning

Speaker 11
up.

Speaker 10
Well, I won't help you do it. It's just not manly.

Speaker 11
Well, okay. But you know, Misato hates guys like that. I don't care. It's my policy,

Speaker 10
all right? You know, now that I think about it, you've changed. What? You, Shinji. The first time I saw you, I really thought you were the world's biggest jerk. I mean, you sure didn't seem like someone who'd do something for someone else back then. I guess you were so deep in your shell that I couldn't see the real you. Hi. Excuse us.

Speaker 3
What for?

Speaker 10
We brought you your school bulletins.

Speaker 11
I'm sorry. I kind of cleaned up. It was just trash, right? - I...

Speaker 8
Thank you.

Speaker 10
Man, you Ava pilots sure are a bunch of wackos, huh? Thank

Speaker 3
you. Words of gratitude. Words I've never used. Not even with him.

Speaker 12
The city. A paradise made by mankind.

Speaker 7
Driven from paradise, man escaped to this earthly existence on the edge of death. Created by the weakest of beings, created by the sapience born from that weakness, this paradise is our creation.

Speaker 12
To protect ourselves from the fear death instills, To satiate our beings with pleasure, we created a paradise by and of ourselves. This city surely is such a paradise. A city designed and built to

Speaker 7
protect us. A city for those who run in fear from the outside world. The world of our enemies. Of course, cowards do tend to live longer. That's

Speaker 12
one benefit.

Speaker 17
The

Speaker 12
third new Tokyo. Nerve's hidden intercept base. And now, the long-delayed seventh construction phase is about to be finished at last. It's almost complete. Now, about Unit 4's accident, how will you present that to the committee? With the facts. The cause is unknown. But this was a major catastrophe.

Speaker 7
It was of no consequence to us. The S-2 engine sample may have been lost, but the data is still in Germany. This installation and Unit 1 will be sufficient. But the committee is in a total panic! Of course they're panicked. It wasn't scheduled.

Speaker 12
Yes. Zele must be busy rewriting

Speaker 7
their schedules now. Incidents not depicted in the Dead Sea Scrolls may occur. This should teach the old men a lesson. The Intercept system is completed, and they're not going to have any

Speaker 5
party for it? NERVE has got to be the most inflexible and stifling organization on Earth! Well, it's because of Commander Ikari. And are you

Speaker 15
approved too? I don't think that's pertinent data, sir. And I'm going to have to tell Major Katsuragi and Dr. Akagi about this.

Speaker 5
Not if I cover your mouth with

Speaker 15
mine. Kashi! How's it going?

Speaker 5
Uh, well, it's going, I guess.

Speaker 3
Oh, I have work to do. Excuse me? Far be it for me to make judgments on your private life, But under the current situation, is it wise to be hitting on girls who are under certain chains of command?

Speaker 5
Who's under who's not your concern? Would you prefer to be hit on?

Speaker 3
That depends on how you answer this. You know the secrets behind the Marduk Institute and that Adam thing, right? What secrets? Don't play games!

Speaker 5
Asking for help isn't like you, Misato.

Speaker 3
Well, I'm asking, Kaji. Something stinks here. The way the fourth child was found was too convenient. Something funny's going on.

Speaker 5
I'll tell you one thing. The Marduk Institute doesn't exist. Nerve is pulling the strings all by itself.

Speaker 3
Nerve's pulling the strings? Commander Ikari?

Speaker 5
707 is a good starting place.

Speaker 3
Code 707? But isn't that Shinji's school? Misato... Yes? Ritsuko says she's expecting you for a meeting about tomorrow's trip. All right, thank you. I'll see you later.

Speaker 5
Uh-huh. So, can I buy you a drink, cup of tea?

Speaker 11
Kaji, I'm a boy. I thought you'd be a more serious person, Kaji.

Speaker 5
You're saying that to someone as straight arrow and reliable as me, Mr. Ikari? I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I didn't mean to sound rude. Hey, I want to show you something.

Speaker 2
You grow

Speaker 18
melons?

Speaker 5
Yeah, aren't they cute? This is my hobby. But keep it a secret, okay? Making something grow is really great. One can see and learn so many things from the process. It also brings pleasure. But pain too, right? Do you hate pain? I don't like it. Ah, but have you found what gives you pleasure? That's not so bad. If you've known pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others. Being kind isn't a weakness. Hello? Yes? It's Katsuragi. The sync test will be starting soon.

Speaker 8
I was afraid of this. Shinji's sync ratio is dropping. And what's that mean? I can't say for sure, but I think that something may have happened to him during that last incident. Something's affected him. This makes it even harder to tell him about the pilot. Well, the new pilot will be informed officially tomorrow.

Speaker 9
Everyone stand up! Dismissed!

Speaker 11
All right! Lunchtime!

Speaker 9
Report to the principal's

Speaker 3
office.

Speaker 14
What?

Speaker 11
What'd you do now? I don't know.

Speaker 10
Excuse me,

Speaker 14
I'm

Speaker 10
Toji Suzuhara.

Speaker 11
You're Toji

Speaker 1
Suzuhara? How was your trip to New Yokosuka?

Speaker 11
Oh, it was way cool. Speaking of which, I did pick up some disturbing information. EVA Unit 3? Yeah, the one they built in the U.S. It's been completed, hasn't it? I don't know. I know it's classified, but come on. You gotta tell me something. But I really don't know. Haven't you heard the rumor that the activation test will be held at the second test facility in Matsushiro? No, I hadn't. Then the pilot hasn't been chosen yet? How would I know? Misato could choose me for the position. Shinji, would you ask her for me? I really want to be an EVA pilot. I don't know if she could or not. Hmm. Well, what about the story that Unit 4 was lost? Was lost? You really didn't know? It disappeared along with the entire second branch. My dad's whole section was in a panic. Are you sure? I've got my sources.

Speaker 17
Misato didn't tell me anything.

Speaker 11
Well, you know, I guess it doesn't directly concern the pilots. If she didn't tell you, it's probably because you don't need to know. I'm sorry about bothering you with all these weird questions. - Hasn't Toji come back yet?

Speaker 2
- Thus we, mankind, survived the hell called Second Impact and rose again. The number of children have been decreasing on a year-to-year basis. - Uh, sorry I'm late. - I know about it. Be seated. Anyway, it is you, the younger generation, who will lead the way to the future.

Speaker 19
- Let's get out of here! - And Toji? Oh, he's gonna be here late. He's got clean-up duty today.

Speaker 17
The school is now closing. All students

Speaker 9
must go to their homes immediately. Um, Suzahara?

Speaker 10
Huh?

Speaker 9
You're... on clean-up duty. You have to line up these desks and clean off the blackboards.

Speaker 10
I haven't had lunch yet. I'll do it as soon as I've eaten.

Speaker 9
Do you always buy your lunch from the school shop?

Speaker 10
Well, of course. There's no one at home who can cook.

Speaker 9
Suzuhara? I have two sisters. Their names are Kadami and Nozomi, and I always make lunches for them every day.

Speaker 10
That's a lot of work.

Speaker 9
I am actually a pretty good cook, though I guess you might not expect that.

Speaker 10
Hmm?

Speaker 9
And you see, I always end up cooking too much for our lunches.

Speaker 10
That's definitely a waste. If you need help getting rid of the leftovers, I'll help.

Speaker 9
Yes, please.

Speaker 16
Hi, Akaji! Oh, Asuka.

Speaker 5
Sorry, I'm busy right now. Can it wait?

Speaker 16
Do you have time for Misato? No. Gaji!

Speaker 5
Dammit! Not right now.

Speaker 16
Oh, these are our sync data reports. Huh? Four? Oh my god, the hammer! It can't be! Who in the hell made him the fourth child? I won't stand for it!

*Loud noise* I'm not sure what you're doing

Speaker 18
Fill my heart with songs And let me sing forevermore You are all I long for All I worship and adore In other words

Speaker 17
Please be true In other words

I love you Another one, I love you.
