Speaker 1
As a cruel, a man like a man, a man, you become a man. The blue wind is now, but I'm still holding my eyes. I'm just looking at the moment You are smiling I'm so happy to touch I'm just curious I'm still not sure I'm still not sure But I'll see you soon The back of the back of "Signan you, you're a fairy tale"

Speaker 2
Shinji, wake up. How long are you going to avoid school? It's been five days now. Unit one's already completely repaired. You're the pilot. Are you going to leave it sitting there? Shinji! Huh? Huh? He's run away. I'm not surprised. Shenjing!

Speaker 3
- Well,

Speaker 4
um... - Pardon me, ma'am, but we're Shinji's classmates, Ida and Suzuhara. - Ida and Suzuhara?

Speaker 3
- Yeah. - Yes, ma'am.

Speaker 4
I'm Suzuhara. - Oh, aren't you the ones who got in Unit 1's entry

Speaker 5
plug? - Yes, ma'am. We're

Speaker 6
really sorry for causing so much trouble.

Speaker 2
The reason

Speaker 6
we came here today is that Shinji's been absent ever since then, so we came to see if he was okay.

Speaker 2
Well, Shinji's... he's at the nerve training facility right now.

Speaker 4
Oh, I see. These are the printouts that were building up on Shinji's desk.

Speaker 2
Oh, sorry for your trouble.

Speaker 4
Thank you. Well, we'll just

Speaker 6
be leaving now.

Speaker 4
Please say hi to Shinji for us. Yeah, I will. Bye. This is an unexpected development. She was a real babe, wasn't she? Hmm.

Speaker 2
Hmm.

*Sigh* *Splash*

*Splash*

*Splash*

Speaker 7
Thank you for using the Tokyo-3 loop line.

Speaker 7
This train will be going out of service at this station. Please, make sure you take all of your belongings with you as you exit the train. Thank you for using Tokyo Loop Line.

Speaker 8
I ought to go back.

Speaker 7
*Squeak No, there's

Speaker 1
still a tidal wave of

Speaker 9
pushing at 230 meters a second. Doctor, we must evacuate. No, it's my duty to remain here. Doctor, you think death is easy, but you

Speaker 3
have an obligation to watch this

Speaker 2
living hell. Hmm.

Speaker 3
*Gasp

Speaker 2
But he's only 14 years old. Making him bear the burden of the future of mankind seems so cruel. But we have to use 14-year-old children to pilot the Avas. I know. But... So has he called or made contact? Nothing? Mm-mm. Nothing. I don't think he's going to come back this time. What will you do? Nothing. It's better for him if he doesn't come back. But why? Because of what happened after the last battle. Why did you ignore my orders?

Speaker 8
I apologize.

Speaker 2
I'm the one who's in charge of your operations, aren't I?

Speaker 8
Yes.

Speaker 2
You do know you're supposed to obey my orders. Understand?

Speaker 8
Yes. I'm

Speaker 2
warning you not to do it again.

Speaker 8
Yes. Hey,

Speaker 2
are you even listening to anything I'm saying?

Speaker 8
Yes.

Speaker 2
Oh, no, you don't. You're not going to get out of this by just saying yes to everything I say.

Speaker 8
I know, Miss Misato. We won, didn't we? Isn't that enough?

Speaker 2
You know, it may seem easy going

Speaker 8
along with whatever anyone else wants, but if

Speaker 2
you get into an Ava with that attitude, it'll kill you.

Speaker 8
You know, I just don't care anymore.

Speaker 2
It'd be nice if I could say you've got the right attitude, but if you think you're going to get any praise out of me, you're wrong, Shinji.

Speaker 8
That's not the point. Anyway, I'm the only one who can pilot it. I'll just have to do. I see.

Speaker 2
If getting into the Eva means nothing but pain to him, I don't think he should pilot again. Otherwise, he'll be killed.

Speaker 7
But we need pilots.

Speaker 4
Captain! Ida, go on ahead! But I can't go on and leave you behind like this! What will I do? You fool! There. Hmm? The new kid! Ikari! Hmm? Toji was real sorry about everything. His kid's sister really tore him a new one. She said that it was the robot who saved her lives. That must be pretty embarrassing, getting herself chewed out by a second grader, right? Hmm, I like it out here at night, because those noisy cicadas don't chirp. It was pretty quiet when I was a kid, but there are tons of them now. - Misato said that the ecosystem is returning to its former state. - Misato said so, hmm? I really envy you. I mean, you live with such a beautiful woman, and you get to pile up the Evangelion. Oh, man. I wish I could get inside that lovely cockpit just once.

Speaker 8
You really shouldn't, you know.

Speaker 10
Your mother would probably be worried. Huh? Oh, don't worry about my mother. I don't have one of those. Oh.

Speaker 4
I'm no different from you. Huh. You'll take something to eat, won't you?

Speaker 10
Yeah. Do you usually do things like this? Well, sure. Is it some kind of training for guerrilla warfare or something? How could I fight with toys like

Speaker 4
these? It's just for fun.

Speaker 9
- You're Shinji Akari, aren't you?

Speaker 8
- Yes.

Speaker 9
from the Nerve Security Intelligence. Under Security Clause Article 8, we're taking you to Nerve Headquarters, all right? - Yes.

Speaker 4
- And all you did was stand there? - That's easy for you to say, but they were Nerve Intelligence professionals. - So what about it? Geez, don't you have any balls at all?

Speaker 11
- Girl, pervert, ape.

Speaker 4
Only an idiot fights when he knows you can't win. Balls have nothing to do with it.

Speaker 2
- Long time no see.

Speaker 8
- Yeah.

Speaker 2
- Do you feel any better after wandering around for two days?

Speaker 8
- I don't know.

Speaker 2
- The Ava is on standby. Will you pilot it or won't you?

Speaker 8
You're not going to scold me for running away? Of course you're not. I'm no relation to you, am I? If I say that I won't pilot Unit 1, what are you going to do with it?

Speaker 2
I suppose that Rey will do it. You won't pilot it?

Speaker 8
It seems a little bit unrealistic for you to force everything on her. Don't worry. I'll pilot it. But you don't want to do it. Of course not. It's not something that comes to me naturally. But Ayanami and you

Speaker 1
and Miss Riosko... Stow that line of crap!

Speaker 8
This has nothing to do

Speaker 2
with any of us. If you don't like it, get out of here. Just forget all about Ava and us and go back where you came from. We don't need someone with that attitude piloting.

Speaker 7
You do know that the third child is leaving Tokyo 3 tomorrow, don't you?

Speaker 12
We'll reconfigure Unit 1's system for Rei. Regardless of the results of the Unit 0 reactivation experiments, we'll move on to experimenting on Unit 1. According to the Marduk Organization's report, the fourth child hasn't been found yet.

Speaker 5
Does that mean we can't get any more pilot recruits?

Speaker 8
Uh, excuse me. Where is Miss Misato? I'd like to say goodbye.

Speaker 9
You are no longer NERV personnel, therefore we can't give you that information.

Speaker 6
- Hey, Cory!

Speaker 3
- Huh? You

Speaker 6
left this stuff behind me? Oh!

Speaker 8
Uh, excuse

Speaker 4
me.

Speaker 10
Could I-- Um...

Speaker 4
- I'll be back. - Oh, I'm back. Oh, I

Speaker 10
Well, thank you.

Speaker 4
Hey,

Speaker 10
Toji! Come on,

Speaker 6
say something! - Kari, look, I'm sorry about hitting you twice. Please, you gotta hit me back. - I can't do that! - You gotta, otherwise

Speaker 4
I won't be satisfied. - He's a pretty embarrassing guy, isn't he? But if it'll put an end to this dispute, why don't you go ahead and hit him?

Speaker 6
- But I... - Hurry up! You don't have much time, do you?

Speaker 8
- Okay, but only once. - Right, come on!

Speaker 3
Hey, wait!

Speaker 6
Don't

Speaker 4
hold back. - Ooh, that hurt. - How do you know I'd be here? - It was just a hunch. We've seen lots of other classmates off before. It's getting to be a regular thing.

Speaker 6
- Of course, if you're leaving, you know, we'll have to leave this city sometime soon. But we can't really blame you for that. I mean, we saw how you suffered in the Eva. And anyway, if anyone does try to blame you, I'm gonna give him a whop on the head! Come on! Try not to look so gloomy! Take care, Ikari. Yeah, take care. Well, uhâ€¦

Speaker 9
Your time is up.

Speaker 6
Huh?

Speaker 8
- Hey! The one who deserved to be hit, not you! I'm a coward!

Speaker 3
I'm dishonest!

Speaker 1
I'm sneaky! And a wimp!

Speaker 9
Don't give us any more trouble. Jeez!

Speaker 2
Well,

Speaker 7
he's gone. Do you really think this is for the best?

Speaker 2
The hedgehog's dilemma. The closer we become, the more deeply we hurt. Now I understand. I finally understand. He can't let others know how he feels in any other way.

Speaker 11
Express linear train bound for Atsuki is arriving on track two. For your safety, please step back to the area inside the yellow lines.

Speaker 7
The train arriving on track 2 is for special government use only and departs at 420 for Atsuki. No civilians are allowed inside the fence. Please be aware that the boarding of this train by unauthorized persons is strictly prohibited.

Speaker 3
Hmm. Huh? Hmm. Huh? The local train bound for Gora is now arriving

Speaker 11
on track four. For your own safety, please stay inside the yellow lines. If you are accompanying small children, please ensure that they are properly supervised.

Speaker 7
The train arriving on track 4 is the local shuttle to Gora, departing at 432. If this is your train, please step inside and wait until departure. The train is approaching. Please stay behind the yellow line.

Speaker 8
I... I'm home!

Speaker 2
Welcome home.

Speaker 5
Fly me to the moon And let me play Among the stars Let me see what's playing It's like on Jupiter and Mars In other words Hold my hand In other words, darling, kiss me Fill my heart with song Oh, let me sing forevermore You are all I long for, all I worship and adore In other words, please be true In other words,

Speaker 2
I love you Re Ayanami seems cold and distant, yet she seems to have a relationship with Commander Ikari. Shinji doesn't understand how this can be, but before he can find out more, a beam shot by the fifth angel strikes Ava Unit 1 in the chest. Will this episode be

Speaker 3
Shinji's last?
