1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at you, I'm smiling.

3
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,280
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to hear you, and I'm just curious.

4
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,560
Speaker 1: I don't know the truth, but I still don't know the pain.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:01,020
Speaker 1: But I will know that you will know that your back is the way you will see the future.

6
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,340
Speaker 1: The evil lord of

7
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,380
Speaker 2: Power supply connected. Beginning system activation.

8
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,640
Speaker 2: Activation voltage approaching critical level. 0.5, 0.2, rising.

9
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,900
Speaker 2: Initiate activation system, phase two.

10
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,340
Speaker 3: Pilot link up initiated.

11
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,640
Speaker 2: Startup system,

12
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,440
Speaker 4: phase two.

13
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,600
Speaker 5: Synapsis inserted. Nerve junctions connecting.

14
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,400
Speaker 5: Cardiograph

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,080
Speaker 2: transmitting.

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,440
Speaker 3: All circuits are operational.

17
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,100
Speaker 2: No problems with initial contact.

18
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,480
Speaker 3: Power supply to brachial muscles on the right and left arms.

19
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,580
Speaker 3: All nerve links, check out normal.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
Speaker 2: The checklist is satisfactory up to 2550.

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,880
Speaker 2: Clear to 2580.

22
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,120
Speaker 2: Prepare for third stage connection.

23
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,300
Speaker 2: Counting down to absolute borderline.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,840
Speaker 2: 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3.

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,840
Speaker 2: The pulses are flowing backward!

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,180
Speaker 6: Something's

27
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,080
Speaker 2: going wrong in the third

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,480
Speaker 3: stage!

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,380
Speaker 3: Rejection occurring in the nerve center elements.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,780
Speaker 5: Break off contact. Cut circuit links number one through number six.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,740
Speaker 5: Negative! The signal's not being received!

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,380
Speaker 2: Unit zero's out of control!

33
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,160
Speaker 4: Abort the experiment. Cut off the power supply.

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,840
Speaker 2: Yes, sir!

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,080
Speaker 7: Unit zero has switched to standby power.

36
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,800
Speaker 3: We've got 35 seconds before it comes to a complete stop.

37
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,340
Speaker 8: It's

38
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,020
Speaker 5: gone berserk!

39
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,540
Speaker 2: Stay back!

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,780
Speaker 2: Auto ejection system has been activated.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,480
Speaker 8: Damn it!

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Speaker 5: *Bang

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 4: *

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,560
Speaker 5: -

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,320
Speaker 5: chosen in accordance with the Marduk Report, the first child.

46
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,880
Speaker 5: Designated pilot for the Evangelion Unit Zero.

47
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,680
Speaker 5: Her past has been eradicated.

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Speaker 5: All of her personal records have been erased.

49
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,100
Speaker 9: So do we have any idea what caused that incident during the last test?

50
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,460
Speaker 5: We still don't know.

51
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,620
Speaker 5: However, we believe that mental instability on the part of the pilot was a primary factor.

52
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,200
Speaker 9: Mental instability? In Ray?

53
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,440
Speaker 5: Yes. Her mind became much more disturbed than we had anticipated.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
Speaker 9: So what did happen?

55
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,300
Speaker 5: I don't know.

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,599
Speaker 5: But she could have...

57
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,200
Speaker 5: Did something occur to you?

58
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,660
Speaker 5: No. It can't be that.

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,060
Speaker 10: The

60
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,040
Speaker 8: demolition of Block B3 has been

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,500
Speaker 10: completed.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,160
Speaker 10: All technical department personnel must submit their data to the analysis group.

63
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,420
Speaker 11: So this is what the enemy looks like up close.

64
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,620
Speaker 5: Magnificent.

65
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Speaker 5: Everything except the core has been left intact.

66
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,080
Speaker 5: This is an almost perfect sample.

67
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 5: Thanks, this will be a great help.

68
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,320
Speaker 5: Okay, so have you found anything new yet?

69
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,320
Speaker 5: What's that mean?

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,340
Speaker 5: That's our system's code number for "cannot be analyzed."

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,620
Speaker 5: You mean you have no idea what this is?

72
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,960
Speaker 5: Yeah. What we do know is that the Angel is composed of a type of matter characterized by both particulate and waveform properties.

73
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,340
Speaker 9: But

74
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,440
Speaker 5: you've at least found its power source, right?

75
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,100
Speaker 5: Something like that. But we haven't been able to figure out how it operates at all.

76
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,800
Speaker 5: So we finally found something outside our experience.

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,640
Speaker 5: It's a whole new world of mysteries. For example, take a look at this.

78
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,060
Speaker 5: This is the angel's inherent waveform pattern.

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,520
Speaker 5: Oh!

80
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,980
Speaker 9: What about

81
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,240
Speaker 5: it?

82
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker 5: It can't be!

83
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,980
Speaker 5: Yes. Although

84
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,560
Speaker 8: composed of

85
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Speaker 5: a different form of matter,

86
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,860
Speaker 5: their actual composition in terms of the arrangement and coordinates of the pattern

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,740
Speaker 5: is a 99.89% match to ours.

88
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,660
Speaker 9: 99.89%?

89
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,800
Speaker 5: Yes. Once again, we must acknowledge how limited our level of understanding really is.

90
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,300
Speaker 5: Okay,

91
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,320
Speaker 8: okay, stop.

92
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,180
Speaker 12: This is the core sample.

93
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,960
Speaker 12: What about the rest of it?

94
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,080
Speaker 12: There's not much left of it.

95
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,540
Speaker 4: I don't think we can use it as a reference.

96
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,220
Speaker 4: That's not a problem. Dispose of the rest of it.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,940
Speaker 9: Yes, sir!

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,780
Speaker 9: What's wrong?

99
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,640
Speaker 9: Well, uh, nothing.

100
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,240
Speaker 9: Shinji, are you aware that when you say nothing in that tone of voice,

101
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,560
Speaker 9: you might as well be shouting for us to pay attention to you?

102
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,840
Speaker 9: Nothing draws attention like evasive actions.

103
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,320
Speaker 9: Uh,

104
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,600
Speaker 11: well, it's just that my father seems to have burned his hands.

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,020
Speaker 11: Burned them?

106
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,500
Speaker 11: Huh?

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,900
Speaker 5: I was just wondering how it happened.

108
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,180
Speaker 5: I'm not sure.

109
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,600
Speaker 5: Do you know?

110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,860
Speaker 5: It was before you joined us.

111
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,160
Speaker 5: Unit Zero went berserk during the activation trials.

112
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,680
Speaker 5: You've heard about that.

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,620
Speaker 11: Yeah?

114
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Speaker 5: It was bad.

115
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,840
Speaker 5: The pilot was trapped inside the Ava.

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
Speaker 5: Ray Ionami.

117
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,960
Speaker 5: Was she the pilot?

118
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,160
Speaker 5: Yes, and it was Commander Ikari who rescued her.

119
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,800
Speaker 5: He opened the superheated hatch with his bare hands.

120
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,060
Speaker 11: Bullshit! My father did that?

121
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,800
Speaker 5: Yes, he really did. That's how he burned his hands.

122
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,520
Speaker 13: Hey! Over here!

123
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,980
Speaker 13: - Oh, man, whoa!

124
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,260
Speaker 13: - Oh, man!

125
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,140
Speaker 13: - Oh, man!

126
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:18,800
Speaker 2: - Oh, man!

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Speaker 2: - Don't lay down there, man!

128
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,980
Speaker 2: I'm so sorry!

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,140
Speaker 2: - Oh, my God, those guys are looking at us!

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,880
Speaker 2: - Hey!

131
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:24,680
Speaker 2: - Hey!

132
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,860
Speaker 13: - Yeah, they've all got such incredible breasts.

133
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,760
Speaker 13: - Uh-huh.

134
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,419
Speaker 13: - Hey, Big Shot.

135
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:36,620
Speaker 13: - Uh-huh.

136
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,039
Speaker 13: - What are you staring at so intently?

137
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,200
Speaker 13: - Uh-nothing.

138
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:40,940
Speaker 13: - Who?

139
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,659
Speaker 13: - He's ogling right.

140
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,140
Speaker 13: - I-I am not.

141
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,420
Speaker 13: Ah, come on! We saw you lurking!

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,420
Speaker 13: Yeah, it raised mammaries.

143
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
Speaker 13: -Ugh! -Race silky thighs.

144
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,260
Speaker 11: -Yeah! -Her calves.

145
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,260
Speaker 11: -Her... -Noddy bits!

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,760
Speaker 11: Uh, look, it's nothing like that.

147
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,360
Speaker 11: Then just what were you looking at?

148
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,380
Speaker 13: You can't fool

149
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
Speaker 8: us, Shinji.

150
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,460
Speaker 11: Mmm...

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,400
Speaker 11: Oh...

152
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,020
Speaker 11: I was just wondering why she's always alone.

153
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,820
Speaker 13: Huh?

154
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,660
Speaker 13: Uh, come to think of it,

155
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,740
Speaker 13: she hasn't had any friends since she started here in the seventh grade.

156
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,720
Speaker 13: There's just something about her that makes her hard to talk to.

157
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,340
Speaker 13: Like she's in her own world.

158
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,780
Speaker 13: She's probably just got a lousy personality.

159
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,020
Speaker 13: You two are both Ava pilots, right?

160
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,100
Speaker 13: You ought to know her better than any of us, Shinji.

161
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,900
Speaker 13: Know what I mean?

162
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,900
Speaker 13: Yeah, that's right.

163
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 1: I suppose.

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,520
Speaker 1: But we don't talk.

165
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,220
Speaker 10: Ava Unit 1 is now entering the third stage cooling process.

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,580
Speaker 10: Lower all systems to Phase 3 and Cage 6.

167
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,180
Speaker 10: The harmonics and synchronization test results were good. All numerical conditions have been satisfied.

168
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,700
Speaker 8: Roger, transmit

169
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,900
Speaker 10: the results to Balthazar.

170
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:50,360
Speaker 10: Roger.

171
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,520
Speaker 10: Transmitting the full range of the entry plug's personal data files to Melchior.

172
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,000
Speaker 10: Data transmitting.

173
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,900
Speaker 3: This is Melchior. Roger. Circuits

174
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,260
Speaker 12: connected.

175
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,800
Speaker 10: Initiating third stage cooling process. CBL circulation has begun.

176
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,080
Speaker 12: Vent liquid waste to second purification system.

177
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,900
Speaker 10: T-minus 1,050 minutes until the Unit Zero reactivation experiment.

178
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,200
Speaker 7: What is this stuff?

179
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,340
Speaker 7: It's curry.

180
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,500
Speaker 7: You mean you're still eating this instant junk?

181
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,500
Speaker 7: Look, you're a guest, so you've got no right to complain.

182
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
Speaker 11: Misato, don't you want any?

183
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,260
Speaker 9: Oh, sorry about that.

184
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:32,900
Speaker 9: Ta-da!

185
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,580
Speaker 9: Slot some of that stuff on top of this stuff.

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,820
Speaker 11: You can't be serious.

187
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,460
Speaker 11: Go

188
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,420
Speaker 9: on! It's yummy to the max.

189
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,420
Speaker 9: Okay.

190
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,340
Speaker 9: Ordinary curry-flavored instant ramen can't be this good.

191
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,300
Speaker 9: Yeah! Come on, let's eat.

192
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,460
Speaker 9: Dig in, guys.

193
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,360
Speaker 9: The trick is to put less hot water in the soup

194
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 9: so it forms the sludge.

195
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,080
Speaker 7: Masato cooked, right?

196
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,560
Speaker 7: You can tell?

197
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,500
Speaker 7: Of course.

198
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,300
Speaker 7: Who else could make instant soup taste so awful?

199
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,560
Speaker 7: Next time you invite me over, make sure it's Shinji's turn to cook.

200
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,540
Speaker 5: You know, Shinji, you really ought to consider moving out. You shouldn't let one bad roommate

201
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,860
Speaker 5: ruin your entire life, you know.

202
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Speaker 5: But I'm used

203
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,380
Speaker 11: to it now.

204
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,660
Speaker 9: He's right, Ritsuko.

205
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,640
Speaker 9: Never underestimate the ability of the human animal

206
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,440
Speaker 9: to adapt to its environment, right?

207
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,660
Speaker 9: And anyway, if he doesn't move--

208
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,640
Speaker 9: Oh.

209
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,340
Speaker 9: Shinji, can I have another?

210
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,120
Speaker 9: Right.

211
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,580
Speaker 9: He's going to have to go through an awful lot of trouble

212
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,240
Speaker 9: in red tape.

213
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,560
Speaker 9: He just got his permanent security card, you know.

214
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,100
Speaker 8: Oh,

215
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,380
Speaker 5: I almost forgot again.

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 5: Shinji, I need a favor.

217
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,840
Speaker 5: Ah, here it is.

218
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,580
Speaker 5: What is

219
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:06,720
Speaker 11: it?

220
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,100
Speaker 5: This is Rei's new security card. I keep forgetting to give this to her.

221
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,760
Speaker 5: Would you mind delivering this to her before you go into headquarters?

222
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,020
Speaker 11: Uh, sure.

223
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,520
Speaker 9: What's the matter? You're staring at Rei's picture, aren't you?

224
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,600
Speaker 9: Ah, I'm not!

225
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,900
Speaker 9: Oh yes you are, Shinji.

226
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,340
Speaker 6: I was not!

227
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,660
Speaker 9: I think I embarrassed him.

228
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,660
Speaker 9: Now you've got an excuse to go over to Ray's place, don't you?

229
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,760
Speaker 9: Stop teasing me!

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaker 9: But I love teasing you. You go so ballistic.

231
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,520
Speaker 9: Just like Misato.

232
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,700
Speaker 9: I

233
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,580
Speaker 11: just find it strange that I know so little about her, even though we're both Eva pilots.

234
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,220
Speaker 11: She's

235
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,640
Speaker 5: a nice girl, but she's like your father.

236
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,560
Speaker 5: She's not very adept at...

237
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,440
Speaker 11: She's not very adept at what?

238
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,980
Speaker 5: Living, I guess.

239
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,580
*Drums*

240
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,540
Speaker 11: Hello there!

241
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,120
Speaker 11: I'm sorry for intruding.

242
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,580
Speaker 11: It's me, Shinji Ikari.

243
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,240
Speaker 11: I'm coming in, okay?

244
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,560
Speaker 11: These can't be Ray's.

245
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,880
Speaker 5: Hmm.

246
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,600
Speaker 11: Uh...

247
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,780
Speaker 11: Um, Ray, I...

248
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,920
Speaker 11: I didn't mean...

249
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,620
Speaker 9: Will you get off?

250
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:55,620
Speaker 11: What?

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,240
Speaker 11: Well, I was asked to...

252
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,180
Speaker 11: I was asked to...

253
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,900
Speaker 11: You know, so I...

254
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,780
Speaker 11: What was it?

255
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 11: The card.

256
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,160
Speaker 11: Your card.

257
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,040
Speaker 11: It's been renewed.

258
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,740
Speaker 11: So I was asked to deliver it.

259
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,020
Speaker 11: I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

260
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,420
Speaker 8: Ritsuko

261
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,080
Speaker 11: said she forgot to give it to you.

262
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,760
Speaker 11: It's true.

263
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,400
Speaker 11: I rang your bell, but there was no reply.

264
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,160
Speaker 11: And the door was unlocked, so I...

265
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,780
Speaker 11: Hmm?

266
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,760
Speaker 10: Central

267
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,280
Speaker 11: Dogma is currently open

268
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,840
Speaker 10: to the public.

269
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,760
Speaker 10: Group 3 should proceed to direct gate 4.

270
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,300
Speaker 11: Here.

271
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,420
Speaker 11: This is your new card.

272
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,959
Speaker 11: Ritsuko told me to deliver this to you?

273
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,180
Speaker 11: Look, I'm sorry.

274
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,240
Speaker 11: About what?

275
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,920
Speaker 11: Aren't you going to have a reactivation test today?

276
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,780
Speaker 11: Aren't you scared, right?

277
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,020
Speaker 11: Aren't you afraid of piloting Unit Zero?

278
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:44,760
Speaker 11: Why?

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,960
Speaker 11: Well, I heard that you were hurt pretty bad in an earlier experiment, so I thought you might be...

280
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Speaker 11: Aren't you Commander Ikari's son?

281
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,200
Speaker 11: Mm-hmm.

282
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,880
Speaker 11: Don't you have faith in your own father's work?

283
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,000
Speaker 11: No, of course not! How could I ever trust him again?

284
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,360
Speaker 11: What's wrong?

285
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,860
Speaker 8: Oh, oh.

286
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,360
Speaker 5: Rey! Are you alright?

287
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:41,840
Speaker 5: It was bad. The pilot was trapped inside the Ava.

288
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,300
Speaker 5: And it was Commander Ikari who rescued her.

289
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,340
Speaker 5: He opened the superheated hatch with his bare hands.

290
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:10,520
*Sounds of the

291
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,720
Speaker 10: to phase two.

292
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,680
Speaker 3: Connecting pilot to unit zero.

293
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,120
Speaker 10: Opening circuits. Pulse and harmonics are normal.

294
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,040
Speaker 10: No problems

295
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,740
Speaker 3: detected. We are in sync. All nerve links completed. Central nerve system elements

296
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,580
Speaker 3: are nominal. Recalculating. No error corrections. The

297
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,680
Speaker 2: checklist is satisfactory up to 2590.

298
00:19:41,380 --> 00:20:00,720
Speaker 2: Approaching critical mark, 2.5 more. 1.7, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 and rising. Borderline clear. Unit zero

299
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,600
Speaker 9: has been activated.

300
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,960
Speaker 12: Ikari, an unidentified object is rapidly approaching nerve central.

301
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,040
Speaker 12: It may be the fifth angel.

302
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,540
Speaker 12: Abort

303
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,280
Speaker 4: the test. Place all operations on first stage alert.

304
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,400
Speaker 4: You're not going to use Unit Zero, are you?

305
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,440
Speaker 4: She's not ready to fight yet. Unit One status?

306
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,040
Speaker 5: It can be ready in 380 seconds.

307
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,360
Speaker 4: Make it so.

308
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,200
Speaker 5: Yes, sir.

309
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,680
Speaker 4: Ray?

310
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,780
Speaker 4: Reactivation has been successfully completed. Return now.

311
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,140
Speaker 2: The target

312
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,460
Speaker 3: is passing over Tonosawa.

313
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,840
Speaker 3: Unit 1 is beginning launch sequence.

314
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,200
Speaker 3: Releasing primary lock bolts.

315
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,240
Speaker 11: Lock bolts released.

316
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,660
Speaker 3: Roger. Removing secondary restraint.

317
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,960
Speaker 3: Roger. The target is now insuring into Lake Ashino airspace.

318
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,660
Speaker 3: AVA, Unit 1 is ready for launch.

319
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,020
Speaker 9: Launch, AVA!

320
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,540
Speaker 3: We're detecting a high-energy reaction inside the target.

321
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,020
Speaker 1: What'd

322
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,380
Speaker 5: you say?

323
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:30,640
Speaker 5: The

324
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,840
Speaker 3: energy torus is accelerating and massing upon itself.

325
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,740
Speaker 5: It can't be!

326
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,160
Speaker 5: *Mario's

327
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,600
scream*

328
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,760
Speaker 5: Look out, duck!

329
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,340
Speaker 6: Huh?

330
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,220
*Screaming*

331
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,800
*Screaming*

332
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,680
*Screaming*

333
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
Speaker 8: No, Shinji!

334
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,160
Bring me to the moon and let me play among the stars

335
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:16,720
Speaker 6: Let me see why spring is like when Jupiter enlires

336
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,260
Another rose, hold

337
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,380
Speaker 8: my hand

338
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Another love, darling, kiss me

339
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,520
Speaker 6: Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore

340
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,960
Speaker 6: You are all I love for, all my voice, a man I don't

341
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Speaker 6: And all the love leads me to you.

342
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,920
Speaker 6: In all the wars

343
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,420
I love you.

344
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,260
Speaker 9: Shinji survives, but he's injured and begins to deteriorate badly

345
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,560
Speaker 9: to the point where Rei is to take over in the next battle.

346
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,660
Speaker 9: As Misato desperately tries to pinpoint the Angel's weak spot,

347
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,060
Speaker 9: the ultimate in heavy artillery is prepared to face the new menace.

348
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,860
Speaker 9: Will she succeed

349
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,840
Speaker 5: in time to save Ray?
