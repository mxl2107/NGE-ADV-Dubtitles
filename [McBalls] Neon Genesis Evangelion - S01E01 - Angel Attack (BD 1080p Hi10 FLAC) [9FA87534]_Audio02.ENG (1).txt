Speaker 1
The young man I just look at you just as you look at me You are so happy to see you You are so happy to see you I can't even know you I'm not sure you are But you'll notice that your back is not The world's

The End May I have your attention? As of 12:30 p.m. today, a special state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chuba regions surrounding the Tokai district.

All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately. Repeat.

As of 12:30 p.m. today, a state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chuba regions surrounding the Tokai district.

Speaker 2
All residents must evacuate to their shelters immediately.

Speaker 3
Damn! Why did I have to lose him at a time like this? Why now? We're sorry. Due to the state of special emergency, no lines are currently available. This is a recording.

Speaker 4
Ugh. It's no use. This is dumb. I shouldn't have come here. Ah. I guess we won't be meeting here. Maybe I should find a shelter. Huh?

Speaker 3
An identified intruder is still coming towards us.

Speaker 5
We've got it on visual. I'm putting it on the main screen.

Speaker 6
It's

Speaker 5
been 15 years.

Speaker 6
Yes. Well, now we know for sure. The angels are back.

Speaker 7
Every single missile hits a target!

*Screaming* *Gunshot

*gunshot*

Speaker 2
It's not possible! That was a direct hit! The tank battalion's been wiped out! Guided missiles and artillery fire seem to have no effect at all! Dammit! We've hit it with everything we've

Speaker 6
got and we're not even touching it!

Speaker 3
Looks like an AT field,

Speaker 6
hmm? Yes, conventional weapons are no match for the Angels. *phone

Speaker 6
rings* I understand,

Speaker 5
sir. We'll execute backup plan at once.

Speaker 8
Now wait a second. No! They're gonna use an end tomb mine! Get down!

Speaker 2
*Evil Scream* We did it! Well, Ikari, it looks like you won't be getting a shot at it.

Speaker 3
Shockwave approaching. Are you all right? Yeah. But my mouth is full of dirt. You'll be all right. Come on. Ready to push? Go!

Speaker 7
Push! Yeah!

Speaker 3
Yeah! Thanks, Shinji. You're pretty useful. Thank you, but I should thank you, Miss Katsuragi. Ah, Misato is fine. So Shinji Ikari, we meet at last. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 2
What's the status of the target?

Speaker 3
We're unable to confirm.

Speaker 9
The E-impulse knocked everything out.

Speaker 2
It must be dead! It took the full blast!

Speaker 9
External sensors restored.

Speaker 7
Energy rating at the epicenter!

Speaker 2
It can't be! External cameras online. Oh! What the? That was our last resort.

Speaker 5
No effect at all. It's a demon!

Speaker 3
Yes, don't worry. His safety is my top priority. Look, can you get a car train ready for us? An express, of course. Well, I did volunteer to pick him up, so it's only my duty to make sure he gets there. See ya. *Sigh

Speaker 3
* This stinks and we needed a working car, right? Uh, I am a government official after all, so everything's gonna be perfectly fine, okay? Okay.

Speaker 10
I don't

Speaker 3
think anyone will buy that

Speaker 10
excuse.

Speaker 3
You're no fun. You know, you're not as cute as I thought you were. Hm,

Speaker 10
is that so?

Speaker 3
Ooh, angry? I'm sorry. You're just a boy after all.

Speaker 10
You're not as mature as I thought you'd be either.

Speaker 2
Hey, look out! As we suspected, it's regenerating itself.

Speaker 6
Without that ability, it couldn't operate without support units. Well, quite

Speaker 2
impressive. It can upgrade its operational parameters.

Speaker 6
And it's also getting smarter. It should renew its attack any minute now.

The gates are now closing. Please get clear.

Speaker 3
Nerve? Uh-huh. It's a secret organization controlled by the U.N. And that's where my father works? Well, yeah. You do know what he does, don't you?

Speaker 10
All my teachers told me was that it was important to the future of mankind.

Speaker 5
Command of this operation is being entrusted to you. Don't betray our trust. Yes, sir. Mr.

Speaker 2
Ikari, we've already seen that our weapons seem to have no effect on these things. That's why we're giving you a chance.

Speaker 5
Are you sure that you can beat them? That is why nerve exists. I pray you're right.

Speaker 2
The target is

Speaker 9
still stationary. Estimated current ability to intercept is only 7.5%.

Speaker 6
The wind forces are exhausted. What are you going to do? Activate Unit 1. Activate it? But we have no pilot. Not anymore. Another spare is being delivered.

Speaker 10
Misato, are we going to see my father? Of

Speaker 3
course. Of course we are.

Speaker 10
Father.

Speaker 3
Oh, yeah. Did your dad send you an ID card? Yeah.

Speaker 7
Yeah.

Speaker 10
This is it.

Speaker 3
Oh, thanks. Here, start reading

Speaker 10
this,

Speaker 3
okay?

Speaker 10
Nerve. My father's agency. Am I going to be working for him? What am I saying? He wouldn't have sent me a letter unless he needed me for something.

Speaker 3
Sounds like you don't get along with your dad. You sound just like me.

Speaker 10
Huh? Huh? Oh! Awesome!

Speaker 3
It's a real Geofront! That's right! This is our secret underground base, Nerve Central. This city is the key to rebuilding our world. A fortress for all mankind. What on earth? Isn't this the right way? It's because of these things that I hate to wear a skirt around here. I wonder where in the heck Ritsuko is. I'm sorry, I'm not used to this place. We passed this spot twice already. Well, don't worry about it. They make these transit things to be used, you know. With the chairperson of E-Project, Technical Division 1, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, please contact Captain Misato Katsuragi of Operations Division

Speaker 9
1 immediately. I don't believe it. Is she lost again?

Speaker 3
Hi there, Ritsuko.

Speaker 9
Hmm. Why are you wasting my time, Captain? Don't you know we're short on time and manpower? Sorry.

Speaker 3
So, is this the boy? Right. According to the Marduk report, he's the third child.

Speaker 9
Pleased

Speaker 3
to meet you. Sure. I'm afraid he's just like his father. The gruff and unfriendly part, that is.

Speaker 6
Handle the rest of this.

Speaker 10
Their first meeting in three years. Sir? Hmm? Looks like the

Speaker 1
target's starting to move

Speaker 2
again. I see. Let's go to battle stations, Level 1.

Speaker 1
Battle stations, Level 1. Prepare for ground level intercept.

Speaker 9
There we go. It sounds pretty serious. So how's Unit 1 coming? It's currently undergoing refrigeration, using the B-type equipment. Does it really work? It's never worked before, has it? The possibility of activation is 0.000000001%. Around here we just call it the 09 system. Does that mean it doesn't work? Don't be insulting. It's 09, as in Oni. A Japanese devil.

Speaker 3
Hmm. Well, anyway, I suppose it's a bit late to be saying "Sorry it doesn't work."

Speaker 10
Hey! Why is it so dark in here? What? It's a face! A giant robot!

Speaker 9
You won't find this in there. What? This is man's ultimate fighting machine. The synthetic life form known as Evangelion, Unit 1. Built here in secret, it is mankind's last hope. Is this my

Speaker 10
father's work?

Speaker 6
Correct. It's been a while.

Speaker 10
Father...

Speaker 6
We're moving out.

Speaker 10
Moving

Speaker 9
out?

Speaker 3
But Unit Zero's still in cryostasis! Wait a minute! You're gonna

Speaker 9
use Unit One? There's no other way. Now wait! Rei can't do it yet, can she? We don't have a pilot! We just received one. You're serious? Shinji Ikari? You will pilot it.

Speaker 3
But even Rei Ayanami took seven months to synchronize with her Eva. It's impossible for him to do it. He

Speaker 9
just got here. He just has to sit in the seat. We don't expect more than that. But... Listen, defeating that angel is our ultimate priority. If we have someone who has a chance at synchronizing with an Eva, then we've got to risk it. You do understand that, don't you, Captain Katsuragi?

Speaker 10
Yes, ma'am. Why did you send for me? You

Speaker 6
know why I sent for you. So,

Speaker 10
you're asking me to take this thing and go out there and fight?

Speaker 6
Correct.

Speaker 10
How could you do this to me? I thought you didn't want me. Why? Why did you have to call me now, Father?

Speaker 6
Because I have a use for you.

Speaker 10
But

Speaker 7
why? Why me?

Speaker 6
Because there is no one else who can.

Speaker 10
No, I can't! I've never even seen anything like this before! There's no way I can do this!

Speaker 6
You will be instructed.

Speaker 10
But still!

Speaker 11
There's no way! I can't pilot that thing!

Speaker 6
If you're going to do it, do it now. If not, then leave. It's close. It must sense us.

Speaker 9
Shinji, we don't have much time.

Speaker 3
Get inside. This is all wrong. I came all this way.

Speaker 10
Why did I come?

Speaker 3
Why, Shinji? Exactly why did you come here? You mustn't run away. You must confront your father, and you must confront yourself.

Speaker 10
I know that! But

Speaker 3
I just

Speaker 10
can't!

Speaker 6
Fiyutsuki! Sir! Wake up, Rei. Can we use her? She's not dead yet. Understood. Ray?

Speaker 10
Yes?

Speaker 6
Our spare is unusable. You will do it again.

Speaker 9
Yes, sir. Reconfigure Unit 1 system for Ray, then activate. Roger. Calling

Speaker 10
on current program for beginning activation. I knew it! I'm not needed after all.

Speaker 7
*Tonk* *Oh...*

*Cough* *Cough*

Speaker 7
Look out!

Speaker 3
The hava activated itself! It ripped right out of the right armrestrape! No, that's not possible! The entry plug wasn't even inserted! That just can't happen! You mean it reacted without any kind of interface? Was it Millie to protect something? To protect him? It's him!

Speaker 10
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away! I'll do it! I'll pilot it! Cooling process completed.

Speaker 2
Right arm repairs completed. Cage now in position for docking.

Speaker 3
Signal plug Terminator now being ejected.

Speaker 2
Roger. Inserting entry plug. Clubs locked in place. Genetic unit one.

Speaker 10
What is this stuff?

Speaker 9
Don't worry. Once your lungs are filled with LCL, your blood will be oxygenated directly. It's okay. You'll get used to--

Speaker 3
I'm gonna be sick. Stop complaining! You're a boy, you know!

Speaker 5
Connecting main power! All circuits transmitting.

Speaker 10
Roger! Connecting secondary contacts. A-10 nerve connection

Speaker 9
normal. Configure the language logic interface for Japanese. All preliminary contacts

Speaker 7
established.

Speaker 3
Performance

Speaker 7
nominal.

Speaker 9
Bi-directional circuits are open.

Speaker 3
Synchronization ratio at 41.3%. Amazing! Harmonics seem to be normal. I see no disturbances. Let's do it! Begin launch sequence! Beginning launch sequence!

Removing primary lock bolts. Removal confirmed.

Removing the umbilical bridge.

Removing secondary lock bolts. Removing primary restraints. Removing secondary restraints.

Speaker 6
Releasing safety locks number 1 through 15. Internal batteries

Speaker 2
fully charged. External battery outlet closed.

Speaker 10
Roger. Move AVA Unit 1 to the launch pad.

Speaker 9
Launch path clear. All systems green. Evangelion ready for launch. Understood. Can we really do this?

Speaker 6
Of course. Unless we defeat the Angels, we have no future. -Hikari, are you absolutely certain?

Speaker 7
-Ava Launch! *Screams*

Speaker 10
*Sigh*

Speaker 3
Shinji, don't get killed out there.

Speaker 11
In other words, darling, kiss me Fill my heart with song And let me sing forevermore You are all I long for All I worship and adore In other words, please be true In other words, I

Speaker 3
love you The Ava triumphs, but this angel is only the beginning. Worried about Shinji's mental state, Misato brashly decides to move him in with her. However, Shinji's mind only becomes more shut off from the rest of the world. It all happens in the next episode, and I'll be slipping you a little extra as well.
