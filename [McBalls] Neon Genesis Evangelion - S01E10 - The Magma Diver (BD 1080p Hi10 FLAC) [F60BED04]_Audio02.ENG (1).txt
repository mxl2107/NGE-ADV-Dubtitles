Speaker 1
The young man I just saw you I'm smiling I'm so happy to see you I'm still not sure I'm not sure But I'll see you soon I'm so excited to see you next time.

Speaker 2
Fuck me! I'm so glad I'm going shopping with you, Kaji!

Speaker 3
Hey, wait a second. Isn't this the swimsuit section?

Speaker 2
That's right! What do you think of this one?

Speaker 3
Um, aren't you just a little young to be wearing something like that, Asuka?

Speaker 2
Oh, come on, Kaji. This is what all the girls are wearing.

Speaker 3
Oh, really?

Speaker 2
Uh-huh. Oh, I'm so anxious about this school trip. I just know we'll have a great time.

Speaker 3
So, where is your class going?

Speaker 2
Okinawa! It's gonna be awesome! We're even gonna go scuba diving!

Speaker 3
Scuba diving, huh? Boy, it's been years since the last time I went diving.

Speaker 2
Hey, where'd you go for your school trip, Kaji?

Speaker 3
Well, actually, we didn't have one.

Speaker 2
Why is that?

Speaker 3
Just a little thing called the second impact.

Speaker 2
What? Did you just think I can't go on the trip?

Speaker 4
Yep. Well, why not? It's part of your job. You mean I'm on permanent standby? You got it. What idiot decided that? This one. The operations planning manager.

Speaker 2
Shinji, why don't you stop hiding behind that cup of tea and talk some sense into this woman. Act like a man.

Speaker 5
Well, you know, actually, I had kind of expected that we wouldn't be allowed to go. So you've already given

Speaker 4
up.

Speaker 1
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 4
Huh, pathetic. There's nothing more useless than a housebroken male.

Speaker 1
Hey, don't talk about me like that.

Speaker 4
Look, I know how you must feel, but there's just no other way. There's always the possibility that an angel might attack while you're away. So I

Speaker 2
get stuck here on standby status while everyone else is having fun? Why is it that we're the ones who always have to be ready to defend against them. Any good officer knows that the best defense is a good offense. Why can't we find them and attack them first? - If we could

Speaker 4
do that, we would do it. Look, think of this as an opportunity to get ahead for a change. The two of you can catch up on your studies while the rest of your classmates are on the trip. Or did you think I hadn't seen these report cards? I guess you thought I wouldn't know about your test scores yet. Well, all of your grades are forwarded directly to my terminal and I have been very disappointed with the both of you. - Ah, this is so silly and this school's grades are just dumb. The old fashioned numeric grading scale you use on your exams is stupid. - In Rome, do as the Romans do. You could at least try to adjust to Japanese school life.

Speaker 6
- This sucks! - Hey Asuka, I'll bring you back something

Speaker 2
nice. - Sayonara suckers. - Hey, don't worry. enough fun for the both of you!

Speaker 7
Post the survey data on Mount Asimel from Balthazar to Melchior as soon as possible.

Speaker 8
A school trip, huh? That sounds pretty reckless in times like these.

Speaker 4
I guess the idea is to let all the kids have time to get out and act like kids while they can. *BOOM

Speaker 2
* Hmm, what have you got there, Shinji?

Speaker 5
Basic physics primer. Oh,

Speaker 2
you're such an obedient student.

Speaker 1
Well, I'll have to study it anyway. I mean, I...

Speaker 2
Well, if I can't go diving in Okinawa, let's do it here. Do what? Diving, of course. So what are you working on? Let's see. You can't solve an easy problem like this? There, all done. It's easy when you know how.

Speaker 6
How can you solve a difficult problem like this and not make good grades on your tests?

Speaker 2
It's because I'm having too much trouble figuring out what the questions are. You mean you can't read the questions in Japanese? That's right. I still haven't learned all of the kanji yet. I didn't have to study it in college. You went to college? Yeah, I graduated last year. So, what does this one say? It's a question about

Speaker 7
thermal expansion.

Speaker 2
Thermal expansion? Oh man, that's kid stuff. To put it in terms you'll understand, most things expand when they get hot and contract when they get cold. Well, it sounds

Speaker 1
simple enough. Look,

Speaker 2
if I were to warm up my breasts with my hands, do you think they'd grow bigger or smaller? I don't know. I don't think about things like that. Such a boring little boy. Oh. Hurry!

Speaker 9
This just isn't clear enough. But the report from the Mount Asuma Earthquake Research Lab implies we should take a closer look at this shadow. We can't ignore it. What

Speaker 8
do the Magi say?

Speaker 5
It's 50/50 odds.

Speaker 9
Who's up there? Katsuragi has already arrived at the site. Ma'am, you're going too deep?

Speaker 4
Thin the probe down another 500. Depth, 1200. The pressure-resistant partition is cracking. That's Katsuragi. If it breaks, we'll pay for the damage. 200 more, please.

Speaker 5
We're monitoring a reaction.

Speaker 4
Start analysis.

Speaker 5
Right.

Speaker 4
The probe has imploded due to the extreme pressure. Did you get it?

Speaker 10
Just barely. The pattern is blue.

Speaker 4
Then there's no doubt. It's an angel. This laboratory is now under the jurisdiction of Nerve. There will be no unauthorized phone calls. Any access to the outside world is prohibited, and all records pertaining to these events will be classified top secret. Katsuragi here. I need an A-17 from Commander Ikari, top priority.

Speaker 9
Watch what you're saying, Captain. This isn't a secure line.

Speaker 4
I know that. Switch me to a scramble line immediately. An A-17? You want to make an offensive attack? That is correct. No, it's too dangerous. Have you forgotten

Speaker 11
what happened 15 years ago? No, but consider this. This is our chance to move from a state of perpetual defense to an offensive posture. The risk would be enormous. However, I'm sure that you must be aware of how important it is to obtain a living angel as a sample, am I correct? We will not tolerate failure.

Speaker 9
Failure. If we fail, it will result in the extinction of the entire human race. Are you really going to do it, Commander?

Speaker 8
Is that an angel? Yes, it's some sort of chrysalis form that precedes the adult stage we're familiar with. This operation's prime objective will be to capture this angel. We must capture it alive and in a form as close to its original state as possible. And if we fail? Then you must destroy it immediately. Understood? Roger! The designated pilot

Speaker 2
will be... Oh, take me, please! I love to go

Speaker 8
diving! It's going to be me,

Speaker 1
as always.

Speaker 2
Asuka.

Speaker 8
Huh? You will carry out the mission.

Speaker 2
Sure! It's gonna be

Speaker 8
easy! And me? The special equipment we'll be using hasn't been standardized for use in the prototype. Ray and Unit Zero will remain here on standby. I see. Oh, poor

Speaker 2
little Ray. She doesn't get to have any fun.

Speaker 8
Now that an A-17 has been ordered, we've got to roll out immediately. Get ready. Roger.

Speaker 2
Huh? You know, this heat-resistant entry-plug suit doesn't seem any different from our regular ones. Press the switch on your right wrist. Okay. Oh,

Speaker 8
what?!

Speaker 2
I'm I'm

Speaker 3
so disappointed. I was looking forward to seeing you in action. He's there behind

Speaker 2
Opa-loopa! Dr. Akagi, I just can't let Kashi see me in this awful looking thing! Are we having problems down there?

Speaker 8
Sort of, yes. Excuse me, but I could... I will go in Unit 2.

Speaker 2
Oh no, you don't! The only way you're using my Unit 2 is over my dead body! I'd rather do it than let her take my place! I'm sorry, Leapkin. They made me do it!

Speaker 4
AVA Units 1 and 2 have arrived. Have both units stand by. Reposition the laser board and stand ready on the crane.

Speaker 1
Roger.

Speaker 4
Hey,

Speaker 2
is Kaji here yet?

Speaker 4
God's gift won't be coming. He's got no business here.

Speaker 2
No, but I wanted him to see me in my greatest triumph to date.

Speaker 7
An A-17 has been ordered. This will include a freeze of all assets.

Speaker 3
So that means that some people will be in trouble.

Speaker 7
Why didn't you try to stop them?

Speaker 3
I had no way of stopping this. This order was an official one, you know.

Speaker 7
But you must know that if Nerve fails at this, the entire world will perish.

Speaker 3
Don't worry. Not even they are that arrogant.

Speaker 1
What are those jets?

Speaker 8
The UN and the Air Force will be standing by. Until this mission's over, anyway. Are they here to help us? No. They're here to clean up the mess. Just in case we fail.

Speaker 2
What do you mean?

Speaker 8
They'll use N2 depth charges to destroy the Angel. And us as well. This job sucks! What kind of

Speaker 10
a jerk would order something like that?

Speaker 8
Commander Ikari.

Speaker 5
Huh? Laser operation complete.

Speaker 3
The board path has been secured.

Speaker 5
The Type-D equipment is functioning

normally. Unit 2 is ready and in position.

Speaker 4
Understood. Asuka, are you ready? Ready when you are. Let's do it!

Speaker 2
Oh man, talk about hot. Unit

Speaker 5
two is entering the lava.

Speaker 2
Hey, look at this Shinji. Huh? A perfect inner dive. Depth 170. Rate of descent 20. No problems detected. Visibility is zero. I can't see a thing. Switching to CT monitor. Even with this I can barely see a thing.

Speaker 5
Depth is 400. 450. 500. 550. 600. 650. 900, 950, 1000, 1050. We're over the maximum safety depth. Depth is 1300. Unit has reached estimated target level.

Speaker 4
Asuka, what do you see? I'm not detecting anything. It's not here.

Speaker 8
The lava currents must be faster than we

Speaker 4
thought.

Speaker 8
The target's velocity certainly doesn't match our predictions.

Speaker 4
Hurry up and recalculate. Descend further. Continue the operation. Huh? Depth is 1350.

Speaker 4
1400. A crack has occurred on the second coolant pipe. Depth is 1480.

Speaker 5
We have exceeded the maximum allowed depth.

Speaker 4
But we haven't made contact with the target yet. Keep going. How's it going, Asuka? Nice and toasty. I just want to finish this and take a shower. There's a nice hot spring near here. We'll go there once this is over. Just hang in there a little

Speaker 5
longer. Maximum allowed depth plus 120. Ava Unit 2 has lost its progressive knife. Maximum allowed depth plus 200. Captain Katsuragi, you've got to stop this. Have you

Speaker 4
forgotten that there's a human

Speaker 12
being

Speaker 4
in there? I will manage this operation as I see fit. Continue to descend. I agree with Misato. I'm okay. I can go on.

Speaker 5
Depth 1780. Unit has reached the corrected target depth. Wait. I see it.

Speaker 4
The target is

Speaker 3
in sight.

Speaker 13
Prepare for capture.

Speaker 8
All right, because of the convection current that's moving both you and the target, you'll have

Speaker 13
just one chance to make contact. I understand. Just leave it to me.

Speaker 9
30 meters to contact.

Speaker 13
Relative velocity 2.2 on the axis. The electromagnetic cage has been spread. No problems detected. The target has been captured.

Speaker 4
Nice work, Asuka.

Speaker 2
The operation is completed. I'm beginning my ascent. Oscar, are you alright? Well, of course I am. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. This was easy. Man, this isn't an entry plug suit. It's a sauna bath. Oh, I just want to go and take a cold shower.

Speaker 8
Sounds like the tension let loose all at once. Yeah. Were you scared about this operation? I sure was.

Speaker 4
Well, yeah. If something had gone wrong, it could have been another--

Speaker 8
I know. Second impact. All over again.

Speaker 10
It's going crazy! Oh, no! It started to hatch! It's earlier than we predicted! Cage status! There's no way it can

Speaker 3
handle this!

Speaker 4
Abort the capture! Jettison the cage! Damn! We're changing the operation. We've got to destroy that angel. Unit 2, prepare for combat! Do it, Oscar! You got it!

Speaker 2
Damn it! I forgot that I dropped the frog knife! The angel! Releasing holster! It's fast! This is no

Speaker 1
good.

Speaker 12
I've

Speaker 2
lost it again. And if this lousy visibility wasn't bad enough, I'm also too hot in this disgusting suit stuck to my body with sweat. This really sucks.

Speaker 4
Asuka! We're going to drop you Unit 1's progressive knife. Stand ready. Understood. Huh? Oh, jeez! Drop it now, Shinji! Here it comes! 40 seconds to knife arrival. The angel is approaching rapidly!

Speaker 12
Fuck off! Go away! Hurry up with that thing! No! Fall faster! What

Speaker 10
the hell?! No! How could it open its mouth in molten lava?

Speaker 5
What do you think that thing's built out of?

Speaker 10
*Gasps* Of course! The coolant! Transfer all of the internal

Speaker 2
coolant pressure to camel number 3! Do it! *BANG* That's it. I'm done for. Shinji! Idiot. You show off.

Speaker 14
Hello? Are the people from Nerve here somewhere?

Speaker 5
Yeah, we're here!

Speaker 14
I need your signature here. Thank you. Have a nice day.

Speaker 10
It's from Kaji. What is this?

Speaker 1
The springs are over that way. Ah, this feels

Speaker 5
like heaven.

Speaker 2
Oh, boy, I never thought a bath could feel this good.

Speaker 4
Shinji, can you hear me? Yes, ma'am! Would you be a dear and throw me the body shampoo? We ran out of hours! Sure. Here it comes.

Speaker 2
Roger!

Speaker 4
Ow! You

Speaker 2
idiot! What were you throwing, you dark? Oh, t-t

Speaker 12
-sorry.

Speaker 2
He hit me in my most

Speaker 4
private part. Oh, let me take a look. Oh,

Speaker 2
watch your fingers!

Speaker 4
Wow, your skin is so soft and

Speaker 2
smooth, Oscar. Don't! You're tickling me! How do you like this?

Speaker 4
Oh, don't touch me there! Oh, come on, what gives?

Speaker 5
Ah! Thermal expansion. How embarrassing.

Speaker 4
Hm? Oh, the scar. It's something that happened during the second impact. You know my past. About everything, don't you? Well, it's part of my job. It's all ancient history now. We really ought to let it go.

Speaker 6
Oh, my God. Another one, darling kiss me Fill my heart with songs and let me sing forevermore You are all I know for all I want, sing another door In other words, please be true. In other words, I

Speaker 4
love you. When Sabotage cuts off all the power to Tokyo 3, Nerve HQ is left open to attack by a new angel. Without power or any modern support facilities, the three pilots must find a way to launch the Avas and do battle in total darkness. Don't miss the next exciting episode!
