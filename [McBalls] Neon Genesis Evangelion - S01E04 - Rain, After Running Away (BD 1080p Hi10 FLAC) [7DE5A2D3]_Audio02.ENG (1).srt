1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,520
Speaker 1: As a cruel, a man like a man,

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,660
Speaker 1: a man, you become a man.

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,180
Speaker 1: The blue wind is now,

4
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,900
Speaker 1: but I'm still holding my eyes.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,100
Speaker 1: I'm just looking at the moment

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,600
Speaker 1: You are smiling

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,020
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to touch

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
Speaker 1: I'm just curious

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,420
Speaker 1: I'm still not sure

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,140
Speaker 1: I'm still not sure

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,320
Speaker 1: But I'll see you soon

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,020
Speaker 1: The back of the back of

13
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,180
Speaker 1: "Signan you, you're a fairy tale"

14
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,020
Speaker 2: Shinji, wake up.

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,080
Speaker 2: How long are you going to avoid school?

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
Speaker 2: It's been five days now.

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,500
Speaker 2: Unit one's already completely repaired.

18
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,560
Speaker 2: You're the pilot.

19
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,100
Speaker 2: Are you going to leave it sitting there?

20
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,840
Speaker 2: Shinji!

21
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,100
Speaker 2: Huh?

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,160
Speaker 2: Huh?

23
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,180
Speaker 2: He's run away. I'm not surprised.

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,040
Speaker 2: Shenjing!

25
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,780
Speaker 3: - Well,

26
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,180
Speaker 4: um...

27
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,160
Speaker 4: - Pardon me, ma'am, but we're Shinji's classmates,

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,560
Speaker 4: Ida and Suzuhara.

29
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,500
Speaker 4: - Ida and Suzuhara?

30
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,060
Speaker 3: - Yeah. - Yes, ma'am.

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,700
Speaker 4: I'm Suzuhara.

32
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 4: - Oh, aren't you the ones who got in Unit 1's entry

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,240
Speaker 5: plug?

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,040
Speaker 5: - Yes, ma'am.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,440
Speaker 5: We're

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,340
Speaker 6: really sorry for causing so much trouble.

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,720
Speaker 2: The reason

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,860
Speaker 6: we came here today is that Shinji's been absent

39
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,060
Speaker 6: ever since then, so we came to see if he was okay.

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,920
Speaker 2: Well, Shinji's... he's at the nerve training facility right now.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,460
Speaker 4: Oh, I see.

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,500
Speaker 4: These are the printouts that were building up on Shinji's desk.

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,260
Speaker 2: Oh, sorry for your trouble.

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,180
Speaker 4: Thank you.

45
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,960
Speaker 4: Well, we'll just

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Speaker 6: be leaving now.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,520
Speaker 4: Please say hi to Shinji for us.

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,840
Speaker 4: Yeah, I will. Bye.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,420
Speaker 4: This is an unexpected development.

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,860
Speaker 4: She was a real babe, wasn't she?

51
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,300
Speaker 4: Hmm.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,320
Speaker 2: Hmm.

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,440
*Sigh*

54
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,420
*Splash*

55
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,680
*Splash*

56
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:57,960
*Splash*

57
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,020
Speaker 7: Thank you for using the Tokyo-3 loop line.

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,960
This train will be going out of service at this station.

59
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,900
Speaker 7: Please, make sure you take all of your belongings with you as you exit the train.

60
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,420
Speaker 7: Thank you for using Tokyo Loop Line.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,080
Speaker 8: I ought to go back.

62
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,940
Speaker 7: *Squeak

63
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,640
Speaker 7: No, there's

64
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
Speaker 1: still a tidal wave of

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Speaker 9: pushing at 230 meters a second.

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
Speaker 9: Doctor, we must evacuate.

67
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,440
Speaker 9: No, it's my duty to remain here.

68
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,960
Speaker 9: Doctor, you think death is easy, but you

69
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,540
Speaker 3: have an obligation to watch this

70
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,440
Speaker 2: living hell.

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,900
Speaker 2: Hmm.

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,080
Speaker 3: *Gasp

73
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,480
*

74
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,480
-

75
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,460
-

76
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,140
Speaker 2: But he's only 14 years old.

77
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,460
Speaker 2: Making him bear the burden of the future of mankind seems so cruel.

78
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,760
Speaker 2: But we have to use 14-year-old children to pilot the Avas.

79
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,960
Speaker 2: I know.

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Speaker 2: But...

81
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,260
Speaker 2: So has he called or made contact?

82
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:35,880
Speaker 2: Nothing?

83
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,419
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.

84
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:39,820
Speaker 2: Nothing.

85
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,539
Speaker 2: I don't think he's going to come back this time.

86
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,680
Speaker 2: What will you do?

87
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:45,900
Speaker 2: Nothing.

88
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,900
Speaker 2: It's better for him if he doesn't come back.

89
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,680
Speaker 2: But why?

90
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,660
Speaker 2: Because of what happened after the last battle.

91
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,440
Speaker 2: Why did you ignore my orders?

92
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,840
Speaker 8: I apologize.

93
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,540
Speaker 2: I'm the one who's in charge of your operations, aren't I?

94
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,160
Speaker 8: Yes.

95
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Speaker 2: You do know you're supposed to obey my orders.

96
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,480
Speaker 2: Understand?

97
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,220
Speaker 8: Yes.

98
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,740
Speaker 8: I'm

99
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,200
Speaker 2: warning you not to do it again.

100
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,020
Speaker 8: Yes.

101
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,520
Speaker 8: Hey,

102
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,480
Speaker 2: are you even listening to anything I'm saying?

103
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,520
Speaker 8: Yes.

104
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,700
Speaker 2: Oh, no, you don't.

105
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,220
Speaker 2: You're not going to get out of this by just saying yes to everything I say.

106
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,120
Speaker 8: I know, Miss Misato.

107
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,780
Speaker 8: We won, didn't we?

108
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:24,940
Speaker 8: Isn't that enough?

109
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,800
Speaker 2: You know, it may seem easy going

110
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,780
Speaker 8: along with whatever anyone else wants,

111
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,080
Speaker 8: but if

112
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,820
Speaker 2: you get into an Ava with that attitude, it'll kill you.

113
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,700
Speaker 8: You know, I just don't care anymore.

114
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,640
Speaker 2: It'd be nice if I could say you've got the right attitude,

115
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,980
Speaker 2: but if you think you're going to get any praise out of me,

116
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,280
Speaker 2: you're wrong, Shinji.

117
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,580
Speaker 8: That's not the point.

118
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
Speaker 8: Anyway, I'm the only one who can pilot it.

119
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,540
Speaker 8: I'll just have to do.

120
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,560
Speaker 8: I see.

121
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,380
Speaker 2: If getting into the Eva means nothing but pain to him,

122
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,460
Speaker 2: I don't think he should pilot again.

123
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,300
Speaker 2: Otherwise, he'll be killed.

124
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,380
Speaker 7: But we need pilots.

125
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,180
Speaker 4: Captain!

126
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,760
Speaker 4: Ida, go on ahead!

127
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,360
Speaker 4: But I can't go on and leave you behind like this!

128
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,720
Speaker 4: What will I do?

129
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,160
Speaker 4: You fool!

130
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,740
Speaker 4: There.

131
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,120
Speaker 4: Hmm?

132
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,480
Speaker 4: The new kid!

133
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,000
Speaker 4: Ikari!

134
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,220
Speaker 4: Hmm?

135
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,220
Speaker 4: Toji was real sorry about everything.

136
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,120
Speaker 4: His kid's sister really tore him a new one.

137
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,460
Speaker 4: She said that it was the robot who saved her lives.

138
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,860
Speaker 4: That must be pretty embarrassing,

139
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,580
Speaker 4: getting herself chewed out by a second grader, right?

140
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
Speaker 4: Hmm, I like it out here at night,

141
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
Speaker 4: because those noisy cicadas don't chirp.

142
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
Speaker 4: It was pretty quiet when I was a kid,

143
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,920
Speaker 4: but there are tons of them now.

144
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,240
Speaker 4: - Misato said that the ecosystem is returning

145
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,240
Speaker 4: to its former state.

146
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,060
Speaker 4: - Misato said so, hmm?

147
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,500
Speaker 4: I really envy you.

148
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,640
Speaker 4: I mean, you live with such a beautiful woman,

149
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,860
Speaker 4: and you get to pile up the Evangelion.

150
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,520
Speaker 4: Oh, man.

151
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,740
Speaker 4: I wish I could get inside that lovely cockpit just once.

152
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,280
Speaker 8: You really shouldn't, you know.

153
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,440
Speaker 10: Your mother would probably be worried.

154
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,420
Speaker 10: Huh?

155
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,980
Speaker 10: Oh, don't worry about my mother.

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,740
Speaker 10: I don't have one of those.

157
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,760
Speaker 10: Oh.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 4: I'm no different from you.

159
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,460
Speaker 4: Huh.

160
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,080
Speaker 4: You'll take something to eat, won't you?

161
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,000
Speaker 10: Yeah. Do you usually do things like this?

162
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,540
Speaker 10: Well, sure.

163
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,560
Speaker 10: Is it some kind of training for guerrilla warfare or something?

164
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,760
Speaker 10: How could I fight with toys like

165
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,480
Speaker 4: these? It's just for fun.

166
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 9: - You're Shinji Akari, aren't you?

167
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,300
Speaker 8: - Yes.

168
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,940
Speaker 9: from the Nerve Security Intelligence.

169
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,040
Speaker 9: Under Security Clause Article 8,

170
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,900
Speaker 9: we're taking you to Nerve Headquarters, all right?

171
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,080
Speaker 9: - Yes.

172
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,640
Speaker 4: - And all you did was stand there?

173
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,480
Speaker 4: - That's easy for you to say,

174
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,160
Speaker 4: but they were Nerve Intelligence professionals.

175
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,120
Speaker 4: - So what about it?

176
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,820
Speaker 4: Geez, don't you have any balls at all?

177
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,440
Speaker 11: - Girl, pervert, ape.

178
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,620
Speaker 4: Only an idiot fights when he knows you can't win.

179
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,740
Speaker 4: Balls have nothing to do with it.

180
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Speaker 2: - Long time no see.

181
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,360
Speaker 8: - Yeah.

182
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,460
Speaker 2: - Do you feel any better after wandering around

183
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,300
Speaker 2: for two days?

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
Speaker 8: - I don't know.

185
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,060
Speaker 2: - The Ava is on standby.

186
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,920
Speaker 2: Will you pilot it or won't you?

187
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Speaker 8: You're not going to scold me for running away?

188
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,880
Speaker 8: Of course you're not. I'm no relation to you, am I?

189
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,620
Speaker 8: If I say that I won't pilot Unit 1, what are you going to do with it?

190
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,240
Speaker 2: I suppose that Rey will do it. You won't pilot it?

191
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,740
Speaker 8: It seems a little bit unrealistic for you to force everything on her.

192
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,500
Speaker 8: Don't worry. I'll pilot it.

193
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,860
Speaker 8: But you don't want to do it.

194
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,660
Speaker 8: Of course not. It's not something that comes to me naturally.

195
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,400
Speaker 8: But Ayanami and you

196
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,940
Speaker 1: and Miss Riosko...

197
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
Speaker 1: Stow that line of crap!

198
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,940
Speaker 8: This has nothing to do

199
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,900
Speaker 2: with any of us.

200
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,720
Speaker 2: If you don't like it, get out of here.

201
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Speaker 2: Just forget all about Ava and us and go back where you came from.

202
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,480
Speaker 2: We don't need someone with that attitude piloting.

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,960
Speaker 7: You do know that the third child is leaving Tokyo 3 tomorrow, don't you?

204
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,760
Speaker 12: We'll reconfigure Unit 1's system for Rei.

205
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,980
Speaker 12: Regardless of the results of the Unit 0 reactivation experiments, we'll move on to experimenting on Unit 1.

206
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,700
Speaker 12: According to the Marduk Organization's report, the fourth child hasn't been found yet.

207
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,580
Speaker 5: Does that mean we can't get any more pilot recruits?

208
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,420
Speaker 8: Uh, excuse me. Where is Miss Misato? I'd like to say goodbye.

209
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,320
Speaker 9: You are no longer NERV personnel, therefore we can't give you that information.

210
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,160
Speaker 6: - Hey, Cory!

211
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:47,780
Speaker 3: - Huh?

212
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,060
Speaker 3: You

213
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,140
Speaker 6: left this stuff behind me?

214
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,280
Speaker 6: Oh!

215
00:15:59,130 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 8: Uh, excuse

216
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,240
Speaker 4: me.

217
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,860
Speaker 10: Could I--

218
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,200
Speaker 10: Um...

219
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,300
Speaker 4: - I'll be back. - Oh, I'm back.

220
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,360
Speaker 4: Oh, I

221
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Speaker 10: Well, thank you.

222
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,240
Speaker 4: Hey,

223
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,960
Speaker 10: Toji! Come on,

224
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,540
Speaker 6: say something!

225
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,040
Speaker 6: - Kari,

226
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,180
Speaker 6: look, I'm sorry about hitting you twice. Please, you gotta hit me back. - I can't

227
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,960
Speaker 6: do that! - You gotta, otherwise

228
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,780
Speaker 4: I won't be satisfied. - He's a

229
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,940
Speaker 4: pretty embarrassing guy, isn't he? But if it'll put an end to this dispute, why don't you go ahead and hit him?

230
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,920
Speaker 6: - But I...

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,200
Speaker 6: - Hurry up! You don't have much time, do you?

232
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,720
Speaker 8: - Okay, but only once.

233
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,720
Speaker 8: - Right, come on!

234
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,760
Speaker 3: Hey, wait!

235
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,940
Speaker 6: Don't

236
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,520
hold back.

237
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,980
Speaker 4: - Ooh, that hurt.

238
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,319
Speaker 4: - How do you know I'd be here?

239
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,040
Speaker 4: - It was just a hunch.

240
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
Speaker 4: We've seen lots of other classmates off before.

241
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,079
Speaker 4: It's getting to be a regular thing.

242
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,760
Speaker 6: - Of course, if you're leaving, you know, we'll have to leave this city sometime soon.

243
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,839
Speaker 6: But we can't really blame you for that.

244
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,040
Speaker 6: I mean, we saw how you suffered in the Eva.

245
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,300
Speaker 6: And anyway, if anyone does try to blame you,

246
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,140
Speaker 6: I'm gonna give him a whop on the head!

247
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,060
Speaker 6: Come on! Try not to look so gloomy!

248
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,740
Speaker 6: Take care, Ikari.

249
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,180
Speaker 6: Yeah, take care.

250
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,140
Speaker 6: Well, uh…

251
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,340
Speaker 9: Your time is up.

252
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:43,600
Speaker 6: Huh?

253
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:10,900
Speaker 8: - Hey!

254
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,340
Speaker 8: The one who deserved to be hit, not you!

255
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,980
Speaker 8: I'm a coward!

256
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,300
Speaker 3: I'm dishonest!

257
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,380
Speaker 1: I'm sneaky!

258
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,440
Speaker 1: And a wimp!

259
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,540
Speaker 9: Don't give us any more trouble.

260
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,420
Speaker 9: Jeez!

261
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,820
Speaker 2: Well,

262
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,620
Speaker 7: he's gone.

263
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,340
Speaker 7: Do you really think this is for the best?

264
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,300
Speaker 2: The hedgehog's dilemma.

265
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,620
Speaker 2: The closer we become, the more deeply we hurt.

266
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,800
Speaker 2: Now I understand.

267
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,380
Speaker 2: I finally understand.

268
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,180
Speaker 2: He can't let others know how he feels in any other way.

269
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,760
Speaker 11: Express linear train bound for Atsuki is arriving on track two.

-

276
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,340
Speaker 3: Hmm.

277
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,160
Speaker 3: Huh?

278
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,000
Speaker 3: Hmm.

279
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,780
Speaker 3: Huh?

280
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,160
Speaker 3: The local train bound for Gora is now arriving

281
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,000

Speaker 2: Welcome home.

289
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,420
Speaker 5: Fly me to the moon

290
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,400
Speaker 5: And let me play

291
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,740
Speaker 5: Among the stars

292
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,600
Speaker 5: Let me see what's playing

293
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,780
Speaker 5: It's like on Jupiter and Mars

294
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,240
Speaker 5: In other words

295
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,440
Speaker 5: Hold my hand

296
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,960
Speaker 5: In other words, darling, kiss me

297
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,980
Speaker 5: Fill my heart with song

298
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,880
Speaker 5: Oh, let me sing forevermore

299
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,940
Speaker 5: You are all I long for, all I worship and adore

300
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,840
Speaker 5: In other words, please be true

301
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,600
Speaker 5: In other words,

302
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,980
I love you

303
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,480
Speaker 2: Re Ayanami seems cold and distant, yet she seems to have a relationship with Commander Ikari.

304
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,880
Speaker 2: Shinji doesn't understand how this can be, but before he can find out more,

305
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,340
Speaker 2: a beam shot by the fifth angel strikes Ava Unit 1 in the chest.

306
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,580
Speaker 2: Will this episode be

307
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,380
Speaker 3: Shinji's last?
