1
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,139
.

2
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,680
So, this is Dr. Katsuragi's super solenoid theory.

3
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
This whole thing just seems so untenable.

4
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,880
That's why it's a theory and not a principle.

5
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,960
Not to mention that it's

6
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,020
already been proven,

7
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,580
even

8
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,800
if it was by accident.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,420
We have proof of its existence.

10
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,280
Well, the S2 theory is the only feasible explanation of the source of that monster's power.

11
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,480
Yeah, well, I'll believe it when the data is actually verified.

12
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,180
What's the status of the lines of longevity?

13
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,740
Man, I wish the smoking corner wasn't so far away.

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,740
Be happy they gave us a corner.

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,620
Originally they said the whole facility was going to be non-smoking.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,860
No way they

17
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,720
could kiss my bucket.

18
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,800
Bye, I can't function without nicotine.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,080
God,

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,040
it's freezing.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,540
The food sucks.

22
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,580
This place truly is the armpit of the world.

23
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,580
Aw, jeez, not the A lunch menu again.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,040
I

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,860
would kill for some good Osaka sushi right now.

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,880
Cut that surface light!

27
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,820
It's exceeding the projected growth limitations!

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,940
Atoms genetic structures

29
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,460
are undergoing fusion!

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,360
The AT field is spread to maximum

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,800
capacity!

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,360
God,

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,300
put the lance back!

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,200
It's no good!

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,920
The magnetic field is too weak!

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,800
It's sinking!

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,700
Do whatever you can to minimize the damage!

38
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,620
Commence the subatomic structure analysis.

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,520
Hurry up!

40
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,860
When the guff opens, commence heat dissipation!

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,420
A tenth of a second is long enough!

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,940
It's walking!

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:32,780
Incredible!

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,700
The anti-AT field is causing too much interference.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,160
The energy is escaping!

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,740
Surface team has given us a visual confirmation on walking.

47
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,300
Transformation measures have been initiated.

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,100
Commence countdown!

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,720
The wings are going to spread!

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,280
Evacuate to the surface!

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,620
*crying*

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,160
Ritsuko must be thinking I'm pretty disgusting.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Appearing to give in to our sexual desires makes for a more realistic appearance.

54
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,540
A good deception.

55
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,620
To deceive the intelligence department?

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,880
Or the commander in Ritsuko.

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,180
Or me.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
No, no. Others.

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,520
You wanna fool the others?

60
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,500
You never show interest in others, but you want their attention.

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,740
You really are just like my dad.

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,480
Hmph.

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,060
So, tomorrow I'll be in Japan.

64
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,780
Misato said she'll come to pick me up at noon.

65
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,580
I guess I won't be seeing you for a while.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,160
How dull.

67
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,600
Once you get to Japan, I'm sure you'll have lots of new boyfriends.

68
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,859
In fact, I heard the third child is a boy.

69
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,019
I don't care about any stupid little kids.

70
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,340
My heart belongs to you, Kaji.

71
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,700
Mama! Mama! They chose me!

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm an elite pilot now. I'm the best in the whole world.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,460
I must keep this a secret, but I'll only tell you, Mama.

74
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,480
Everybody's so nice to me now. I don't feel lonely anymore.

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,220
I'm okay now, even without my papa around.

76
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,220
Look at me! Look at me, Mama! Look, Mama!

77
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,980
Asuka, your sink ratio has dropped an entire eight points. I need you to concentrate.

78
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm trying to!

79
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,700
Asuka's sink ratio is getting lower and lower. What do you think it means, ma'am?

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,260
It means trouble. We don't have a spare. Let's concentrate our efforts on fixing Unit Zero.

81
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,040
Good morning, Commander. Did you bring you a child today?

82
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,140
Oh, wait. I could have sworn you had a little boy.

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Oh, no. This isn't my son Shinji. I've decided to take care of the child of an acquaintance. Her name is Rei Ayanami.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,380
Well, hello there, Rei.

85
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,120
It's no use. This is dumb. I shouldn't have come here.

86
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,120
Maybe I should find a shelter or something.

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,160
Ah!

88
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,520
Ah!

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,780
Ah!

90
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,820
*crying*

92
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,480
and whether I live or die makes no great difference.

93
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,440
The one truth the Lilin have never been able to grasp

94
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,080
is that death may be the only absolute freedom there ever was.

95
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,420
What are you?

96
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,760
Garu, I don't understand what you're talking about.

97
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,400
Nothing makes any sense.

98
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,040
This is my wish.

99
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,800
I want you to destroy me.

100
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,780
Otherwise, you will be destroyed.

101
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Only one life form can be chosen to evade the destruction and seize the future.

102
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,020
future.

103
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,540
*Sounds of the

104
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,340
The signal's not working!

105
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,560
His field's not up! It's not unfolding!

106
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,820
It's not up?!

107
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,240
Status report!

108
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,220
The head is damaged!

109
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,620
Extend of damage unknown!

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,120
We're

111
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,780
having trouble maintaining activation!

112
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,940
We're not getting any readings on the pilot!

113
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,360
It's completely out of control!

114
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,900
My god... Berserker...

115
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,380
*Sigh*

116
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,700
It's neutralizing the face space.

117
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,580
No, it's breaking through it!

118
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Eva's true form.

119
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,100
They should have delivered all your stuff by now, Shinji.

120
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,220
Don't mind the mess. I just moved in here myself, you know.

121
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,620
Hey, come in.

122
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,960
Oh, I don't want to intrude.

123
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Shinji, this is your home now.

124
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm... I'm home.

125
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,020
Welcome home.

126
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,020
Who is she?

127
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,540
The only survivor of the research team.

128
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,020
She hasn't said a word in two years.

129
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,740
How terrible.

130
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,040
She saw hell firsthand.

131
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,460
Physical wounds could be healed,

132
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,160
but repairing the damage to her mind could take time.

133
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,480
Her name is

134
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,100
Katsuragi.

135
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,260
Misato,

136
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,760
you said?

137
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,580
Yep. Misato Katsuragi, pleased to meet you.

138
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,200
Dear Mother,

139
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,120
I have just become acquainted with a girl named Katsuragi.

140
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,760
I understand she is the sole survivor from the original research team.

141
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,160
She used to be mute, but she talks almost constantly now,

142
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,300
like she's trying to make up for lost time.

143
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,660
Do I want to be good?

144
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,980
I have to be a good girl.

145
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,340
Because I have no daddy.

146
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,600
Because I have to be good and not bother my

147
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,020
mommy.

148
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,900
But I don't want to become like my mom.

149
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,940
When my father is not here, she always

150
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,580
cries.

151
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,760
I can't cry.

152
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,540
I can't depend on anyone else.

153
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,740
So I have to be good.

154
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,380
Maybe my father won't hate me if I be good.

155
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,820
But I hate my father, and I hated being a good girl.

156
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,820
I hate it. I'm tired of it.

157
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,260
Misato used to go out with Kaji?

158
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,840
I don't really like her. Her lifestyle is a little bit much.

159
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
Misato Katsuraki.

160
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,600
She's not a bad person.

161
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,560
So much has happened since I came.

162
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,300
Before this, I lived with my teacher.

163
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,660
It was calm and boring in those days.

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,420
I wasn't really doing anything.

165
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,840
But I was fine with that.

166
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,640
There was really nothing that I had to do.

167
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,740
Did you hate dealing with people?

168
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:29,980
More or less.

169
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,000
But

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,560
I didn't

171
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,520
really care as much.

172
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,100
However, I really hated my father.

173
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,040
You know, I can't help but wonder why Shinji agreed to pilot again.

174
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,800
It seems that he simply does what he's told to do.

175
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,220
I suppose that's just his way of getting through life.

176
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,400
Position target in the center.

177
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,360
Pull the switch.

178
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,880
Position target in the center.

179
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:54,800
Pull the switch.

180
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,160
Position target in the center.

181
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,080
Pull the switch.

182
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,160
I mustn't run away.

183
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,300
I mustn't run away.

184
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,380
I mustn't run away! I mustn't run away!

185
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,680
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

186
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,640
Today the fourth Angel attacked out of the blue.

187
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,700
Unit One intercepted the Angel and destroyed it.

188
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,280
Shinji, wake up!

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
How long are you going to avoid school?

190
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,360
It's been five days now.

191
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,100
Unit 1 is already completely repaired.

192
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,520
You're the pilot. Are you going to just leave it sitting there?

193
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,500
Shinji!

194
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,900
It's been raining for the past four days in a row.

195
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,640
Work on the sample analysis has been postponed due to the weather.

196
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,580
Other than that, nothing else to write about.

197
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,320
Well, the sun finally came out for a while today.

198
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,920
But overall, it was partly cloudy.

199
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,500
Nothing else to write about today.

200
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,300
I like it out here at night.

201
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,740
Because those noisy cicadas don't chirp.

202
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,460
It was pretty quiet when I was a kid.

203
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,740
But there's tons of them now.

204
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,840
Misato said that the ecosystem was returning to its former state.

205
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,520
Misato said so, huh?

206
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,280
I really envy you.

207
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,100
I mean, you live with such a beautiful woman.

208
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,540
And you get to pilot the Evangelion.

209
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,220
The Eva is on standby.

210
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,940
Will you pilot

211
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,080
it?

212
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,440
Or won't you?

213
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,060
You're not going to scold me for running away?

214
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,700
Of course you're not. I'm no relation to you, am I?

215
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,840
If I say that I won't pilot Unit 1, what are you going to do with it?

216
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,300
I suppose that Ray will do it. So you won't pilot it?

217
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,840
It seems a little bit unrealistic for you to force everything on her.

218
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,060
Don't worry. I'll pilot it.

219
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
But you don't want to do it.

220
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,320
Of course not. It's not something that comes to me naturally.

221
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,720
But Ayanami and you and Ms. Ritsuko...

222
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Stole that line of crap! This has nothing to do with any of us!

223
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,480
If you don't like it, get out of here!

224
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,020
Just forget all about Eva and us and go back where you came from!

225
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,080
We don't need someone with that attitude piloting.

226
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,280
Of course, if you're leaving, we'll have to leave this city sometime soon.

227
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,140
But we can't really blame you for that. I mean, we saw how you suffered in the Ava.

228
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,380
And anyway, if anyone does try to blame you, I'm gonna give them a bop on the head.

229
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,860
I'm the one who deserved to be hit, not you!

230
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm a coward!

231
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,060
I'm dishonest!

232
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,140
I'm sneaky!

233
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,520
And a wimp!

234
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,380
Shinji, you mustn't run away.

235
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,800
You must confront your father.

236
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,100
And you must confront yourself.

237
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,600
Shinji,

238
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,260
are you sure about this?

239
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,180
I don't mind living alone. And besides, I'm alone anyway.

240
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,780
It's awesome! The buildings are growing!

241
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,520
Of course, if you're leaving, we'll have to leave this city sometime soon.

242
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,380
But we can't really blame you for that. I mean, we saw how you suffered in the Eva.

243
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,740
And anyway, if anyone does try to blame you, I'm gonna give them a bop on the head!

244
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,800
This is our

245
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,100
city,

246
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,540
and it's the city you saved.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
I forgot to tell you something.

248
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,840
You did something very good and very noble today.

249
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,160
You should be proud.

250
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,460
Good night, Shinji.

251
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,200
Hang in there.

252
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,820
*Gasp*

253
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,760
We believe that mental and physical exhaustion were causing a strain on the third child's health.

254
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,300
He was given four days leave.

255
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,580
His status has returned to normal.

256
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,500
No further problems.

257
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,500
I... I'm home.

258
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,040
Welcome

259
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,380
home.

260
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,720
Good morning, Ikari.

261
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,700
Good morning.

262
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
What are we working on today?

263
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,940
Pachelbel's Cannon.

264
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,580
Cello's so easy.

265
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,880
All you have to do is play arpeggios.

266
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,940
*cough*

267
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,660
*Sigh*

268
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,200
Mama... Mama...

269
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,040
So,

270
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,140
you're just a kid yourself.

271
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,420
Well, hello, Miss Sato. How have you

272
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,720
been?

273
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,580
Just fine. Goodness, you've grown some, haven't you?

274
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,880
Uh-huh. And I'm not just taller. My figure's filled out as well.

275
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,840
Let me introduce you. Shinji,

276
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,400
this is the designated pilot of EVA Unit 2, the second child.

277
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,840
Asuka Langley Soryu.

278
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,260
You are extremely afraid of any kind of initial contact, aren't you?

279
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,580
Are you that afraid of other people?

280
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,420
I know that by keeping others at a distance, you avoid a betrayal of your trust.

281
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,420
But while you may not be hurt that way, you mustn't forget that you must endure the loneliness.

282
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,500
Man can never completely erase this sadness, because all men are fundamentally alone.

283
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,160
Pain is something that man must endure in his heart.

284
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,120
And since the heart feels pain so easily, some believe life is pain.

285
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,860
So, what do you think about Shinji Ikari?

286
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,100
Oh,

287
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,740
the great third child? He's boring.

288
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,380
And

289
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,900
yet his synchronization ratio was over 40% with no prior training.

290
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,680
Sync ratio zero.

291
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,040
Hey, third child!

292
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,500
Can't be the second child anymore.

293
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,100
You're coming with me.

294
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,440
That's really an interesting color. I didn't know it was red.

295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,440
Units zero and one were the prototype and test type respectively.

296
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,280
The fact that unit one synchronized with an untrained pilot like you is proof of that.

297
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,180
However, Unit 2 is a little different.

298
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,299
My Unit 2 is the world's first real Evangelion!

299
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,620
Created for actual combat conditions,

300
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,300
it's the final production model!

301
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,200
Whoa! What was that?

302
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,060
Undersea shockwaves!

303
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,860
And it sounded close.

304
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
*Sings*

305
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,400
Hello! Guten Morgen, Shinji!

306
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,520
Guten Morgen.

307
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,120
Hey, third child. Why the gloomy face?

308
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,380
I'm the most popular girl in school.

309
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,800
You should appreciate your good fortune.

310
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,020
Hey, the other one's here too, isn't she?

311
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,960
Other one?

312
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,380
What are you, stupid?

313
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm talking about the first child, of course.

314
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,900
Oh, Rei Ayanami.

315
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,620
You must be Rei Ayanami, the pilot of the prototype.

316
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,120
I'm Asuka,

317
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,780
Asuka Langley Soryu.

318
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm the designated pilot of EVA Unit 2. Let's be good friends.

319
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,840
What for?

320
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,120
Because it would be so convenient. You know what I mean.

321
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,580
If I'm ordered 2, I will do it.

322
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,100
Freakazoid.

323
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,880
How are their coordination drills going?

324
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,120
Not very well, as you can see.

325
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,980
*Sigh*

326
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,060
*Sigh*

327
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,380
*Sigh*

328
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,660
Sheist! Well, so much for synchronization!

329
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,280
I could never sink down to the level of this animated turnip!

330
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,080
If you ask me, the whole idea is impossible!

331
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,200
Rain?

332
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,060
Yes ma'am?

333
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,220
Why don't you try it?

334
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,580
*Gasp*

335
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,980
I have no reason left to live.

336
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,600
Nobody cares about me anymore.

337
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,740
I am not a doll.

338
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:55,360
Synchrograph minus 12.8? It's barely over the starting indicator.

339
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,100
That's pathetic. That's a worse score than yesterday.

340
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,640
Asuka

341
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,100
isn't feeling well today. It's her period.

342
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,000
Synch ratios aren't influenced by physical changes.

343
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,640
The problem's deeper in her subconscious.

344
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, Asuka's pride has been badly damaged.

345
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,100
It's hard

346
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,820
to blame her after she was defeated so badly.

347
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,360
What's worse is that she feels as if she was beaten by Shinji.

348
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,900
*Squeak*

349
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,060
If you don't

350
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,420
open your mind to her, your Eva will not move.

351
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,280
You're saying this is my fault?! I blocked myself?!

352
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,420
Yes, the Eva has its own mind.

353
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,720
It's just a big toy.

354
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,980
Then you don't know.

355
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,040
Huh! Now I know something's going on when Wonder Girl starts talking to me.

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,340
What's up? Are you happy that I'm having trouble with my Eva now?

357
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,880
Well, don't worry, 'cause when the next angel comes, our invincible Shinji will ride out and destroy it!

358
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,640
We sweet little girls won't have to fight anymore!

359
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,340
They only need stupid Shinji! I thought it was bad when he was nice,

360
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,520
but when an emotionless wind-up doll like you starts being sympathetic, I'm doomed.

361
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,960
I am not a doll.

362
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,480
You are! You do anything you're ordered to, don't you?

363
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,280
You'd kill yourself if your commander ordered you to, wouldn't you?

364
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,440
Of course.

365
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,440
Good morning.

366
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,460
Hey, Big Shot, what are you staring so intently at?

367
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,480
Uh, nothing.

368
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,380
Not

369
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,180
that my ass,

370
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,360
he's ogling Ray.

371
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,360
I am not.

372
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,540
Oh, come on.

373
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,380
We

374
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,480
saw you looking.

375
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah, at Ray's mammaries.

376
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:27,820
Ah!

377
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,440
Ray's silky thighs, her calves, her

378
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,740
naughty bits.

379
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,040
Look, it's nothing like that.

380
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,860
Then just what

381
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,640
were you looking at?

382
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,760
Yeah, come on, fess up, Shinji.

383
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,580
I was just wondering why she's always alone.

384
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,660
Come to think of it, she hasn't had any friends since she started here in the seventh grade.

385
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
You two are both Ava pilots, right?

386
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,800
You ought to know her better than any of us, Shinji.

387
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:55,820
Know what I

388
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,240
mean?

389
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,100
Yeah, that's right.

390
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,760
I suppose,

391
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,780
but we don't talk.

392
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,560
She's a nice girl, but she's like your father.

393
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,180
She's not very adept at...

394
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,040
She's not very adept at what?

395
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,040
Living, I guess.

396
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,560
Hello there.

397
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm sorry for intruding.

398
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,060
It's me, Shinji Ikari.

399
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,260
I'm coming in, okay?

400
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,420
Really?

401
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,540
These can't be rays.

402
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,700
Ray, I...

403
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,520
I didn't mean to...

404
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,240
No! What?

405
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,760
*cough*

406
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,540
*cough*

407
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,300
*cough*

408
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,100
*cough*

409
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,760
Will you get off?

410
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,320
Oh,

411
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,500
sorry!

412
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,280
What?

413
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,160
Well, I was asked to...

414
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,620
Well, I was asked to, you know, so I...

415
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,620
What was it?

416
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,660
The card! Your card!

417
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,900
It's been renewed.

418
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,640
So I was asked to deliver it.

419
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,900
I didn't mean for any of this to

420
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,140
happen.

421
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,960
Aren't you afraid of piloting Unit Zero?

422
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,340
Why?

423
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,940
Well, I heard that you were hurt pretty bad in an earlier experiment.

424
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,920
So I thought you might be...

425
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,200
You are Commander Ikari's son, aren't you?

426
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,000
Mm-hmm.

427
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,580
It's his project.

428
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,480
Shouldn't you trust him?

429
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,240
No, of course not!

430
00:31:59,840 --> 00:31:59,980
How

431
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,040
could I ever trust him again?

432
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,920
What?

433
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,680
Ayanami.

434
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,040
Pilot Ikari, I've been sent here to brief you on the Operation Yoshima timetables.

435
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,600
The operation will begin at midnight, 0100 hours.

436
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,520
Prior to that, Pilot Ikari and Ayanami will arrive at the cage by 1730.

437
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,160
At 1800, Unit 0 and Unit 1 will activate.

438
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,400
At 1805, both units will be deployed.

439
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,320
They will arrive at the temporary base at Mount Futago at 1830.

440
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,460
There they will await further orders.

441
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,880
Your meal.

442
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,800
I don't feel like eating anything.

443
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,060
We will depart in 60 minutes.

444
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,540
Do I really have to pilot Ava again?

445
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:58,760
Yes, you do.

446
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,500
I don't want to. I don't want to go through it again.

447
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,840
Then you can just stay here in bed.

448
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,620
What do you mean?

449
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,040
I will pilot Ewa Unit 1.

450
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,500
Dr. Akagi is already prepared to rewrite the personal data files for Unit 1.

451
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,400
Ritzko is IT'S

452
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,560
GONE, RESERK! STAY BACK!

453
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,020
Goodbye.

454
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,840
Ayanami, just why do you pilot this thing?

455
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,940
Because I'm bonded to it.

456
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,160
You're bonded?

457
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,300
Yes, it's a bond.

458
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,440
You mean to my father?

459
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,160
To all people.

460
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,720
You're very strong, Rei.

461
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,840
I have nothing else.

462
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,300
Goodbye.

463
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:15,360
Ayanami!

464
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,560
Are you alright?

465
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,080
Ayanami!

466
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,240
Don't ever say that.

467
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,080
That you have nothing else.

468
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,800
Please, just don't say that.

469
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,179
And don't say goodbye when you leave on a mission.

470
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,720
It's just too sad.

471
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,320
Why do you cry like that?

472
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,900
I'm very sorry.

473
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,560
I don't know what I should feel or do at a time like this.

474
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,420
Why don't you just try smiling?

475
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,100
Ayanami, with no rifle.

476
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,360
I will go.

477
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,480
If I die, I can be replaced.

478
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:26,880
An

479
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,700
end to mine!

480
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:27,980
Ray!

481
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,920
AT field full power.

482
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,160
A dream?

483
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,120
Yeah, don't tell me you don't dream, either.

484
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,060
We must finish this before Sele has time to act.

485
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,000
After all, it's not acceptable to lose Unit 2 at this time.

486
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,660
But you can't just use the Lance of Longinus without getting Sele's approval first.

487
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,000
You can rest today. We'll take care of everything.

488
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,800
But, um, I'm feeling just fine now.

489
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,740
Well, that's good for you.

490
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,580
Ray! Invasive action!

491
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,760
Ray Ayanami, age 14.

492
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,700
The first of the test subjects chosen in accordance with the Marduk Report.

493
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,180
The first child.

494
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,640
Designated pilot for the Evangelion Unit Zero.

495
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,620
Her past has been eradicated.

496
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,160
while her personal records have been erased.

497
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,240
Target invasion of Unit Zero continuing!

498
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,200
Unit Two, take the heat off of

499
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,440
Rey!

500
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,400
Haver Unit Two, lift off!

501
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,060
What are you doing?

502
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,640
Asuka, move out now!

503
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,680
What's wrong?

504
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,040
The pilot sink ratio is under 10%!

505
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,180
Asuka!

506
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,600
It just won't move.

507
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,940
I will go in Unit Two.

508
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,380
This is pain.

509
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:00,980
Pain?

510
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,200
No, it's different.

511
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,040
Loneliness.

512
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,200
Yes.

513
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,580
This is loneliness.

514
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,060
Am I the one crying?

515
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:14,880
Ray!

516
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,600
I want Evangelion Unit 1 taken out of cryostasis.

517
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,680
Launch it immediately.

518
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:20,720
What?

519
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,820
Do it.

520
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,500
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,620
Why for her?

522
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,940
Am I so worthless you couldn't do

523
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,500
this for me?

524
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
Spread your AT field to full! Get Bri out of there now!

525
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,420
Roger.

526
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,160
It smells like Ikari.

527
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,240
Ikari!

528
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,000
Is this my mind and soul? To unite as one with Ikari?

529
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,960
You will not.

530
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,800
Her AT field's been reversed!

531
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,920
I must stay. If I leave Unit Zero, the AT field will cease to be. I will not

532
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,459
let it...

533
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,020
Rey! Don't do it!

534
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,500
The same weather day after day.

535
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,020
Somehow the disappearance of autumn makes this country seem more melancholy.

536
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,620
If the scenario described in Sele's secret Dead Sea Scrolls is correct,

537
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,900
then the third impact will occur in a little over ten years from now.

538
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,120
That's why they created Sele and Gehern, to keep that from happening.

539
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
Your intentions are noble.

540
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,080
I wish I could say the same for Sele.

541
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,300
Professor Fyutski, opening the seal in this world would be catastrophic.

542
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,340
Ikari is in charge of the project now,

543
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,580
but it takes more than one person to accomplish something like that.

544
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,260
What happened last time must never be repeated.

545
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,800
I've been sent a warning.

546
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,660
Apparently those bastards would have no qualms about making me disappear.

547
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,040
You or any

548
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,960
of the other survivors.

549
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,120
It's so easy to erase someone.

550
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,460
All the more reason for you not to become the next test subject.

551
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,720
Everything has its place in the flow of life.

552
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,240
That's why I'm a member of Seilei.

553
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,200
For Shinji's sake.

554
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,340
It's been three years since we were last here.

555
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,100
That's when I ran away.

556
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,760
I haven't come back here since then.

557
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,920
I just don't believe that my mom is really resting here.

558
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,320
I don't even remember her face.

559
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
Burying memories is a man's way of surviving.

560
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,440
But there are some things a man should never forget.

561
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,560
Yui taught me that one irreplaceable thing, Shinji.

562
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,920
That is the reason I come here to confirm that commitment.

563
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,460
You don't have a picture of her.

564
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,880
No photographs.

565
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,980
Even this grave is an artifice.

566
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,160
Nothing remains.

567
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,200
That's just like my teacher said.

568
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,520
You cast everything away.

569
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,760
Everything is kept in my heart.

570
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,480
And I'm fine with that.

571
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,560
You've always been so cool and analytical about these things.

572
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,540
Aren't you afraid you're going to lose your chance at happiness?

573
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,520
First, I have to find a

574
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,860
definition of happiness.

575
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,800
Gosh, it's been a while since I went out.

576
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,540
Well, have a good one.

577
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,920
Did you need me for something, Ray?

578
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,840
I lost my way, Doctor.

579
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,880
Oh, is that so?

580
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,100
Well, you want to come with me then?

581
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,560
No thanks.

582
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,660
Well, how will you get home all by yourself?

583
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,560
Mind

584
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,320
your business, old hag.

585
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,040
Old

586
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,380
hag?

587
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,280
I can find my way home by myself, old hag.

588
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,780
You shouldn't call someone an old hag, Rey.

589
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,540
But you are an old hag, aren't you?

590
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm getting mad.

591
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,500
Commander Akari will spank you for this, you

592
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:15,920
little--

593
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,720
The commander is the one who calls you that.

594
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,900
He says that old hack is annoying, that old hack is no use anymore.

595
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,640
You little bitch!

596
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,420
It's reactivated!

597
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,100
Oh my god!

598
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,680
This is impossible! It must be wrong!

599
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,020
How can Shinji's sync ratio with Unit 1 be over 400%?

600
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,060
It's finally happened. It's aware.

601
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,080
I'm here.

602
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,600
It's eating the angel.

603
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,600
The S2 engine. She's taking it into herself.

604
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,820
*cough*

605
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,700
It's breaking free!

606
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,920
Free of what?

607
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,260
Those plates weren't just armor, they were also restraints.

608
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,760
Those bindings allowed us to control it, but now, the Eva is removing the web that binds it to our will.

609
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,080
The beast inside the Eva is free at last!

610
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,600
Unit 1's been awakened and set free.

611
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,820
Sele sure won't stay quiet for this.

612
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,980
Was this part of your scenario, Commander Ikari?

613
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,320
It has begun.

614
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,460
Indeed, this is the beginning.

615
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,820
I'm still alive.

616
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,040
Ainami!

617
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,540
I'm so glad.

618
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,400
I can't believe you're alive.

619
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,840
Why isn't my father here?

620
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,080
Anyway, thank you for saving my life.

621
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,560
For doing what?

622
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,580
You saved me.

623
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,500
by sacrificing Unit Zero.

624
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh.

625
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,100
Did I save you?

626
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,700
Don't you remember?

627
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,160
I don't

628
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,500
know.

629
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,700
I think I'm probably the

630
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,420
third one.

631
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,460
Oh my god!

632
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,020
It's Ray!

633
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:07,940
They're all Ray!

634
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,860
You mean the dummy plugs are--

635
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,400
Uh-huh.

636
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,580
These make up the cores of the dummy plugs.

637
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,340
They're what makes the system work.

638
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,740
What are they?

639
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,520
These?

640
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,320
These are empty vessels, nothing but spare parts, spare rays.

641
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,960
Mankind found a god, and man in his folly tried to make the god his toy.

642
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,880
For that arrogance, mankind was punished.

643
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,020
That happened 15 years ago, and the god that man found was lost.

644
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,300
But man continues to attempt to resurrect the god,

645
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,620
And from that god, Adam, man, attempted to make a man who was like a god himself.

646
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,920
And that was Eva.

647
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,960
What? Evas are human?

648
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,480
Yes. Inside the empty shell of each Eva is a human soul.

649
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,100
But the only vessel which can hold a soul is Ray.

650
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,480
These things are empty husks.

651
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,300
They have no souls, no right to live.

652
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,940
The room of Goth is empty.

653
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,780
Stop this! Do you have any idea what you're doing?

654
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:28,140
Yes, I do. I'm destroying them. These aren't human. Just things with human forms.

655
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,460
You're late!

656
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Sorry, sorry.

657
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,080
Shall we begin?

658
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:56,680
Sure.

659
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,000
*Sigh*

660
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,540
Reclassify Unit 3 as the 13th Angel.

661
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,200
But the pilot is...

662
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,040
It can't

663
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,120
be.

664
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,420
Is that the angel?

665
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,720
Correct. That is your target.

666
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,420
Shinji, why aren't you fighting?

667
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:58,740
I

668
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,200
can't!

669
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,740
There's still a person inside that thing!

670
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,140
Irrelevant. It's an angel. Destroy our enemy.

671
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:05,780
I can't!

672
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,880
If he's still alive, we've got to try and help him!

673
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,880
I just can't kill another human being!

674
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,160
It's him or you!

675
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,640
No! I'd rather be dead!

676
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,420
God! Shut down all of the synchronization circuits in Unit 1 immediately!

677
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,820
Shut them down?

678
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,220
Correct. Switch all control to the dummy plug system.

679
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:24,620
But

680
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,920
sir, the dummy plug isn't fully operational yet. Dr. Akagi hasn't approved its use!

681
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,500
It's still better than the current pilot! Do it!

682
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:33,740
Ugh...

683
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,540
What's going on? What the hell are you doing, father?!

684
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,600
Toji was real sorry about everything.

685
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,440
His kid's sister really tore him a new one.

686
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,220
She said it was the robot that saved our lives.

687
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:37,560
No!

688
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,340
*crying*

689
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,760
Please! Please just stop it!

690
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,220
Make it stop!

691
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,100
Dear God, make it stop!

692
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,020
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

693
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,820
Father, no!

694
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,960
What shall I cook?

695
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,380
I sure hope he's hungry tomorrow.

696
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,000
Shinji...

697
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,420
I'm... sorry.

698
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,620
The pilot of Unit 3 is...

699
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,420
The fourth child is...

700
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,300
Toji.

701
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,600
Shinji.

702
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:27,680
Shinji!

703
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,760
Can you tell me what my father's like?

704
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,760
Well, there's a surprise question.

705
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,120
I would have thought you'd ask about Katsuragi.

706
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,180
It seems like you're always with my father.

707
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,840
Commander Fiyutsuki is the one who's always with him.

708
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,380
Have you been asking around about your father?

709
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,000
I just haven't been around him much.

710
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,600
So you really don't know him?

711
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,360
But I've learned a lot about him lately.

712
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,900
I've learned how he feels about his work, about my mother.

713
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,940
No, you're wrong, Shinji.

714
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,020
You only believe that you've learned,

715
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,720
but people can't even really understand themselves, much less each other.

716
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,180
Understanding 100% of anything is impossible.

717
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,540
That's why we spend so much time trying to understand our own motivations and those of others.

718
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:14,800
That's

719
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,320
what makes life so... interesting.

720
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
So you can't understand Misato either.

721
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,040
The kanji that we use for the word she means a woman far away.

722
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,080
And women will always seem to be on a distant shore.

723
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,960
A gulf that separates male and female is deeper than any ocean.

724
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,400
What were you doing in Kyoto?

725
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,280
I wasn't in Kyoto.

726
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,120
Don't try to fool me.

727
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,520
You'll get your fingers burned if you get too involved in this.

728
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,500
That's the advice of a friend.

729
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,300
I'd rather be burned by the heat of my passion for you.

730
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,840
Should I buy you some fireworks, then?

731
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:51,640
Hello!

732
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:52,600
You never

733
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,680
change, do you?

734
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,640
Of course I change.

735
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,220
The simple act of living is to embrace change.

736
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,400
Homeostasis and

737
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,120
transistasis.

738
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,720
Homeo

739
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:01,920
-what?

740
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,040
The

741
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,340
force to maintain the present status and the force for constant change.

742
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,200
All living creatures are an organic battleground for the two conflicting forces.

743
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,760
Like men and women.

744
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,060
Katsuragi, it's me.

745
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,700
I'm sure you're listening to this message, especially after I caused so much trouble.

746
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:21,360
Sorry.

747
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,920
Please tell Ritsu I'm sorry, too.

748
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,900
And there's one more thing to trouble you with.

749
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,140
I've been growing... flowers.

750
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,360
I'd appreciate it if you could water them for me.

751
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,200
Shinji knows where they are.

752
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,160
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.

753
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:40,780
Don't hesitate.

754
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,020
Move ahead.

755
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,620
And if I can see you again, I will say the words I could not say eight years ago.

756
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:50,200
Bye.

757
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,680
You fool.

758
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,860
You were always such a fool.

759
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,600
Hi.

760
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,440
You're a little late, aren't you?

761
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,820
Stop saying such moronic things, you irresponsible jerk!

762
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,620
Why won't you listen to me?

763
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,920
Kaji is dead!

764
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,660
Liar.

765
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,000
The song is good.

766
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,480
Singing brings joy and revitalizes the human soul.

767
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,940
I think that song is the highest achievement of the Lillin culture.

768
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,100
Don't you agree, Shinji Ikari?

769
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,420
How do you know my name?

770
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,080
Everyone knows your name.

771
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,000
I don't mean to sound rude, but you're rather ignorant of your own position.

772
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:22,720
Really?

773
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,300
Who are

774
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:24,540
you?

775
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,160
I am Kwaru.

776
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,380
Kwaru Nagisa.

777
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,180
I am like you.

778
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,060
I am one of the selected children.

779
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,560
The fifth child.

780
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,020
You're the fifth child?

781
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,540
Um, Mr. Nagisa...

782
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,380
Call me Kwaru, Mr. Ikari.

783
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,260
Mr. Ikari?

784
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,080
Oh, no.

785
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,320
You can call me Shinji.

786
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,180
It is time. Let us go, Adam's dark shadow, servant of the Lillan.

787
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,100
Ava Unit 2 is

788
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,360
active!

789
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,520
That's impossible. Where's Asuka?

790
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,100
She's in

791
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,360
room 303! I've confirmed it!

792
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,680
Who the hell's inside there?

793
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,560
It's unmanned! The entry plug hasn't even been inserted into Unit 2!

794
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,120
Unmanned? So the fifth child isn't there?

795
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,340
AT field detected in Central Dogma!

796
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,200
EVA 2?

797
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,260
No! The pattern is blue! It's not one of ours!

798
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:18,780
It's an

799
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,020
angel!

800
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,840
That means that Ritzko is...

801
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,300
The target has passed Defensive Layer 4, and is still descending!

802
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,820
It's no good! We can't cut the power

803
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,160
to the linear motor car!

804
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,820
Evacuate

805
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,800
the area! Seal all shutters and bulkheads surrounding Central Dogma!

806
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,820
We must buy ourselves more time!

807
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh dear God in heaven, Sele has delivered an angel to us.

808
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:50,420
The old man wants to advance his schedule using us as his tools.

809
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,920
Those

810
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,900
who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.

811
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,000
Unless man accepts and atones for his sins, he will never evolve.

812
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,140
The powers possessed

813
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,540
by Adam and the angels were never meant to be abused this way.

814
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,300
We must take the fate of the future into our own hands.

815
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,360
Unit 1 will be our instrument.

816
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,740
Unit 2 has broken through the armored shutters.

817
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,080
The target has been ensured at the second barrier, sir!

818
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,320
Send Unit 1 in to pursue it.

819
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:17,820
Right!

820
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,440
Under all circumstances, the last Angel must be kept from entering Terminal Dogma.

821
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,620
But why did the Angel take Unit 2?

822
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,420
You don't think it's going to attempt to fuse with Unit 2, do you?

823
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,640
Or will it bring about our total destruction?

824
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,080
No, no, no! It's not possible! I won't believe that Kauru's an angel! It's a lie!

825
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,040
It's a fact, Shinji. You must accept it. Prepare for combat, do you understand?

826
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,660
Shinji, you are late.

827
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,760
Evil Unit 1 descending via Route 2. It's about to make contact with the target.

828
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,160
You betrayed me. You betrayed the trust that I placed in you! You betrayed me just like my father did!

829
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,960
Unit 1 has

830
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,800
reached the fourth layer. It's about to confront the target.

831
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,800
That's him!

832
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,240
I have been waiting for you, Shinji.

833
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,080
Kauru!

834
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,720
Asuka, I'm sorry!

835
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,360
The Eva series was born for man's antithesis, and yet the Lilin will utilize that which they

836
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,100
hate most of all in order to survive?

837
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,780
I do not understand.

838
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:30,740
Kauru!

839
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,280
Stop!

840
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,700
Why is this happening?

841
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,080
Your

842
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,460
Evas and I are composed of the very same matter.

843
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,440
Born from Adam, I can synchronize with it easily as long as there is no dominant soul.

844
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,980
And Unit 2's soul is now hiding itself.

845
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,580
Thus, Eva Unit 2 is mine.

846
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,560
You've got your own AT field?

847
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,620
Yes, at least that is what you, Lillian, call this thing.

848
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,540
This is the light of my soul, a sacred territory in which no one may intrude.

849
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,260
Aren't you, Lillian, aware that your so-called AT field is merely that wall that encloses your mind?

850
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,480
I don't understand what you're talking about!

851
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,640
*Grunts*

852
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,940
Both Avas have penetrated the final layer!

853
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,360
If Unit 1's signal cuts off or disappears, or if any other change should occur for the worst...

854
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:21,760
I've got it covered, Major. I'm ready to destroy this entire compound. It's better than letting Third Impact take place.

855
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,380
I'm sorry.

856
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,060
It's alright. Dying beside you wouldn't be a bad way to go out.

857
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,760
Thank you.

858
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,820
This is mankind's fate. The thread of human hope is spun with the flax of sorrow.

859
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:41,940
What the hell is that?

860
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,680
It's another AT field! The strongest we've ever detected!

861
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,400
It's shutting out everything! Light, magnetism, subatomic particles!

862
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,240
It's blocking everything out?

863
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,060
It can't sense anything! The target, Unit 1, Unit 2, they're all gone!

864
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,920
We lost communication with the pilot!

865
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,120
Karu, no!

866
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,820
Karu!

867
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:25,940
Karu!

868
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,320
Terminal safety has been penetrated.

869
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,540
They've reached it. Heaven's door is open.

870
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,760
Then the Angel has finally reached its goal.

871
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,780
Get ready.

872
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,480
*Screams*

873
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,960
What's that? What's going on?

874
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,360
It's

875
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,500
another AT field! A field as strong as the first one has appeared around Terminal Dogma.

876
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,060
I don't believe it! It's breaking through the other AT field!

877
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,700
What is it? Another Angel?

878
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,900
I don't know! I can't confirm it! My God! It totally disappeared!

879
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,060
Disappeared? The angel?

880
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,100
Adam, that from which we came.

881
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,880
Must one who was born from Adam return to Adam, even though it will destroy man?

882
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,820
Wait, but this is not... Lilith.

883
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,900
I see. I understand now. The Lilin. Lilith.

884
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,000
I thank you, Shinji. I wanted you to take Unit 2 from me.

885
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,760
Otherwise, with her protection, I would have been able to survive much longer.

886
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,760
Karu, but why?

887
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,100
It

888
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,320
is my destiny to live forever, though it will destroy the Lilin.

889
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,060
However, it is possible for me to be killed, and whether I live or die makes no great difference.

890
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:56,900
The one truth the Lillian have never been able to grasp is that death may be the only absolute freedom there ever was.

891
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:57,860
What are you?

892
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,040
Karu, I don't

893
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,220
understand what you're talking about.

894
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,700
Please, don't make me do this.

895
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,560
This is my wish.

896
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,300
I want you to destroy me.

897
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,400
Otherwise, you will be destroyed.

898
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,420
Only one life form can be chosen to evade the destruction and seize the future.

899
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,900
and you are not the existence which should die.

900
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,160
You need the future.

901
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,620
It is what you live for.

902
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,000
I thank you, Shinji Ikari.

903
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:33,520
My life was meaningful because of you.

904
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,600
Misato and Ayanami scare me.

905
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,040
Help me.

906
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,320
Help me, Asuka.

907
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:28,560
Hey.

908
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,700
Quit fooling around.

909
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,800
Come on.

910
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,800
Asuka, wake up.

911
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,060
This isn't funny anymore.

912
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,560
Asuka, wake up!

913
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:39,920
Asuka!

914
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,360
Asuka!

915
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:41,480
Asuka!

916
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:49,620
Help me.

917
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,820
Asuka, please help me.

918
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,240
I need you.

919
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,460
Please, Asuka, help me.

920
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,420
Call me an idiot like you always do.

921
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,480
Just say something, damn it.

922
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,440
Please, wake up!

923
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,140
I'm so fucked up.

924
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,880
All access to and from headquarters has been restricted.

925
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,060
We're on

926
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:01,740
first level alert.

927
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,920
That doesn't make sense. I thought Kwaru was the last angel.

928
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,420
He was. All the angels have been defeated.

929
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,200
So if we're all safe, then what are we doing on first level alert?

930
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,040
What's going to happen to Nerve and the Evas?

931
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,340
I wish Dr. Akagi was here.

932
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:16,660
Well,

933
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,060
I think Nerve is probably just going to be disbanded.

934
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,140
And I don't even want to think about what they're planning to do with us.

935
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,240
All we can do is wait and see.

936
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:37,640
So mankind, a race of flawed and incomplete separate entities, has reached the end of its evolutionary potential.

937
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:43,940
The Instrumentality Project will manufacture the evolution of man's separate entities into a single consummate being.

938
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,760
And the Committee won't use Nerve or Atom.

939
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:48,360
They'll use the Evas.

940
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,860
Just like Kaji said they would.

941
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,860
The time is at hand.

942
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:58,820
Without the Lance of Longinus, we cannot use Lilith to complete the project.

943
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:04,240
Our only hope is to proceed using Lilith's only true offspring, Eva Unit One.

944
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,820
That was not part of Sele's original plan.

945
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,500
Creating the Evangelion was the pinnacle of mankind's existence.

946
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:14,060
Humanity must evolve and shape this brave new world.

947
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,560
That was why we created the Eva series.

948
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,140
We need not cast aside our human form to use Evangelion as our own private arc.

949
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:25,480
It's merely part of the process to free us all for rebirth.

950
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,760
The fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth.

951
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:35,980
Through the sacrament of death, God, humanity, and all living beings will be united and reborn as one.

952
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,340
Death creates nothing.

953
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,840
Your death will create an opportunity.

954
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,140
Mankind exists because it has the will to live.

955
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:51,680
After all, that's why she chose to remain in the Ava.

956
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,900
So... that's what really happened during the second impact.

957
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,760
They're on to me.

958
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:06,280
No wait. Something else.

959
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:09,760
Showtime.

960
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,680
Transfer the left circuits to the emergency communication systems. Use satellite feed if you have to.

961
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,580
Correct. What's the right side status?

962
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,280
Negative. All outgoing network lines are being systematically cut off.

963
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,720
They're going after the Magi.

964
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,260
Data upload from external

965
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:32,020
terminals. Sir, it looks like they're trying to hack into the Magi.

966
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:35,780
Just as I thought. Is the uplink coming from the Magi 2 and Matsushiro?

967
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:40,700
No. There are five Magi systems working together. I've identified Germany, China, and the US.

968
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:47,400
So Sele is pooling all its resources. Five Magi working against one. Not good odds.

969
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,640
The fourth firewall has been

970
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,080
breached!

971
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:54,160
Locking the main database! Negative! The system is being overtaken!

972
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,820
They've breached the next level! The backup system didn't even slow them down!

973
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,540
This is bad.

974
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:03,460
If they capture the Magi, it's all over for us.

975
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,320
Let me guess. They need help with the Magi's self-defense system.

976
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:21,940
That's right. Report to the Second Command Center, where you will be briefed by Lieutenant Ibuki.

977
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,260
He

978
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:27,400
expects the woman he abandoned to jump when he calls. Arrogant bastard.

979
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,160
Talk to me, Hyuga.

980
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,740
Tokyo-2 is launched. Special Order A-801.

981
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,480
What's that supposed to mean?

982
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:43,220
Nerves, legal protection, and jurisdiction have been revoked. Command has been transferred to the Japanese government.

983
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,700
They only gave us one warning.

984
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:52,020
It's a mess up here. They tried to take over the Magi, but we've been able to minimize most of the damage so far.

985
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,760
Ibuki here. Dr. Akagi is currently installing additional defense programs.

986
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,020
Huh?

987
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:01,300
Ritsuko?

988
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,340
Am I doing something stupid?

989
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:19,300
The interaction between men and women is so illogical.

990
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,620
Isn't that right?

991
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:23,600
Mother.

992
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:29,880
How much longer?

993
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:30,980
We should make it.

994
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,540
Dr. Akagi is amazing.

995
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,180
One more minute and she'll

996
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,040
be at page 020

997
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,040
in the manual.

998
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,780
Just hacking into the Magi?

999
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:36,840
Yeah, right.

1000
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,460
Doubt they're going to let us off that easily.

1001
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:42,120
The Magi was just foreplay.

1002
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:47,900
Sele is planning to launch an all-out offensive against headquarters and take the two Evas by force, aren't they?

1003
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,780
Of course. We have both Adam and Lilith.

1004
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,220
No wonder the old bastards are so nervous.

1005
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:01,880
External feed to the Magi has been halted. A Da Nang B-type defense program is in place.

1006
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:05,040
External access has been cut off for the next 62 hours.

1007
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,820
Well, Mother, I'll see you soon.

1008
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,420
Ikari has installed a Type 666 firewall on the Magi's external feed circuits.

1009
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,240
That's very difficult to breach.

1010
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:26,840
Apparently we will have to forgo acquisition of the Tokyo Three Magi.

1011
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,700
I had hoped to settle this peacefully, but he leaves me no choice.

1012
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,800
Launch the invasion forces immediately.

1013
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:44,840
Showtime, ladies.

1014
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,320
All units move out.

1015
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:16,400
We've lost the

1016
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,300
The radar feed from sectors 8 through 17.

1017
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:23,320
A large detachment of special force units has invaded the outer defense perimeter.

1018
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,300
Two more units are in the Gotemba sector.

1019
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:25,740
After

1020
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:29,320
all we've been through, our final enemy is our fellow man.

1021
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:29,780
All

1022
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,320
personnel go to level one battle stations.

1023
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,160
Battle stations?

1024
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:36,240
This isn't an angel attack.

1025
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,000
We can't kill humans.

1026
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,400
I wish those bastards felt the same way.

1027
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,920
Huh? What's happening? Hey!

1028
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,000
What's wrong?

1029
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,140
Transmission from the southern hub has been interrupted.

1030
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:09,980
Uh...

1031
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,940
Southern Hub Station has gone silent.

1032
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:30,220
The West Side attack is just a decoy.

1033
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,300
If they're really after the Evas, they'll go after the pilots first.

1034
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:35,760
Tell Shinji to stand by in Unit 1, got it?

1035
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:36,340
Roger.

1036
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:36,940
Where's

1037
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:37,320
Asuka?

1038
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,500
She's still in recovery.

1039
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,600
Get her suited up and get her in Unit 2!

1040
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,580
Asuka's barely conscious. There's no way she'll be able to synchronize.

1041
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:50,080
If they find her, they're going to kill her. If we put her in Unit 2, at least she'll be safe.

1042
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,840
Understood, ma'am. Cease Pilot's medical treatment and prepare her for launch.

1043
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,300
As soon as Asuka's in there, stow

1044
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,660
Unit 2 at the bottom of the lake.

1045
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,200
It's not the best hiding place, but it's better than the cage. Where's Rey?

1046
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,760
Unable to locate. Pilot of Unit 0 is missing.

1047
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,040
They will kill her. Find her now.

1048
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,920
Launching Unit 2 via Gate Number 8. The airway will remain at a depth of 70 meters.

1049
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:30,980
Get ready to deploy Unit 1! Station it in the geo-front!

1050
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,160
We can't! Shinji isn't there!

1051
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,080
Oh dear god.

1052
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,540
The number three underground barricade has been destroyed.

1053
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,140
Enemy forces have begun evading level two.

1054
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:54,480
There's nothing

1055
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,060
more that we can do to hold them off.

1056
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:58,240
Our defeat has become inevitable.

1057
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,760
Professor Friutski, take care of this please.

1058
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,200
Yes, Commander. Please give my regards to Yui.

1059
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,200
Internal monorail track

1060
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,600
57 has been destroyed!

1061
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:38,460
This is brutal.

1062
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,940
I'd rather be fighting the angels.

1063
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:43,940
Of course we don't normally fight human enemies.

1064
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,100
Sever those cables!

1065
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,180
Start with the red ones!

1066
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,160
- Hit 'em again.

1067
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,340
-

1068
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:04,540
- Level

1069
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,440
3 block B has been invaded! - There's

1070
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,460
no stopping them! - Enemy presence

1071
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,480
confirmed in block F. The main bypass

1072
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,380
is under fire!

1073
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:12,400
- Seal off

1074
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,560
levels 1 through 3. Order a full

1075
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,520
retreat. Release Bakelite

1076
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,720
infusion in all passages through section 803. - Right!

1077
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,840
Well, that should buy us some time.

1078
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,260
Major Katsuragi, Route 47 is completely blocked.

1079
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,160
The third unit can't move forward.

1080
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:36,600
Shinji is totally cut off.

1081
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,240
All non-combat personnel should avoid engaging the enemy.

1082
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,360
These guys are pros, so if you can't retreat to Central Dogma, you're better off just surrendering.

1083
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:55,140
Take care of things here for me.

1084
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:55,960
Right.

1085
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,040
This is harder

1086
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:00,640
than we thought.

1087
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,700
We never get the easy jobs.

1088
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:06,840
This is insane.

1089
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:10,020
The center was made to withstand angel attacks, not invading armies.

1090
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,260
Safety off.

1091
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,380
Yeah, we could barely hold off terrorists.

1092
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,080
If the

1093
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,480
JSSDF decides to mount an all-out invasion, we're totally screwed.

1094
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,040
Slowly

1095
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,160
but surely they've been cutting our defense budget.

1096
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,420
I wouldn't be surprised if they've been planning this from the very beginning.

1097
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,300
I wouldn't be surprised either.

1098
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:26,580
*Gasp

1099
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:26,580
*

1100
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:32,220
*Gasp

1101
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:32,220
*

1102
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:34,380
*Gasp*

1103
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,060
*Gasp*

1104
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,660
Release the safety.

1105
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:39,840
*Gasp*

1106
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,060
I can't! I just can't shoot this thing, Aoba!

1107
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,440
Of course you can! You've had basic training!

1108
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,040
But

1109
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,080
I shot at targets, not at other human beings!

1110
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,180
Idiot! You kill or you die!

1111
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:08,400
Rey.

1112
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,400
I knew I'd find you here.

1113
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,380
The time has come. Let's go.

1114
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,360
Level 1 has been secured.

1115
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:30,740
Over.

1116
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,500
Roger that.

1117
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:34,300
We are moving in on the Magi in the Level 2 Command Center.

1118
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,420
We are currently engaged in combat.

1119
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,160
Please, Jesus, please, please, Jesus.

1120
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:42,620
Command the

1121
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,240
cooling of the Pitma Bulge sector immediately.

1122
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:52,440
Terminate EVA pilots on site. Execution of non-combat personnel has been authorized.

1123
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,760
Yanagihara and Shinjo units, proceed to lower level.

1124
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:00,240
We've located the third child,

1125
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:01,940
commencing termination.

1126
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,340
Sorry kid, nothing personal.

1127
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,060
Hey, no offense taken.

1128
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,720
Let's get you to Unit 1. Come on.

1129
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,920
What's the status of Detachment 7? Have you reached the cage?

1130
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:30,260
Over?

1131
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,220
Roger that! We have the purple unit surrounded. The Bakelight infusion was not a problem.

1132
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,720
The red unit has been launched. We're attempting to

1133
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,060
establish which launch route was used. Over.

1134
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,020
Damn. They're trying to prevent contacts between Shinji and Unit 1.

1135
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:45,100
We're running out of time.

1136
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:51,440
This is it, Shinji. Do you want to run away, or do you want to pilot the Eva?

1137
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:53,580
It's your call.

1138
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,340
If you sit there and do nothing, then you're already dead.

1139
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:02,100
Help me, Asuka. Help me.

1140
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,880
Hiding behind the skirts of a little girl at a time like this?

1141
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,460
Snap out of it!

1142
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:09,680
Giving up halfway is worse than never trying at all.

1143
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:10,520
Come on!

1144
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,300
Get up!

1145
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,220
Move it!

1146
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,520
I... I want to die.

1147
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,760
Just leave me here.

1148
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,960
Stop talking like a stubborn little brat!

1149
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,840
Like it or not, you're still alive.

1150
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,620
Get moving and do something.

1151
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:25,980
You can die later.

1152
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:30,140
Unimportant.

1153
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,900
Securing Terminal Dogma is your number one priority.

1154
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:33,380
Understand?

1155
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,820
They've destroyed just about everything else.

1156
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,940
Why don't they just nuke us and get it over with already?

1157
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,740
Hey, if we weren't sitting on top of the original Magi system,

1158
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:46,780
they probably would have blown us to bits by now.

1159
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,580
I guess that would explain why they haven't used any explosives yet.

1160
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,260
I just hope they don't start using BC weapons.

1161
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,000
Things could get pretty ugly.

1162
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,440
That or in two minds.

1163
01:32:13,719 --> 01:32:14,920
*Clears*

1164
01:32:18,739 --> 01:32:20,620
Speak of the devil. Damn

1165
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,900
haven't you ever heard of moderation?

1166
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,760
That was a little much

1167
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,960
Why can't they possibly want Eva this badly?

1168
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:38,120
They plan to initiate third impact using the Eva series instead of the Angels.

1169
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,520
Fifteen years ago, second impact was intentionally engineered by mankind,

1170
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,900
because it was the only way to minimize the potential damage.

1171
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,980
They had to reduce Adam to an embryonic state before the other Angels awoke.

1172
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:59,000
You see, Shinji, mankind was spawned from a being called Lilith, just like Adam was.

1173
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,500
We are the 18th angel.

1174
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,860
The other angels are just different possibilities, what we could have become.

1175
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,520
They're humans who rejected our human form.

1176
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:17,320
Sadly, we cannot coexist together, even though we are fundamentally the same creatures.

1177
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,420
Listen, Shinji, you're going to have to destroy the rest of the Eva series.

1178
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,060
It's the only way to stay alive.

1179
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:28,320
The phone lines are all dead.

1180
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:30,160
Yes, sir. Missile impact

1181
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,580
was confirmed three minutes ago.

1182
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,100
This instrumentality project Nerve was secretly researching,

1183
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:38,100
trying to initiate third impact and destroy all of mankind.

1184
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,040
The whole thing makes me sick.

1185
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,320
Humanity is probably the only creature capable of hating its own kind.

1186
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:50,060
Well then, I suppose all we have left to do is to destroy Nerve headquarters.

1187
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,860
Should Germany or China begin redevelopment?

1188
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,260
No.

1189
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,480
We won't make the same mistake twice.

1190
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,500
Make sure no one can touch it for the next 20 years. Like old Tokyo.

1191
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:08,860
Surface heat has dissipated. High-pressure steam discharges have also stopped.

1192
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,460
All detachments positions have been confirmed.

1193
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,720
Dogma Level 3 and the purple unit are currently secured.

1194
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,300
What about the red one?

1195
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,580
It's in the lake about 70 meters down, Commander.

1196
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:24,340
We can't determine whether or not the pilot is alive or dead.

1197
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,660
I'm still alive.

1198
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:47,100
*cough*

1199
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,000
*Screaming*

1200
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,060
Don't wanna die x3

1201
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:42,180
Don't wanna die x3

1202
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:04,440
I don't wanna die I don't wanna die I don't wanna die I don't wanna die

1203
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,400
I DON'T WANNA DIE

1204
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,320
Mama, You've been here all along?

1205
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:22,500
Mama?

1206
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,500
What the hell is that?

1207
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,460
Dear God!

1208
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,980
Schwein hunt!

1209
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:05,380
Mama! Mama! Now I understand!

1210
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,740
The meaning of the AT field!

1211
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,160
You were always protecting me!

1212
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,140
Always watching over me!

1213
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:36,880
Always! We were always together, Mama!

1214
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:44,660
Epa Unit 2 has activated! Asuka is okay! She's alive!

1215
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:46,100
Asuka!

1216
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,780
The cable! Focus on the cable! Use whatever you can to sever it!

1217
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:57,860
Scheist.

1218
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:05,340
Even without my umbilical cable attached, I've still got 12,000 plates of fortified armor!

1219
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,760
And I've got my AT field!

1220
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,660
There's no way I can lose!

1221
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,620
Eat this, ah schnook!

1222
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:48,940
That loathsome Evangelion.

1223
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:55,000
Once again our plans will go unrealized. It seems we'll have to fight fire with fire.

1224
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,680
The Eva series has been completed.
