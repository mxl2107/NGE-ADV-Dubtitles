Speaker 1
The young man

Speaker 2
I'm

Speaker 1
just looking at you and smiling. I'm so happy to touch the one I want. I'm still in awe of my dreams. But I'm sure you'll notice that the back of my eyes. The future will be the way to the future The world is a terrible, the天使's the day The window from the end of the day The hot air is a hot air to the day The memories of the night The sky is shining

Speaker 3
Hey, cool! I just want a free ice cream bar!

Speaker 4
The cost of having my laundry done is killing me.

Speaker 5
Yeah, I know. I just wish I had the spare time to do my laundry for myself.

Speaker 6
Could

Speaker 7
be worse.

Speaker 6
At least we sleep at home.

Speaker 4
Oh, Commander Friutski. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.

Speaker 6
Good morning.

Speaker 4
Well, you're up early today, sir.

Speaker 6
I've got to represent Commander Ikari uptown.

Speaker 4
Ah, today's the city council meeting, isn't it?

Speaker 6
An exercise in ennui. Ikari always sticks me with the most boring and tedious assignments. I couldn't handle it without the Magi's help.

Speaker 4
Speaking of which, election day is coming up, isn't it?

Speaker 6
Yes, but the council really has no authority anyway. Actually, the Magi run just about everything.

Speaker 5
Really? You mean the same three supercomputers we use? Yes.

Speaker 6
Our government is run by the majority decision of three different computers. I suppose it's a sort of a form of democracy.

Speaker 5
And the council members just go along with their decisions? Well,

Speaker 6
it's been an effective form of government thus far.

Speaker 5
This city really is built on science. We're so lucky to be living in such a wonderful

Speaker 4
time.

Speaker 6
Eh, technophiles. You're running an experiment with Unit Zero this morning, aren't you?

Speaker 4
Yes. We're going to be performing the second prolonged EVA activation test at 10.30.

Speaker 6
Ah, I'll expect good news.

Speaker 4
Abort the test! Break the circuits! Cutting circuits.

Speaker 3
Power supply

Speaker 8
restored.

Speaker 4
It seems that one's the problem again.

Speaker 5
Yes. It looks like the conversion efficiency is 0.8% lower than our calculation.

Speaker 8
The conversion is barely within tolerance, though. What'll we do? Let's

Speaker 4
try it again using the same configuration, but lower the reciprocal conversion rate by 0.01. All right, let's start the experiment over again.

Speaker 7
Hey!

Speaker 9
Hold the elevator! Got it. Man, it's been a while since I ran that hard. So, what's with the black expression, Sunshine?

Speaker 10
It's nausea from having to see you. Yes,

Speaker 4
hold one minute, please.

Speaker 11
What? Uh,

Speaker 12
well, Father, uh, well...

Speaker 11
What is it? Hurry up.

Speaker 12
I'm supposed to tell my parents that an interview for advanced vocational education is going to be held at school.

Speaker 11
I've delegated all of that to Katsuragi. Don't bother me with such nonsense

Speaker 9
anymore. Don't forward any more of these calls to me.

Speaker 10
Huh?

Speaker 9
The power's out?

Speaker 10
No, it can't be. It's not possible.

Speaker 2
Something's wrong. An accident?

Speaker 9
Perhaps Dr. Akagi made a mistake, huh?

Speaker 5
The main power supply is shut down. Voltage level is zero. Uh, it's not our fault.

Speaker 9
Well, what do you think?

Speaker 5
The backup

Speaker 10
supply should switch back on any second now.

Speaker 6
No, sir. The backup circuits aren't working either. That can't be. Which circuits are still functioning?

Speaker 2
Only 1.2% of them! Only 9 circuits from number 2567!

Speaker 6
Connect all the remaining power circuits to maintain the Magi in Central Dogma. But that could interfere with our life support systems. Do it! We need the Magi!

Speaker 6
Nozomu Takahashi wants to help you form a more cheerful government... Man, that Captain Katsuragi sure is lazy.

Speaker 9
I mean, can't she at least make the time to go and pick up her own laundry? Huh?

Speaker 3
Maybe Commander Akari was just really busy. I don't think so. And it wasn't like he hung up. It sounded more like the line had failed. Hey, are you a man or what? Why do you let each and every little incident get under your skin? What are you doing? Here, let me... Hmm? Huh? Huh? Huh? Stupid thing! It must be broken, damn it! One, two,

Speaker 4
three! We'd better head for the command center. If the backup power hasn't kicked in yet... Then something's very wrong.

Speaker 9
What's the backup system?

Speaker 4
There are three backup circuits.

Speaker 10
It's impossible for all of these to fail at once.

Speaker 11
Then that means these circuit breakers didn't go on their own. Someone did this intentionally.

Speaker 6
Well, it would be a disaster if an Angel were to attack right now.

Speaker 8
Radar's detected an unidentified object. Projected landing point is in the form of atomic region. It must be Angel number eight. Yeah, an Angel. What'll we do? I guess the standard procedure is to go full alert status. It looks like this one's heading straight for Tokyo 3 and Nerve. Looks like it. Well, there's nothing we can do.

Speaker 4
It's still advancing.

Speaker 8
Any word yet from Tokyo 3? They're

Speaker 4
still not responding to our transmissions.

Speaker 8
What in the hell are those Nerve guys doing?

Speaker 4
I never thought I'd actually have to use one of these escape tubes. I figured they were just holdovers that we held onto just for

Speaker 2
our peace of mind. Well, being prepared is half the battle.

Speaker 3
This one doesn't work either.

Speaker 2
None of the facilities work.

Speaker 3
This is odd. Has something happened in the geo front?

Speaker 2
A natural assumption.

Speaker 3
Well, let's try to

Speaker 10
contact Nerve headquarters. The emergency phone isn't working either.

Speaker 11
There's no answer on line 77. None of them work.

Speaker 10
No,

Speaker 2
it's disconnected.

Speaker 10
This one, too. The

Speaker 3
main and emergency cables are all down.

Speaker 13
So what now?

Speaker 3
Oh.

Speaker 12
What are you looking for?

Speaker 3
What do you think, Doomkopf? I'm looking for my emergency manual. We should go to NERF headquarters ourselves. That's right, but before that, we're going to have to decide which of us will be this group's leader. Naturally, I have the best qualifications. Any objections? Well, let's go.

Speaker 2
Nervous over this way. We can use the access port for Route 7.

Speaker 12
But the doors don't work. Oh, we can open it manually.

Speaker 3
Well, there you go, Shinji. This is your department. You're the one who wants to be in charge,

Speaker 13
but whenever going gets tough, you always defer to me.

Speaker 8
That damn council always defers to us when the going gets tough. Well, what did they say? Those Tokyo-2 buttheads, they're getting ready to flee, of course.

Speaker 5
The angel is still advancing.

Speaker 8
In any case, we've got to try and make contact with Nerve. But how are we going to do that? We fly there ourselves.

This is the 3rd District JAS-DF. An unidentified object is moving toward this area.

Speaker 6
Oh boy, I gotta report this to headquarters, but how? Oh man! Hey,

Speaker 10
Booster Takahashi, he's the candidate who remains calm, even in situations like this.

Speaker 9
Ah, alright.

Speaker 10
I'm dying, it's too hot in here.

Speaker 9
The air conditioners are down too. If you're so hot, Katsuragi, why don't you take off your shirt? There's no reason for you to be shy, you know.

Speaker 10
Don't even think about trying to take advantage of this situation.

Speaker 9
Yeah, right.

Speaker 10
It's getting even warmer now that

Speaker 4
the air is getting stagnant. It's hard to believe that this base has the world's most advanced technology. Yeah, but look at the commanders.

Speaker 5
Even in this heat, they're both still cool and in command.

Speaker 6
It's hot. Yes. This geofront was designed to be a self-sufficient colony. It's supposed to be able to operate even when completely isolated from the outside. It's impossible for all the power sources to have broken down.

Speaker 4
Someone caused this?

Speaker 6
It would be a logical way to

Speaker 11
indirectly dissect this facility. You

Speaker 4
mean that they could figure out Nerve's layout by the restoration process?

Speaker 6
They are clever bastards. I

Speaker 4
could run a dummy program through the Magi. That would make it more difficult to get a complete grasp of our structure.

Speaker 6
Make it so.

Speaker 4
Yes, sir.

Speaker 6
I can't believe that the first havoc wrecked upon our headquarters was caused by another member of our own species.

Speaker 11
Mankind's greatest enemy is man himself.

Speaker 13
This usually only takes two minutes. Are you sure this is the right way? Of course I'm

Speaker 3
sure. We'll be at the Geo Front any minute now. Uh, haven't I heard that four times already? Jeez, why do you have to nitpick everything? You're always so negative. Me? What?

Speaker 2
Silence, please. Oh,

Speaker 3
what now, Wonder Girl?

Speaker 2
Listen. Attention

all nerve personnel. There's an angel approaching. Attention all nerve personnel.

Speaker 14
That's Yuga! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There's an angel approaching.

Speaker 3
An angel is approaching. A new angel?

Speaker 2
We can't waste any more time. There's a shortcut.

Speaker 3
Hey, don't forget that I'm the leader here. So where is this shortcut? This way may be quick, but we

Speaker 13
look really stupid. Hey, just what are the angels? Why are you asking now? I don't know. It just doesn't make sense. Angels are messengers from God, right? Why are we fighting angels? What are you,

Speaker 3
stupid? They attacked us. When someone's attacking you, you can't just sit there and do nothing, right? Let's see. To the right. I think the correct path is to the left. Stop contradicting me! Shinji, what do you think? Uh, uh... I'm not certain. Look, I'm the leader, so you can both just shut up and follow me.

Speaker 12
We're going up again. I thought something was odd here.

Speaker 3
So why didn't you say something earlier? You're always nitpicking, huh? This has got to be the Geo Front this time. -

Speaker 7
-

Speaker 7
- -

- - -

-

Speaker 3
- Well, we'd better hurry. Now that I've visually confirmed

Speaker 6
the angel's presence...

Speaker 6
- - - There's an angel approaching! We have to dispatch an Ava immediately! But how?

Speaker 11
Fyutski, take charge here. What? I'm going down to the cage to prepare the Evas for manual launch. Manually? Can that be done? We have a diesel generator for emergencies. Well, yes, but who is going to pilot them?

Speaker 3
This

Speaker 3
way. You're Commander Ikari's favorite, aren't you? I guess that that means you get treated a little different, right? Asuka, this isn't the time for this. You always look so smug, too. Hey, just because they like you best doesn't mean you can act so superior. I

Speaker 2
don't act superior. And I'm not treated any better either. I know that quite well.

Speaker 8
Understood. The termination plug has been ejected, sir. Excellent.

Speaker 11
Prepare for manual insertion of the entry plug. But the pilots aren't here yet.

Speaker 4
Don't worry. They'll be along soon enough. There's no way I can

Speaker 12
clear this away with my

Speaker 2
hands. Then we will have to break into another ventilation duct in order to get there.

Speaker 3
First child's feeling aggressive, and I'll bet she'd do anything to stay number one. Some people just think they're better than others.

Speaker 5
Entry plug is fixed and ready.

Speaker 4
Now all we need are the children.

Speaker 3
If you dare look up my dress, I'll kill you. Do you hear me, Shinji? You look! I'm there! I told

you not to look! What I'm done to the board is you!

Huh?

Speaker 4
Oh, that's where you've been. We've been waiting for you.

Speaker 11
Prepare for manual entry. Roger! Never open

Speaker 4
the hatches! The Evas? They're already on standby. Huh? But there's no power. It was all done by hand. The Commander did it. My father... Commander Akari believed in you and prepared everything.

Speaker 11
*Gunshot Understood. Remove all of the remaining restraints and supports. Commence launch!

Speaker 3
The Angel has stopped directly above us! Hurry up! Get a move on!

Speaker 4
The emergency batteries have been engaged! Well, we're ready. Let's move out!

Speaker 7
Oh!

Speaker 3
This is pathetic!

Speaker 2
Vertical shaft in sight. Get out of the way!

Speaker 3
I can't believe we're doing this, it's so embarrassing. Huh? Huh?

Speaker 2
It's acid, watch out! Huh? Oh!

Speaker 2
I'm not sure It would appear that the Angel plans to attack headquarters directly using that acid.

Speaker 3
What do we do? What do we do? We're gonna

Speaker 13
beat it, of course! Okay, but how? We dropped our rifles and the battery packs on our backs are running out of power! They will last more than another three minutes!

Speaker 3
I've got an idea. There will be three positions: defense, offense, and backup. Defense's job will be to neutralize that Angel's AT field and to protect the offense from the acid bath. Backup will go down the shaft, retrieve the rifles, and hand one to the offense, who will then fire a volley, destroying the target.

Speaker 2
How does that sound? I will take the defensive position.

Speaker 3
Sorry, Wonder Girl! That'll be my job. But it's too dangerous. That's why I'm doing it. And don't forget I still owe you one from the last time we fought an Angel. Shinji will be offense. Rei will be the backup. Got it? Understood. Right, here we go. Ava, let's go! Oscar! Hey, Nami! Oscar, get out of the way!

Speaker 3
Oscar! Now we're even, Shinji. Oh, no, please open,

Speaker 10
please. Why won't it open? Please, I've got to go to the bathroom now. Hey, you're not looking at my dress, are you? No,

Speaker 9
ma'am.

Speaker 7
Huh? Ah!

Speaker 5
Ah! Ah! Watch out! Ah!

Ah! Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

Speaker 5
Sex fiends.

Speaker 12
It's ironic. Without electricity and artificial light, the sky can look so beautiful at

Speaker 3
night. Yeah, but without the lights, it seems like there are no humans here. There. I feel much more comfortable this way.

Speaker 2
Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire. Hmph.

Speaker 12
Philosophy, huh? So is that what makes mankind a special species? Is that why the angels attack us?

Speaker 3
What are you, stupid? Who knows what they think?

Speaker 14
In other words, darling, kiss me Fill my heart with soul And let me sing forevermore You are all I want For all I want to adore In other words With this feature In other worlds

Speaker 10
I love you When Misada was promoted to Major, Shinji begins to learn about her personal vendetta against the Angels. Then it's up to the Eva team to stop the largest and most dangerous Angel yet! The size of this creature alone makes many abandon all hope, and that's before it unveils its

Speaker 7
terrifying new weapon!
