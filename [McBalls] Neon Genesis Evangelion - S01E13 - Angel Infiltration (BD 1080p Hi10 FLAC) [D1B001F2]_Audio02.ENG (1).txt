Speaker 1
The young

Speaker 2
man

Speaker 1
I just saw you, just looking and smiling. You are so close to touching the touch. I'm still in awe of your dreams. But I'm sure you'll notice that your back is still in the back. The future is the only way to the future The endless endless endless The window from the end of the world The hot-pastus is the only way to the world The memories of the world The sky will be shining Shonen, Yoshiwa-ni-nare!

Speaker 3
Hello? Are you done with the Magi's checkup yet? Almost finished. Didn't

Speaker 4
I promise you I'd be done before today's experiment? There's something else, Ritsko. Three impossible things to do and you still beat the schedule. That coffee's cold.

Speaker 5
All three Magi systems have entered self-diagnostic locally. One hundred

Speaker 6
twenty-five team maintenance

Speaker 3
has been completed. Confirmed. Well done, guys. Go ahead and take a break until the test begins. Everything checked out. As usual, Mother's in good shape, but... Is it just me getting older?

Speaker 7
What? Do you want me to take my clothes off again? The next chamber is an ultra-clean room environment. Just taking a shower and changing your undergarments is insufficient. Why do I have to go through all this for a dumb autopilot test?

Speaker 3
With the advance of time comes the need for AVA technology to advance as well. To do so, we need a constant influx of new data. Now get undressed. Yes, ma'am.

Speaker 7
Alright, I'm here just the way you wanted. Butt naked and run through the wash cycle 17 times.

Speaker 8
Very good. And I want all three of you to stay that way as you walk through the room and board the entry plug. What? Don't worry. The video recorders have been shut off. We do respect your privacy.

Speaker 9
Oh, sure you do, and that's not the point! This is a personal thing! The purpose of

Speaker 8
this experiment is

Speaker 7
to monitor

Speaker 8
the harmonics directly from your bodies, without the interference of your plugsuits. Aska, this is an order.

Speaker 7
Alright, but I don't want anybody peeking, okay?

Speaker 5
All

Speaker 7
pilots are ready for entry.

Speaker 3
Start

Speaker 5
test sequence. Beginning test. Initiate autopilot recording. Inserting simulation plug.

Speaker 6
Connecting the system with the simulation bodies. The simulation

Speaker 4
plug is now under

Speaker 6
the Magi's control.

Speaker 4
Man, that was fast. The Magi are magnificent. It's hard to believe that the first test took a whole week.

Speaker 3
Test duration will be three hours. How do you feel?

Speaker 7
It feels quite hard. Yeah, it's a little different from the other times. Something's wrong with my senses. My right arm's clear. Everything else feels fuzzy. Ray, focus on moving the right hand.

Speaker 4
Right.

Speaker 5
Data collection is proceeding nicely.

Speaker 3
Everything's looking good. Return the Magi to normal. Huh? A dilemma? Huh? You can sure feel their creator's personality, can't you? What are you talking about? Aren't you the one who created them?

Speaker 4
You don't know anything, do you? That's because, unlike me, you never talk about yourself, Ritsko.

Speaker 3
No, I don't. I only created the system uplinks. The basic theorems in the mainframe were my mother's.

Speaker 10
Are you double-checking this? Yes, sir. These are the parts that were installed three days ago. The parts that are showing signs of deterioration. The 87th protein wall. With magnification, you can see some discoloration, but I can't identify it.

Speaker 11
It's got to be corrosion. There are slight variations in the temperature and conduction rate of the spots. The clean rooms have been deteriorating a lot lately. The construction schedule was cut

Speaker 10
by 60 days, so it's possible some air bubbles might have gotten inside. B-Wing's construction is rather substandard. Well, this building was thrown up after the Angels appeared.

Speaker 11
It's nobody's fault. Everyone was so exhausted back then.

Speaker 12
Well, just fix it by tomorrow, or Akari will chew our asses off.

Speaker 3
Understood.

Speaker 6
Another leak? No, it's some kind of corrosion in the protein wall above this floor. Just

Speaker 3
great.

Speaker 6
Could it affect this test?

Speaker 3
No, not at the moment, ma'am. Then let's continue. We can't abort complex experiments because of minor technical problems. Akari would chew my ass off. Understood.

Speaker 6
Synchronization position is correct.

Speaker 5
Connecting simulation entry plugs to AVA via the simulation bodies. Contact with AVA0 has been confirmed.

Speaker 9
AT field will generate R2.

Speaker 6
What's happening? Contamination alert! It's in Sigma unit on the A floor! The

Speaker 5
87th protein wall is corroding and releasing heat. Abnormality in six pipe detected.

Speaker 6
Corrosion of the protein wall is increasing at an incredible rate. It's spreading everywhere. Abort the test. Shut

Speaker 3
off all flow through the six pipe system. Right.

Speaker 5
Numbers 60, 38, and 39 are all hermetically sealed. Corrosion present in six through 42.

Speaker 6
It's no good. The corrosion

Speaker 3
effect is spreading along the walls. Deploy polysomes.

Speaker 8
Set laser power at maximum. Snap every invasive particle.

Speaker 6
Corrosion is reached 6 through 58. It's here! Ray! Ray's simulation body, it's moving! Impossible! The corrosion is still spreading! It's invading the simulation body's active water system!

Speaker 7
How's Rey? She's alright! Eject the entry plugs immediately! Use the lasers!

Speaker 4
That's an AT field! It can't be. Is that an...?

Speaker 3
Pattern analysis is blue. ID confirmed. An angel.

Speaker 13
An angel? You let an angel get inside these facilities?

Speaker 9
I'm sorry, sir.

Speaker 13
No time for excuses. Right. Let's cut off Central Dogma. Isolate it from the Sigma unit.

Speaker 11
Initiate physical lockout of Central Dogma.

Speaker 2
Evacuate immediately.

Speaker 11
Abandon the box.

Speaker 4
What the hell are you doing? Come on.

Isolating Sigma unit from B4. Closing all partitions.

All personnel in the area must evacuate.

Speaker 14
I know that. Take care of it. Cancel the red alert. Very good. Call the committee. Tell them there was an error in our alarm system. Daminated area is still descending, sir. It's spreading all over Sigma unit from the Privnow box! That's too close. Yes, much too close to Adam. We must stop the Angel inside Sigma unit. If necessary, sacrifice the Geo front. Ava status. They're standing by in the seventh cage. We can launch them as soon as the pilots are recovered. There's no need to wait for the pilots. Launch them immediately.

Speaker 11
What?

Speaker 14
You will launch Unit 1 first. If necessary, the other two Evangelions are to be abandoned. Unit

Speaker 11
1 has priority? But sir, how can we possibly destroy this Angel without the Avas?

Speaker 14
If the Avas are contaminated first, we'll be finished. Get moving! Yes, sir!

Central Dogma's Sigma unit will be locked down in 60 seconds. Thirty seconds until vacuum pump activation.

Speaker 11
So that's the new Angel. Time to take a break, I think.

Speaker 9
Central Dogma has been sealed. Megadeth facilities are all occupied by the intruder.

Speaker 12
So, how do we fight the Angels without the Avas?

Speaker 3
Look at this. The border between the normal and heavy water. There's a higher oxygen content. Yeah, their preference is pretty obvious.

Speaker 10
It looks like the place where ozone is vented in to maintain aseptic conditions isn't contaminated. Does that

Speaker 6
mean its weakness is ozone?

Speaker 4
It would seem so.

Speaker 10
Injecting ozone. Ozone concentration increasing. It's working alright. Will this work?

Speaker 6
Zero A and zero B seem to be recovering. The

Speaker 10
area around the pipes is getting back to normal. True, but the central mass is proving more resistant. Alright, inject more ozone.

Speaker 3
Huh? What the...

Speaker 11
Uh-oh. It's not shrinking. Something's wrong. Heat levels are rising dramatically.

Speaker 6
It's not working. The ozone's not working anymore.

Speaker 11
I don't believe it. It's absorbing the ozone.

Speaker 3
Stop the ozone. Amazing. It's actually evolving.

Speaker 2
What's going on?

Speaker 11
We've got an unidentified intruder. Someone's hacking into the subcomputer. Ah, not now. They're coming in C mode. We can't stop them. We've got to unfreeze the barrier. Open a decoy entry.

Speaker 1
Decoy

Speaker 11
entry has been avoided. Running barrier. Barrier has been penetrated.

Speaker 5
Opening another false entry.

Speaker 11
Trace completed. The hacker's in this building. It's under B-Wing. In the Primnow box.

Speaker 6
The optical pattern is changing!

Speaker 11
Those glowing lines are electronic circuits. It's an organic computer. I'm opening a new decoy entry. Negative. Too much interference.

Speaker 4
Cut off the main

Speaker 11
cable.

Speaker 5
Negative. It refuses to accept the command.

Speaker 6
Utilize the

Speaker 11
lasers.

Speaker 6
It's generating an AT field. There's no effect.

Speaker 11
Intruder is accessing the main security banks. It's cracking the passcode. 12th digit, 16th digit, it's in! - My God! - It's broken into the main pegs! It's reading all the files! We can't stop it! It's

Speaker 12
got all our codes! - What in the hell is it looking for?

Speaker 11
- It's scanning the main directories! Accessing codes for, oh my God! It's going after the Magi system!

Speaker 14
- Shut down the I/O system. System shutdown!

Speaker 11
Three, two, one! Quick and set it down!

Speaker 6
The Angel is entering the computers! It's made contact with Melchior! The Angel is taking over Melchior! What? Melchior is being reprogrammed by the Angel! Melchior auto self

Speaker 15
-destruct has been initiated.

Speaker 16
Overruled.

Speaker 11
Overruled.

Speaker 16
Overruled. Overruled.

Speaker 11
No! It's taking over Melchior! And it's hacking into Balthazar! Fast! Too fast! Its calculation speed is incredible!

Speaker 3
Change the login mode! Change synchronization code to every 15

Speaker 10
seconds! Roger! Yes ma'am!

Speaker 12
How much time did

Speaker 10
we buy? At least two hours, I think.

Speaker 14
The Magi have become our enemy.

Speaker 3
This angel must be composed of a group of nanomachines, each the size of a virus. These nanomachines then group together to form colonies, and in a very short period of time, they mutate in a focused exponential series to form a sophisticated intelligent circuit.

Speaker 12
Evolution.

Speaker 3
Yes. They're continuously changing and adapting themselves to attain the best system to cope with any environment they may encounter.

Speaker 12
I understand. It's this angel survival mechanism. Total adaptability. The

Speaker 4
only effective countermeasure for an enemy that continually evolves to overcome its own weakness is to eliminate the host. If the Magi died, the Parasites died too. Therefore, Commander, I propose the physical

Speaker 3
destruction of the Magi. Impossible! Destroying the Magi means destroying headquarters itself! That's my recommendation as Head of Operations! You're out of line! This situation is the responsibility of my department! Why are you being so stubborn? This whole thing is a result of

Speaker 4
my carelessness. Why do you have to be like this? You never share the responsibility. Why won't you trust someone else? As long as this Angel keeps evolving,

Speaker 3
we still have a chance.

Speaker 14
By controlling its evolution.

Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

Speaker 14
We must structure an evolution that leads to self-destruction, death itself.

Speaker 12
We'll set it up so that absorbing the Magi will lead to an evolutionary dead end. If

Speaker 3
the Angels believe it to be their only practical means of survival, they may choose to coexist with the Magi's system.

Speaker 11
But how?

Speaker 3
What's your plan? Since this Angel is like a computer, we could hack into it by connecting it to Kaspar. Once we've done that, we could then upload some kind of auto-self-destruct program. But

Speaker 6
in order to do that, we'll have to remove the barriers that are protecting the last Magi.

Speaker 14
But if Kaspar is faster than the Angel, we'll succeed.

Speaker 4
Yes. This program, can it be ready in time? If Kaspar's taken over first, it'll be all over.

Speaker 3
I keep my promises.

Speaker 9
Red alert. Red alert. An emergency has occurred in Nerve headquarters. All D-class personnel must be back. - Fine.

Speaker 6
- What are those paper things, ma'am?

Speaker 3
- These are the developer's personal notes. - My god, they're access codes, the Magi secret codes. It's like having a map to all of

Speaker 6
the Magi's back doors! Am I allowed to see these? I can't believe this is all INTC! Schematics! Everything! With these notes, we can program much faster than we thought. Right, ma'am?

Speaker 3
Mm-hmm. Thanks, Mom. With your help, we can make it.

Speaker 3
*Bell rings* Okay. Wrench, please.

Speaker 4
Hey, doesn't this remind you of our college days? Board number 25, please. So, why don't you tell me all about the Magi? It's a

Speaker 3
long story. Do you know about the personality transplant OS?

Speaker 4
Yeah. It's a system for implanting personality onto a seventh generation systematic computer to allow the system to think for itself. The same

Speaker 3
technology is used for operating the A-blast. The Magi's programming used one of the first test subjects. So, since my mother was the one who developed the technology... Wait. You mean it was her personality that

Speaker 4
was transplanted?

Speaker 3
That's right. In a very real sense, the Magi's brains are my mother. Is that why you want to protect the Magi? I don't think so. Actually, to be quite honest, I never really liked my mother.

Speaker 4
My

Speaker 3
decision was that of a scientist.

Speaker 11
It's happening! Balthazar is being taken over! Flash

Speaker 15
-Eye auto self-destruction sequence has been determined. It started! Will occur 20 seconds after all three AI consent. Area of destruction will include geoid depth minus 280, minus 140, and floor 0. Under special command 582.

Speaker 11
Balthazar is now invading Casper! They're faster than us. They're faster, right?

Speaker 15
But... T minus 20 seconds to self-destruct.

Speaker 11
My God! Casper will be taking over in 18 seconds! T minus

Speaker 15
15 seconds to self-destruct. Ritzko, hurry!

Speaker 2
Don't worry!

Speaker 11
I've got one whole second to spare. Only

Speaker 6
one second? That's

Speaker 6
not a zero or a minus. Maya! We can do it!

Speaker 15
Hit it! One, zero. Autonomous self-destruct has been cancelled. Special Command

Speaker 2
582

Speaker 15
is cancelled.

Speaker 2
Mash

Speaker 1
-Eye system returning

Speaker 15
to normal mode. Red Alert has been cancelled.

Speaker 9
Red Alert has been cancelled. Red Alert has been cancelled. All hands return to

Speaker 16
first state alert. What's going on out there?

Speaker 9
How am I going to get out of here naked? Somebody Somebody help me! Sigma unit has been released. T-minus zero three to magi reactivation.

Speaker 3
I must be getting old. These all-nighters are really rough. Yeah, but at least you kept your

Speaker 4
promise again. You did good. Oh, thank you.

Speaker 3
You know, this is the first time I've ever really appreciated this paint thinner you call coffee. The night before she died, my mother told me that the Magi were the three aspects of her life. Herself as a scientist, herself as a mother, and herself as a woman. Those three aspects of her are struggling for dominance inside the Magi. She intentionally implanted the dilemmas of the human experience into it. Actually, each of the three programs are slightly different as well. You know, I don't think I'm the kind of woman who will ever have children of my own, So I don't really understand her as a mother, but I respected her as a scientist. However, when it came to her as a woman, I hated her.

Speaker 4
Well, you're rather talkative today.

Speaker 3
About some things. The program that was installed in Caspar was the one of my mother as a woman. And she stayed a woman down to the very last second. How totally like my mother. *BANG

Speaker 16
In other words, darling kiss me Fill my heart with song out, let me sing forevermore You are all I long for, all I wish you'd bend the door In other words, please be true. In other words, I

Speaker 17
love you. Are the angel attacks and Ikari's responses actually ordained by the Dead Sea Scrolls? Sele, the secret organization that controls both Nerve and the Human Instrumentality Project, joins with Ikari to verify the events of both the past and present.

Speaker 2
Will the answers be revealed?
