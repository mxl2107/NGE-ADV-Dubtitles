1
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,500
Misato and Ayanami scare me.

2
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,000
Help me.

3
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,340
Help me, Asuka.

4
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,660
Hey, quit fooling around.

5
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Come on.

6
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,740
Asuka, wake up.

7
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,000
This isn't funny anymore.

8
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,540
Asuka, wake up!

9
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,880
Asuka!

10
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,260
Asuka!

11
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,580
Help me.

12
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,780
Asuka, please help me.

13
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,180
I need you.

14
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,400
Please, Asuka, help me.

15
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,380
Call me an idiot like you always do.

16
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,440
Just say something, damn it.

17
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,820
Please.

18
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,700
Wake up!

19
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,340
I'm so

20
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,080
fucked up.

21
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,680
All access to and from headquarters has been restricted?

22
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,680
We're on first level alert.

23
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,620
That doesn't make sense.

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,860
I thought Kwaru was the last angel.

25
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,380
He was. All the angels have been defeated.

26
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,140
So if we're all safe, then what are we doing on first level alert?

27
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,980
What's going to happen to Nerve and the Evas?

28
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,280
I wish Dr. Akagi was here.

29
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,600
Well,

30
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,000
I think Nerve is probably just going to be disbanded.

31
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,060
And I don't even want to think about what they're planning to do with us.

32
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,180
All we can do is wait and see.

33
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,580
So mankind, a race of flawed and incomplete separate entities, has reached the end of its evolutionary potential.

34
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,880
The Instrumentality Project will manufacture the evolution of manned separate entities into a single consummate being.

35
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,800
And the Committee won't use Nerve or Atom. They'll use the Evas. Just like Kaji said they would.

36
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,760
The time is at hand. Without the Lance of Longinus, we cannot use Lilith to complete the Project.

37
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,180
Our only hope is to proceed using Lilith's only true offspring, Eva Unit One.

38
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,760
That was not part of Sele's original plan.

39
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Creating the Evangelion was the pinnacle of mankind's existence.

40
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,060
Humanity must evolve and shape this brave new world.

41
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,520
That was why we created the Eva series.

42
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,100
We need not cast aside our human form to use Evangelion as our own private arc.

43
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,640
It's merely part of the process to free us all for rebirth.

44
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,700
The fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth.

45
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,920
Through the sacrament of death, God, humanity, and all living beings will be united and reborn as one.

46
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,300
Death creates nothing.

47
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,800
Your death will create an opportunity.

48
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Mankind exists because it has the will to live.

49
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,640
After all, that's why she chose to remain in the Ava.

50
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,860
So... that's what really happened during the second impact.

51
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,720
They're on to me.

52
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
No, wait. Something else.

53
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,680
Showtime.

54
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,900
Transfer the left circuits to the emergency communication systems.

55
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,660
Use satellite feed if you have to.

56
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,540
Correct. What's the right side status?

57
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,040
Negative.

58
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,220
All outgoing network lines are being systematically cut off.

59
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
They're going after the Magi.

60
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,960
Data upload from external terminals. Sir, it looks like they're trying to hack into the Magi.

61
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,720
Just as I thought. Is the uplink coming from the Magi 2 and Matsushiro?

62
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,660
No, there are five Magi systems working together. I've identified Germany, China, and the US.

63
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,400
So Sele is pooling all its resources. Five Magi working against one. Not good odds.

64
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,580
The fourth firewall has been

65
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,020
breached!

66
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,360
Locking the main database. Negative!

67
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,100
The system is being overtaken!

68
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,780
They've breached the next level! The backup system didn't even slow them down!

69
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,500
This is bad.

70
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
If they capture the Magi, it's all over for us.

71
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,260
Let me guess. They need help with the Magi's self-defense system.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,880
That's right. Report to the Second Command Center, where you will be briefed by Lieutenant Ibuki.

73
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,220
He

74
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,500
expects the woman he abandoned to jump when he calls.

75
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,340
Arrogant bastard.

76
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,820
Talk to me,

77
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,100
Hyuga.

78
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
Tokyo-2 is lunch. Special Order A-801.

79
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,420
What's that supposed to mean?

80
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,680
Nerves, legal protection, and jurisdiction have been revoked.

81
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,159
Command has been transferred to the Japanese government.

82
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,659
They only gave us one warning.

83
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,960
It's a mess up here. They tried to take over the magi, but we've been able to minimize most of the damage so far.

84
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,680
Ibuki here. Dr. Akagi is currently installing additional defense programs.

85
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,980
Huh?

86
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,260
Ritsuko?

87
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,280
Am I doing something stupid?

88
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,240
The interaction between men and women is so illogical.

89
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,560
Isn't that right?

90
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,540
Mother.

91
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,820
How much longer?

92
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,480
We should make it. Dr. Akagi is amazing.

93
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,460
One more minute and she'll be at page 120 in the manual.

94
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,120
Just hacking into

95
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,380
the Magi? Yeah,

96
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:30,900
right.

97
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
Doubt they're gonna let us off that easily.

98
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,960
The Magi was just foreplay.

99
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,840
Sele is planning to launch an all-out offensive against headquarters and take the two Evas by force, aren't they?

100
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,720
Of course. We have both Adam and Lilith.

101
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,160
No wonder the old bastards are so nervous.

102
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,840
External feed to the Magi has been halted. A Da Nang B-type defense program is in place.

103
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,980
External access has been cut off for the next 62 hours.

104
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,700
Well, Mother, I'll see you soon.

105
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,360
Ikari has installed a Type 666 firewall on the Magi's external feed circuits.

106
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,180
That's very difficult to breach.

107
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,880
Apparently we will have to forgo

108
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,800
acquisition of the Tokyo Three Magi.

109
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,640
I had hoped to settle this peacefully, but he leaves me no choice.

110
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,740
Launch the invasion forces immediately.

111
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,780
Showtime, ladies.

112
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,260
All units move out.

113
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,340
We've lost

114
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,240
radar feed from sectors 8 through 17.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,520
A large detachment of special force units

116
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,240
has invaded the outer defense perimeter. Two more units are in the Gotemba sector.

117
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,280
After all we've been through, our final enemy is our fellow man.

118
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,260
All personnel go to level 1 battle stations.

119
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Battle stations?

120
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,940
This isn't an angel attack. We can't kill humans.

121
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,240
I wish those bastards felt the same way.

122
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Huh?

123
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,180
What's happening?

124
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,860
Hey!

125
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,880
What's wrong?

126
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,080
Transmission from the southern hub has been interrupted.

127
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,860
Uh...

128
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Southern hub station has gone silent.

129
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,160
The west side attack is just a decoy.

130
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,260
If they're really after the Evas, they'll go after the pilots first.

131
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,740
Tell Shinji to stand by in unit one, got it?

132
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,300
Roger.

133
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,880
Where's

134
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,260
Asuka?

135
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,440
She's still in recovery.

136
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,640
Get her suited up and get her in Unit 2!

137
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,520
Asuka's barely conscious. There's no way she'll be able to synchronize.

138
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,020
If they find her, they're going to kill her. If we put her in Unit 2, at least she'll be safe.

139
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,440
Understood, ma'am. Cease Pilot's medical treatment and prepare her for launch.

140
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
As soon as Asuka's in there, stow

141
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
Unit 2 at the bottom of the lake.

142
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,220
It's not the best hiding place, but it's better than the cage.

143
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,140
Where's Rey?

144
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,720
Unable to locate! Pilot of Unit 0 is missing!

145
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,720
They will kill her!

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Find her now!

147
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,320
*Gunshot*

148
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,860
Launching Unit 2 via Gate Number 8. The airway will remain at a depth of 70 meters.

149
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,840
Get ready to deploy Unit 1! Station it in the geo-front!

150
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,160
We can't! Shinji isn't there!

151
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,460
*gasp*

152
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,540
Oh dear

153
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,040
god!

154
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,500
The number three underground barricade has been destroyed!

155
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060
Enemy forces have begun evading level two!

156
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,420
There's nothing

157
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,000
more that we can do to hold them off.

158
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,180
Our defeat has become inevitable.

159
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,700
Professor Friutski, take care of this please.

160
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,140
Yes, Commander. Please give my regards to Yui.

161
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,200
Internal monorail track

162
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,540
57 has been destroyed!

163
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,880
This is brutal. I'd rather be fighting the angels.

164
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,880
Of course we don't normally fight human enemies.

165
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,560
*Groans*

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Ugh!

167
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,120
Sever those cables! Start with the red ones!

168
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,320
*Screams

169
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,320
*

170
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,220
Hit 'em again.

171
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,160
*Screams*

172
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,900
Level 3 block B has been invaded!

173
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,160
There's no stopping them!

174
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,320
Enemy presence confirmed in block F. The main bypass is under fire!

175
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,780
Seal off levels 1 through 3! Order a full retreat!

176
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,220
Release Bakelite infusion in all passages through section 803!

177
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,680
Right!

178
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,780
Well, that should buy us some time.

179
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,140
Major Katsuragi, Route 47 is completely blocked!

180
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,100
The third unit can't move forward!

181
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:29,840
Shinji is

182
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,560
totally cut off!

183
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,180
All non-combat personnel should avoid engaging the enemy.

184
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,300
These guys are pros, so if you can't retreat to Central Dogma, you're better off just surrendering.

185
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,140
Take care of things here for me.

186
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:49,900
Right.

187
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,600
This is harder than we thought.

188
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,660
We never get the easy jobs.

189
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,780
This is insane.

190
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,980
The center was made to withstand angel attacks, not invading armies.

191
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,200
Safety off.

192
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,320
Yeah, we could barely hold off terrorists.

193
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,920
If the JSSDF

194
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,420
decides to mount an all-out invasion, we're totally screwed.

195
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,100
Slowly but surely they've been cutting our defense budget.

196
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,380
I wouldn't be surprised if they've been planning this from the very beginning.

197
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,240
I wouldn't be surprised either.

198
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:20,460
HYAH!

199
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,860
*Gasp*

200
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,260
Ray.

201
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,520
Ray.

202
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,360
I knew I'd find you here.

203
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,920
The time has come.

204
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,339
Let's go.

205
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,699
Level 1 has been secured, over!

206
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,260
Roger that. We are moving in on the Magi in the Level 2 Command Center.

207
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,380
We are currently engaged in combat.

208
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,920
Please... Jesus... Please...

209
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,400
Class

210
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,940
cooling of

211
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,040
the

212
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,200
Bitma Volgia sector immediately.

213
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:46,400
Terminate EVA pilots on site. Execution of non-combat personnel has been authorized.

214
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,720
Inangahara and Shinjo units, proceed to lower level.

215
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,860
We've located the third child, commencing termination.

216
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,260
Sorry kid, nothing personal.

217
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:02,980
Hey!

218
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,220
What?

219
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,000
Hey, no offense taken.

220
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,660
Let's get you to Unit 1. Come on.

221
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,060
What's the status of Detachment 7? Have

222
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,200
you reached the cage? Over?

223
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,140
Roger that! We have the purple unit surrounded. The Bakelight infusion was not a problem.

224
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,080
The red unit has been launched. We're attempting to establish

225
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,000
which launch route was used. Over.

226
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:39,020
Damn. They're trying to prevent contacts between Shinji and Unit 1. We're running out of time.

227
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,880
This is it, Shinji.

228
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,380
Do you want to run away or do you want to pilot the Eva?

229
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,440
It's your call.

230
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,280
If you sit there and do nothing, then you're already dead!

231
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,040
Help me, Oscar. Help me.

232
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,820
Hiding behind the skirts of a little girl at a time like this?

233
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,360
Snap out of it!

234
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,620
Giving up halfway is worse than never trying at all.

235
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,460
Come on!

236
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,300
Get up!

237
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,160
Move it!

238
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,460
I... I want to die.

239
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,700
Just leave me here.

240
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Stop talking like a stubborn little brat! Like it or not, you're still alive.

241
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,920
Get moving and do something. You can die later.

242
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,320
Unimportant. Securing Terminal Dogma is your number one priority. Understand?

243
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,440
They've

244
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
destroyed just about everything else. Why

245
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,280
don't they just nuke us and get it

246
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,660
over with

247
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:35,880
already?

248
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,700
Hey, if we weren't sitting on top of the original Magi system, they probably would have blown us to bits by now.

249
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,480
I guess that would explain why they haven't used any explosives yet.

250
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,880
I just hope they don't start using BC weapons. Things could get pretty ugly.

251
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,380
That or in two minds.

252
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,780
*Clears throat*

253
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:12,080
*Clears throat*

254
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,860
Speak of the devil.

255
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,840
Damn! Haven't you ever heard of moderation?

256
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:16,940
That

257
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,820
was a little much.

258
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,880
Why can't they possibly want Eva this badly?

259
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,040
They plan to initiate Third Impact using the Eva series instead of the Angels.

260
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:41,840
Fifteen years ago, Second Impact was intentionally engineered by mankind because it was the only way to minimize the potential damage.

261
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,920
They had to reduce Adam to an embryonic state before the other Angels awoke.

262
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,940
You see, Shinji, mankind was spawned from a being called Lilith, just like Adam was.

263
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,440
We are the 18th Angel.

264
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,800
The other Angels are just different possibilities, what we could have become.

265
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,460
They're humans who rejected our human form.

266
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,260
Sadly, we cannot coexist together, even though we are fundamentally the same creatures.

267
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,360
Listen, Shinji, you're going to have to destroy the rest of the Eva series.

268
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,000
It's the only way to stay alive.

269
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,240
The phone lines are all dead.

270
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,520
Yes, sir. Missile impact was confirmed three minutes ago.

271
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,680
This instrumentality project Nerve was secretly researching,

272
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,040
trying to initiate third impact and destroy all of mankind.

273
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,980
The whole thing makes me sick.

274
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,280
Humanity is probably the only creature capable of hating its own kind.

275
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well then, I suppose all we have left to do is to destroy Nerve headquarters.

276
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,800
Should Germany or China begin redevelopment?

277
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,140
No.

278
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:54,560
We won't make the same mistake twice. Make sure no one can touch it for the next twenty years. Like old Tokyo.

279
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,540
Surface heat has dissipated.

280
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,400
High pressure steam discharges have also stopped. All detachment's positions have been confirmed.

281
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,820
Dogma Level 3 and the Purple Unit are currently secured.

282
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,240
What about the red one?

283
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,220
It's in the lake about 70 meters down, Commander. We can't determine whether or not the pilot is alive or dead.

284
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm

285
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,000
still

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,600
alive.

287
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,060
*cough*

288
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,160
*Screaming*

289
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,940
*Screaming*

290
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,580
Don't wanna die.

291
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:36,060
Don't wanna die x3

292
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,960
I don't wanna die...

293
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,740
I DON'T WANNA

294
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,120
DIE!!

295
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
Mama...

296
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,320
You've been here all along?

297
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,440
Mama!

298
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,220
*Ezio

299
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Mama! Mama! Now I understand!

300
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,700
The meaning of the AT field!

301
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,120
You were always protecting me!

302
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,020
Always watching over me!

303
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,920
Always! We were always

304
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,820
together, Mama!

305
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,600
Ebi Unit 2 has activated! Asuka is okay! She's alive!

306
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,040
Asuka!

307
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,660
The cable! Focus on the cable! Use whatever you can to sever it!

308
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,820
Scheist!

309
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,280
Even without my umbilical cable attached, I've still got 12,000 plates of fortified armor!

310
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,700
And I've got my AT field!

311
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,640
There's no way I can lose!

312
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,560
Eat this, ass schnook!

313
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,220
*Mindy music*

314
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,900
That loathsome Evangelion.

315
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,940
Once again our plans will go unrealized. It seems we'll have to fight fire with fire.

316
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,620
The EVA series... it's been completed.

317
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,400
Sele has dispatched all nine of the EVA units equipped with the S2 engines?

318
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,100
That seems like a bit much.

319
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,180
Unless... did they plan to start it here?

320
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,700
I'm not sure how

321
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,800
Affirmative. We have triple protection on the power supply.

322
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,380
As long as you get there in the next three minutes, it'll take you directly to Cage 7.

323
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,480
Destroy the rest of the Ava series, huh?

324
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,520
Is that any way to talk to someone fresh out of the hospital?

325
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,100
9 units in 3 and a half minutes. So that's 20 seconds each with time to spare.

326
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,720
Esther...

327
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,280
This is it.

328
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,940
They got away.

329
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,980
Target has not been terminated.

330
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,100
Should we pursue them?

331
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,580
Over.

332
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,340
Negative.

333
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,300
That area has

334
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,580
been targeted for demolition.

335
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,420
Pull back immediately.

336
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:30,880
Roger

337
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,240
that.

338
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:35,700
Well...

339
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,160
That should hold them off for a while.

340
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,020
Don't worry. It's not as bad as it looks.

341
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,540
The power is still on. There's still time.

342
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,480
Should you listen to me?

343
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,220
From now on, you're on your own.

344
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,580
You'll have to make your own decisions.

345
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,500
No one can do it for you.

346
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,620
I... I can't.

347
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm no good.

348
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,540
I can't pilot Eva if all I do is hurt and kill people.

349
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,060
I thought I had no choice but to pilot Eva, but I was just lying to myself.

350
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm not worthy of piloting an Eva because I don't understand anything.

351
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,280
I'm incapable of doing anything good for anybody else!

352
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
I did something terrible to Asuka.

353
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,220
I killed Garu! I'm a horrible person!

354
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:45,700
I'm dishonest and a coward.

355
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,620
All I ever do is hurt other people, so I'd rather do nothing at all!

356
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm not gonna feel sorry for you!

357
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,100
If you don't like feeling pain, then you can just sit here and let them kill you!

358
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,060
Crying isn't going to solve anything either!

359
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:04,020
You hate yourself, don't you?

360
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,480
That's why you hurt others.

361
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,760
Deep down, you know you suffer more when you cause someone else pain

362
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,320
than if you just let yourself get hurt.

363
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,040
But Shinji, that was your decision, so it makes it a valid choice.

364
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
That's what you wanted, so that makes it worthwhile.

365
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,860
Stop lying to yourself and realize that you do have options.

366
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,900
Then, accept the choices you've made.

367
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,220
But you're not me. You don't know what I have to go through. You don't understand.

368
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,080
So fucking what if I'm not you? That doesn't mean it's okay for you to give up.

369
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:47,080
If you do, I'll never forgive you as long as I live. God knows I'm not perfect either.

370
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,079
I've made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I've done it over and over

371
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,720
again thousands of times.

372
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,960
A cycle of hollow joy and

373
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,020
vicious self-hatred. But even

374
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,100
so, every time

375
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,940
I learn something about myself.

376
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,160
Please, Shinji,

377
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,080
you've got to pilot Eva and

378
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,540
settle this once and for all.

379
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,260
For your own sake.

380
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,500
Find out why you came here.

381
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,360
Why you exist at all.

382
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,780
Answer your own questions.

383
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,940
And when you've found your answers,

384
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,620
come back to me.

385
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
I'll be waiting for you.

386
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,940
Promise me.

387
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,420
Yes.

388
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,400
See you soon.

389
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,840
That was a grown-up kiss. We'll do the rest when you get back, okay?

390
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,300
Okay.

391
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:20,080
If I had known it would end like this, I would have changed the carpet like Asuka suggested.

392
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,240
Pen Right, Pen Pen? Kashi,

393
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,380
my love, I did do the right thing, didn't I?

394
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,260
*crying*

395
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,860
*Gunshot

396
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
*crying*

397
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,820
I've been waiting

398
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,380
for you.

399
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,580
I'm sorry, but when I install the firewall, I change the Magi's programming without telling

400
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:18,940
you.

401
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,240
A loving daughter's final request.

402
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,620
Mother, let's end it together.

403
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,660
It's not working!

404
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:39,780
Why?

405
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,620
Kaspar betrayed me!

406
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,280
Mother, how could you choose your lover over me?

407
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,000
Ritsuko Akagi

408
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,580
The truth is...

409
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,100
Huh.

410
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,300
You liar.

411
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
What's happening up there?

412
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,300
Asuka has less than a minute left in her power reserves.

413
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,460
At this rate...

414
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,120
I cannot be defeated!

415
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,700
Mama?

416
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,080
Mother?

417
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,260
This is the last one!

418
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,700
The lands of Longinus...

419
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:36,740
Internal power supply depleted. Operational limit has been reached. Unit 2 has gone silent.

420
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,080
What the... the destroyed Evaseries units?

421
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
The Eva series has reactivated!

422
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,400
Are they gonna finish her off?

423
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,540
What's going on?

424
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,120
What?

425
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,840
Oh dear god, I'm so scared of what?

426
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,980
Is that? Unit

427
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,260
2?

428
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,020
I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

429
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,620
I'll kill you!

430
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,400
Berserker!

431
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,720
Asuka, stop!

432
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,580
I'll kill you...

433
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,120
I can't get to Eva. There's nothing I can do.

434
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,160
Mother...

435
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,180
Unit

436
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,880
1 has finally awoken.

437
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
*Gasp*

438
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,580
Evangelion Unit 1!

439
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,420
The Devil himself!

440
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,200
Asuka?

441
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,340
I've already joined with Adam.

442
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,480
The only way I will ever see my Yui again is through the forbidden fusion of Adam and Lilith.

443
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,040
We're running out of time.

444
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,540
Your AT field won't hold its shape for much longer.

445
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:12,940
Let us begin, Ray.

446
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,500
Release your AT field, the barrier of your mind.

447
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,580
Discard this unnecessary physical shape.

448
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,440
all souls into one, and then take me to my Yui's side.

449
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,560
Asuka?

450
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,260
Ikari?

451
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,160
There's a high-speed object approaching from lunar space!

452
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,580
What the hell?!

453
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,320
Dear God, the Lance of Longinus returned.

454
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,500
At

455
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,040
last,

456
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,600
our dreams will be realized.

457
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,100
The original

458
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,340
Lance of Longinus has been returned to us.

459
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,060
We are fewer units than we planned, but we'll have to make do.

460
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,820
Bring forth the true form

461
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,260
of the Eva series.

462
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,460
The true form will evangelize humanity.

463
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,740
Through indiscriminate death and through prayer,

464
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,600
we will return to our original state.

465
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,960
And our souls will be at peace.

466
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,020
Let the sacrament begin.

467
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,120
Ava Unit 1 has been captured!

468
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,400
Ascending to 12,000 meters! 12,000 and still rising!

469
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,520
Those bastards!

470
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,180
Sele is planning to use Unit 1 as a medium.

471
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,180
-Eva Unit 1 has been marked with the Holy Stigmata.

472
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,120
-Let us restore the Tree of Life.

473
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,060
The Eva-series have been our faithful servants,

474
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,760
and this is the reason they were created.

475
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,140
The Ava series has unleashed their S2 engines.

476
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,080
Dimensional values are inverting.

477
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:09,900
All

478
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,520
readings negative.

479
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,160
Numerical expression is impossible.

480
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,440
Sweet Jesus, it's an anti-AT field.

481
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,720
The data matches the readings from 15 years ago.

482
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,880
Can it be?

483
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,340
God have mercy.

484
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,740
We have begun third impact.

485
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,640
The S-2 engines have reached critical limit!

486
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,760
Aboard mission! All units fall back!

487
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,860
We're unable to maintain gravitational control!

488
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,140
That's it, ladies. Our mission's a complete failure.

489
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,280
Direct hit! Surface ground layers are melting!

490
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,260
The second wave is eroding headquarters periphery! Out of hull it's been exposed!

491
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,500
These impacts are only physical shock waves.

492
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,180
Set absorbers on maximum. It should hold together.

493
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,780
Here to represent eternity.

494
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,220
The Red Earth Purification Ceremony.

495
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,460
First the Geofront is returned to...

496
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:27,620
Its

497
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,880
original form.

498
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,360
The Egg of Lilith.

499
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,140
Source of all human life.

500
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,980
The Black Moon.

501
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,220
We no longer wish to return inside her shell.

502
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,880
But that is for Lilith to decide.

503
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,040
It appears to have begun.

504
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,960
Now, Rey, it's time to reunite me with Yui once more.

505
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,180
What?

506
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,480
I will not be a puppet for you to control.

507
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,260
Rey,

508
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,780
why?

509
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,820
Because I am not like you.

510
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,900
Rey, please!

511
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:19,940
I

512
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,620
beg you!

513
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,320
Wait! Please, Rei!

514
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,980
I can't. Ikari is calling me.

515
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,600
Rei!

516
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,820
I'm home.

517
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,460
*Dogma

518
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,700
Negative!

519
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,500
It's a... It's human!

520
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,960
*Sigh*

521
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,420
Ayanami!

522
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,600
Rei!

523
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:53,400
Through the destruction of the ego of Unit 1's pilot, humanity shall now be completed.

524
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,320
The third retribution is finally at hand. Amen.

525
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,200
The AT fields of the EVA series are all resonating!

526
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,900
The resonation is increasing!

527
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,440
Have the EVAs begun merging with Rey?

528
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,120
*Pewing sounds

529
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:42,480
*

530
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,400
I can't take it anymore.

531
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,680
I can't take it anymore.

532
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,880
I can't take it anymore.

533
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,680
Is this better?

534
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,000
Have you been right there the entire time?

535
00:56:25,959 --> 00:56:27,640
*Rain*

536
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,740
The solenoid graph is inverting! His ego barrier is getting weaker!

537
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,200
The AT field is shifting to a pattern red!

538
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,120
The fruit of life is held by the angels.

539
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,960
The fruit of wisdom is held by man.

540
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,220
Ever Unit 1 now possesses them both, and therefore becomes God.

541
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,820
Now the source of all souls, the Tree of Life, has been formed again.

542
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,580
Will it be an ark to save mankind from the vacuum of Third Impact?

543
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,080
Or is it a demon that will destroy us all?

544
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,540
The fate of mankind now lies in Shinji's hands.

545
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,820
Tell me, have we done the right thing?

546
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,220
How the hell should I know?

547
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,180
This ray is your heart.

548
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,820
She embodies your hopes and your dreams.

549
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,520
What is it you wish for?

550
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,040
I see.

551
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,180
It's just like when I first started playing the cello.

552
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,980
I thought if I came here, I would find what I was looking for.

553
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:11,800
Mm-hmm.

554
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,140
*cough*

555
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,640
*crying*

556
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,180
*cough*

557
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,060
*punch of laughter*

558
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,360
I wasn't able to be a mother to Shinji after all.

559
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,200
I guess I just do things like that to prove I exist.

560
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,340
That's stupid! It's just two depressed grown-ups licking each other's wounds!

561
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,020
It's nice to feel needed, even if it is just physically.

562
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,060
It makes me feel wanted, and so it makes me happy.

563
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,940
It's just an easy way to convince yourself that you're worth something.

564
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,380
Does Misato really do things like that?

565
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,040
Yes. This is

566
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:30,840
also me.

567
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,460
The me that exists when two hearts are joined as one.

568
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,100
The me that Shinji has never known.

569
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,640
Reality can be painful, but it's something you must learn to accept.

570
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,220
Oh, man! When I grow up, does that mean I'll do the same things Misato does?

571
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,740
You want to kiss me?

572
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,880
You can't.

573
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,280
Why? Are you scared?

574
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,760
That stuff's not for kids.

575
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,600
Here I come.

576
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,620
You don't understand anything. You just stay away from me.

577
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,960
I do understand.

578
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:13,800
You couldn't possibly! You jerk! You really think you can ever know me? You think you can even help me?

579
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:19,120
Don't make me laugh! I can't believe how arrogant you are! You're such a moron!

580
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,920
You will never understand!

581
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,420
How can I ever understand you if you won't say anything?

582
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,540
You never talk to me, but you expect me to understand you! That's impossible!

583
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,160
Did you ever really try

584
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,000
to understand?

585
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,860
Of course I did.

586
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,140
Idiot. I know all about your little jerk-off fantasies about me.

587
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:44,100
Go ahead and do it like you always do. I'll even stand here and watch you.

588
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:49,820
But if I can't have you all to myself, then I don't want anything from you.

589
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,160
Then why don't you try just being nice to me?

590
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,420
We are

591
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,120
nice to you.

592
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,420
LIARS!

593
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,080
You're just hiding behind those

594
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,800
smiles, but you

595
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,240
intentionally keep things ambiguous!

596
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,280
Because the truth causes everyone pain.

597
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,500
Because the truth is very, very traumatic.

598
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,400
But ambiguity only causes me more pain.

599
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,780
That's just an excuse.

600
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,220
But it scares me.

601
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,300
Because I don't know if everyone will stop wanting me again.

602
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,460
I feel awkward and uneasy.

603
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,600
Let me hear your voice.

604
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:18,500
Don't leave me.

605
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,600
I'm begging you.

606
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,120
Please care about me.

607
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,440
I want to stay with you, Asuka.

608
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,920
And I want to help you, but I don't know what to do.

609
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,760
Then don't do anything.

610
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:41,940
Don't come near me.

611
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,260
All you ever do is hurt me.

612
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,340
Asuka, help me.

613
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:47,480
Please.

614
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,080
Asuka, you're the only person that can help me.

615
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:51,940
Liar.

616
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:53,680
Asuka?

617
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,240
Anyone will do.

618
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:58,120
You don't care who it is.

619
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,000
You're afraid of Misato and the first child.

620
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,420
You're afraid of your mother

621
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,440
and father too.

622
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,640
So now you

623
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,780
come running to me.

624
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,100
No, I need you to help me.

625
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:07,680
Because that's the easiest

626
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,960
way to keep from getting

627
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,320
hurt.

628
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,160
You never even loved yourself.

629
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,280
You're all

630
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,000
you have and you never even learned to like yourself.

631
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,660
Pathetic.

632
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,820
Help me.

633
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,940
Somebody, please help me.

634
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:50,440
Help me. Help me. Somebody. Please help me. Somebody help me! Don't leave me alone! Don't abandon me! Please

635
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,400
don't kill me!

636
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,020
No.

637
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,280
*fair

638
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:32,620
*Squeak*

639
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:32,640
*Squeak*

640
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,900
No one understands me.

641
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,060
You never understood anything.

642
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,560
I thought this was supposed to be a world without pain.

643
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,880
And without uncertainty.

644
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,940
That's because you thought that everyone

645
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,380
else felt the same as you do.

646
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,220
You betrayed me! You betrayed my feelings!

647
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,660
You misunderstood from the very beginning.

648
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,040
You just believed what you wanted to believe.

649
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,520
Nobody wants me, so they can all just die.

650
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,740
Then what is your

651
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,480
hand for?

652
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,920
Nobody cares whether or not I exist. Nothing ever changes. So they can all just die.

653
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,620
Then tell me, what is your heart for?

654
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,580
It would be better if I never existed. I should just die too.

655
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,480
Then why are you here?

656
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,660
Is it okay for me to be here?

657
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:25,980
*Screaming

658
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:26,580
*

659
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,120
Pallet response is verging

660
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:30,980
on infinite zero!

661
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,600
Ava series and Geofront are approaching the E layer and still rising!

662
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,720
The Ava series is operational!

663
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:49,380
The anti-AT field from Lilith is expanding and materializing!

664
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,420
Anti-ATFIT

665
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,560
has exceeded critical limits!

666
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:21,100
Soon individual entities will be unable to maintain their separate forms!

667
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,300
The chamber of Guff is open.

668
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:35,220
The door to both the beginning and the end of the world is open at last.

669
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,840
This world is overflowing with sorrow.

670
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:50,260
Its people are drowning in emptiness, and loneliness fills their hearts.

671
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,200
Hikari, did you also finally get to see Yui again?

672
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,580
The AT fields... the AT fields are all disappearing.

673
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,839
Is this the answer? Is this what I

674
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:19,680
was looking for?

675
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:24,460
Dr. Akagi!

676
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:26,480
Maya...

677
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,040
Ritsuko...

678
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,900
Ritsuko... Ritsuko!

679
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:38,240
The beginning and the end are one and the same, yes.

680
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,880
All is right with the world.

681
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,900
I've waited so long for this moment to arrive.

682
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,480
I will finally be with you again, Yui.

683
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,660
When Shinji is near me, all I ever do is cause him pain.

684
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,380
I thought it was better when I did nothing at all.

685
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,720
Were you afraid of Shinji?

686
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:10,160
I didn't believe that anyone could love me.

687
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,380
I never deserved to be loved.

688
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,299
So you were running away.

689
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,279
And you rejected the others around you,

690
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,620
so there was no chance you would ever be hurt.

691
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:25,440
And you were terrified by the invisible bonds that people form.

692
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,440
You were afraid, and so you closed off your heart.

693
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,359
And so this is my retribution.

694
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,140
Forgive me,

695
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,500
Shinji.

696
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:05,640
Oh!

697
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,800
I am only right.

698
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:25,880
I am

699
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:35,520
only

700
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,040
Do I even know you?

701
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,060
Who the hell are you?

702
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,500
I don't need you anymore.

703
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,580
Don't get me wrong.

704
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,260
Please stop.

705
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,080
I can't stand the sight of you.

706
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,000
Get out.

707
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,040
You wimp.

708
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,840
If it's too painful, you can always make it stop.

709
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:29,920
If

710
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,020
you don't like it, you can just run away.

711
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,440
Do you want to be at ease?

712
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,520
Do you want to feel peace of mind?

713
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,760
Do you want to become one with me?

714
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,280
To have our bodies and souls join as one?

715
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,220
I'd rather die than do it with you.

716
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,000
Hey.

717
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:57,980
What is it?

718
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,440
What are...

719
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:00,780
Dreams?

720
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:01,860
Dreams?

721
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:02,860
Yes.

722
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,020
Dreams.

723
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,660
I don't understand. I don't understand what reality is.

724
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,460
You can't bridge the gap between your own truth and the reality of others.

725
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,640
I don't know where to find happiness.

726
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,600
So you only find happiness in your dreams.

727
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,160
Then this is not reality? This world where no one exists?

728
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:55,900
No,

729
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,180
it is only a dream.

730
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,060
Then I don't exist here either.

731
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,380
This convenient fabrication is your attempt to change reality.

732
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,100
Is that wrong?

733
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,680
You were using fantasy to escape reality.

734
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,300
Why can't I dream that I'm alone?

735
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:13,900
That is not

736
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,360
a dream.

737
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,500
That is a

738
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,060
substitute

739
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:16,880
for reality.

740
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,680
So where is my dream?

741
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,880
It is a continuation of reality.

742
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:46,460
But where is my reality?

743
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,740
It is at the end of your dream.

744
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:16,940
*Gasp*

745
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:20,920
Ayanami...

746
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,300
Where are we?

747
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:27,980
This place is a sea of LCL, the primordial soup of life.

748
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:33,520
A place with no AT fields, where individual forms do not exist.

749
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,720
An ambiguous world, where you cannot tell where you end and others begin.

750
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:45,300
A world where you exist everywhere, and yet you exist nowhere, all at once.

751
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,380
So, this is death?

752
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,620
Not quite.

753
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,720
This is a world where we are all one.

754
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,420
This is the world you wished for.

755
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:55,920
Your world.

756
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,320
But this... this isn't right.

757
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,900
This feels wrong.

758
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,800
If you wish for

759
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,600
others to exist, the walls of their hearts will separate them again.

760
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,160
And then they will all feel fear once more.

761
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,840
Okay, then.

762
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:30,660
Thank you.

763
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:39,060
I just felt pain when I existed in that reality.

764
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,920
So I thought it was all right to run away.

765
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,960
But there was nothing good in the place I escaped to either.

766
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,620
Because I didn't exist there.

767
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,500
And so...

768
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,140
No one existed.

769
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,400
Is it all right for the AT field to separate you all and cause you pain again?

770
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,680
I don't mind that.

771
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,900
But what are the two of you within my

772
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,240
heart?

773
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:11,540
We are the hope that people will one day be able to understand each other.

774
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,100
And we are the words, I love you.

775
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,700
But that's just a pretense.

776
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,160
A selfish belief.

777
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,060
Like some kind of prayer.

778
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,760
It can't possibly last forever.

779
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,160
Eventually, I'll be betrayed.

780
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,320
And it will abandon me.

781
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,520
But still, I want to see them again.

782
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:39,340
Because at the time, I know my feelings were real.

783
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:48,360
Reality exists in a place unknown, and dreams exist within reality.

784
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:50,800
And truth lies in your heart.

785
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,860
The contents of a person's heart shapes their appearance.

786
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,340
And new images will change their hearts and their forms.

787
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:05,240
The power of imagination is the ability to create your own future,

788
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:09,300
and the power to create your own flow of time.

789
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,260
But if people don't act of their own free will,

790
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,920
then nothing will change at all.

791
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,040
So, you must regain your own lost form by your own volition.

792
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,360
Even if it means your words become lost

793
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,760
or confused with the words of others.

794
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:38,940
Anyone can return to human form as long as they are able to imagine themselves within their own heart.

795
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,020
Don't worry, darling.

796
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,840
All living creatures have the power to be brought back to life.

797
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,980
And the will to go on living.

798
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,440
Anywhere can be paradise.

799
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,400
As long as you have the will to live.

800
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:23,320
After all, you are alive.

801
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,040
So you will always have the chance to be happy.

802
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:49,500
As long as the sun, the moon, and the earth exist, everything will be alright.

803
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:15,980
Will you be alright,

804
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:16,360
love?

805
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,920
I still don't know where my happiness lies.

806
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:28,660
I'll still think about why I'm here and whether or not it was good to come back.

807
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,840
But that's just stating the obvious over and over.

808
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,760
I am myself.

809
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:46,260
But, Mother, what will you do, Mother?

810
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,660
When man created Evangelion, were we trying to create a clone of God?

811
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,560
Of course. Humans can only exist on this earth.

812
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:12,900
But the Evangelion will be able to exist forever, along with the human soul that dwells within it.

813
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,200
When the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are all gone,

814
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,720
Eva will exist so long as just one person remains.

815
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:26,180
It'll be lonely, but as long as one person still

816
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:26,900
lives...

817
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,600
It will be eternal proof that mankind ever existed.

818
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,880
Goodbye, Mother.

819
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,480
*cough*

820
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,460
*Cries*

821
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,720
*coughing*

822
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,100
How disgusting.
