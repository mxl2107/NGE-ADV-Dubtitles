Speaker 1
The young man I just saw you just look at me I'm smiling at you I'm so happy to touch my heart I'm just curious to see you I'm still not aware of my heart I'm still not aware of my heart But I'll never forget The back of the back of the I will be a little

Speaker 2
more

Don't hesitate. Move ahead. If I can see you again, I will say...

Speaker 2
the words that I could not say eight years ago. Bye.

Speaker 3
Another phone that will never ring.

Speaker 4
Misato's shutting herself off again, as usual. Is Asuka going to come back today?

Speaker 5
She skipped school. She won't go home. All she does is play those games. Hikari? Uh, yes?

Speaker 6
Can I sleep here? Yeah. I'm sorry I'm inconveniencing you. You're not inconvenient. When I didn't win with my Ava, I lost whatever value I might have had. I hate. I hate. I hate everything. And I hate myself the most. I don't care about anything anymore. There's no point.

Speaker 5
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Oscar. You did the best you could. You should be proud. I'm not a child.

Speaker 7
So that child is gone. Yes, even cats die. Don't cry, Grandma. Yes, I'll come home as soon as I have time. I haven't visited Mother's grave in three years. Yes, I'll call you next time. Yeah, so even cats can die.

Speaker 8
It is impossible to retrieve the Lanch of Longiners now. Why did you use it? And what about the Ava series? We don't have them all scheduled yet.

Speaker 9
Destroying the Angels was our top priority. There was no other way. No other

Speaker 8
way? You'd better come up with a more believable excuse.

Speaker 9
Your actions these days belie a lack of respect for this committee. Fyutski, I'm in conference. Understood. Another Angel is approaching. We must finish this later.

Speaker 8
You're assuming you'll still have a seat here? Are you going to betray us, Ikari?

Speaker 3
I'll be there in 15 minutes. Sort a Unit Zero through the 32nd gate. Use Unit Two as the backup. No, I'm sorry. I don't have the authority to cancel the Commander's freeze on Unit One. That's right. Bye. It's another Angel, alright.

Speaker 10
Damn.

Speaker 9
Unit Zero has launched. Advancing to intercept. Unit Two, remain in the launch bay. No. Move it out, sir. What? No arguments. It might be useful as a decoy at least. Right. Ava Unit 2 ready to launch.

Speaker 6
Here I am in this seat again. Am I even linked to this thing anymore? Unit 2, advance

to the 8th gate. Stand ready to move out as soon as your launch position is determined.

Speaker 6
Even if I go, I'll just be a burden on the others.

Speaker 11
Target approaching. It's past the final intercept line at Gora.

Speaker 6
I just don't care anymore.

Speaker 11
The target is above the Wakidani Valley,

Speaker 3
rotating in a fixed position. Target's AT field is still active. Where have you been? I'm sorry, no excuse. Status report! It

Speaker 9
looks like we're in a stalemate, Major. He's right. The target's field pattern keeps cycling

Speaker 7
from blue to orange! What's that mean? The Magi aren't able to answer that question yet!

Speaker 9
We just don't have enough solid data right now.

Speaker 7
However, I'm certain that it's capable of assuming forms besides the one we see now. So we can't attack first.

Speaker 12
Ray, let's hold back and study it for a bit. No,

Speaker 5
it's coming.

Speaker 9
- Ray, efface of action! - She can't!

Speaker 5
There's not enough

Speaker 9
time! Contamination! The target's affecting Unit Zero!

Speaker 7
What's

Speaker 12
the status on Unit Zero's AT field? The field's up, but it's not stopping the Angel's probe!

Speaker 7
Is the Angel trying to establish first level contact with Unit Zero? It must be. We've got biocontamination invading Unit Zero! Ava Unit 2, roll out! Take some of that

Speaker 10
heat off of Ray!

Speaker 3
*Biofusion

Speaker 12
*

Speaker 13
It's sink! Her sink ratio's under 10%! Asuka!

Speaker 3
It just won't move! It won't move? She's just the target sitting out there! Get her back! Do it now!

Speaker 5
Who is this? You. Myself. And an Ava? No, I sense somebody other than myself. Who are you? An angel. Are you one of the beings we call the angels? Don't you want to become one with me? No, I am me, not you. Hmm, but you shall. It's too late. I will share part of my mind with you. Let me share with you these emotions. This is pain. Yes. Do you feel this

Speaker 11
pain? This pain? No, it's different.

*music* You are that sorrowful.

Speaker 5
Is this a tear?

Speaker 9
Am I the one crying? Ray! I want Evangelion Unit 1 taken out of cryostasis. Launch it immediately. What? I said launch it!

Speaker 6
Yes, sir. Why for her? Am I so worthless you couldn't do this for me?

Speaker 3
Spread your AT field to full! Get way out of there now!

Speaker 14
Right!

Speaker 5
Shikari!

Speaker 3
Shinji! You've got to use your progressive knife! *Gunshot*

*Screaming* *Screaming*

You are Akari!

Speaker 5
This is my mind and soul, to become one with Akari. *Gunshot* You will not! Her AT field's

Speaker 10
been reversed! She's got biocontamination everywhere!

Speaker 13
She's trying to contain the angel!

Speaker 12
- -Her field is at its limit. Her core won't be able to hold at this rate. -Rey abandon

Speaker 5
unit zero! -I cannot. If I leave unit zero the AT field will cease to be. I will not let it. -Rey, don't do

Speaker 10
it.

Speaker 14
*Gunshot* The targets

Speaker 12
disappeared. This operation is over. Downgrade alert status to condition yellow.

Speaker 9
Roger. Shifting alert status to condition yellow.

Speaker 3
What's the status of Unit Zero? I don't think the entry plug ejected. So now to rescue team.

Speaker 7
If there's anything left to rescue...

Speaker 2
No antibiotic substances from the 16th Angel have been located as of yet. We'll continue to search.

Speaker 7
The traces of Level C spread out to the southwest.

Speaker 2
Dr. Akagi, we've located the plug!

Speaker 9
Dr.

Speaker 7
Akagi... Here is top secret. Clean out the plug and destroy everything. Understood. Do it now!

Speaker 8
At last, we have defeated all of the Angels up to the Sixteen. Now there is only one left. As it is written in Xela's Dead Sea Scrolls. Promised time is at hand. The road has been long and the sacrifices have been great. True. We have lost the Lance of Longinus. And now Unit Zero. That is sufficient reason for

Speaker 1
removing Ikari.

Speaker 8
Surely he must have understood what release of Fielitski

Speaker 11
meant.

Speaker 8
We shall have to find another Katspor to use against Ikari. And this one must know the truth.

Speaker 4
*Bell rings Misato, I can't cry anymore. I feel the pain, but the tears won't come. Why is that? Shinji,

Speaker 12
I don't know what to do or say. All I can do is be here for you. Don't

Speaker 4
touch me! Just leave me alone, Misato. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3
I know how lonely he must be.

Speaker 12
Does the fact that I'm a woman frighten him? Or is he afraid of getting close to anyone?

Speaker 3
Pen-pen, come here.

Speaker 12
It's true.

Speaker 3
Anything is better than being alone. And I'm the one who's lonely.

Speaker 15
Ray, the product of my despair, and yet at the same time, the vessel of your hope. In the end, I suppose it was unreasonable to expect to forget.

Speaker 12
Hello? Yes? What? Shiji!

Speaker 13
Dr. Godai, internal medicine one. Dr. Goddai, please call conference room two immediately.

Speaker 14
Ray! I'm so glad. I can't believe you're alive. Why isn't my father here? Um, I... Thanks for saving my life.

Speaker 5
For doing what?

Speaker 14
You saved me. By sacrificing Unit Zero.

Speaker 5
Oh, did I save you?

Speaker 14
Don't you remember?

Speaker 5
I just don't know. I think I must be the third one. *BOOM*

Speaker 9
*Clocking* is likely to cause a great deal of trouble with Chairman Keel. I've given the old men of Sele something else to look at. There is no problem. It is our intent to carry

Speaker 8
out this Inquisition

Speaker 9
in a dignified

Speaker 8
manner. It is not our intent to bring any shame upon you.

Speaker 7
I don't feel any shame.

Speaker 8
She's a strong woman. I can see why Ikari wants to keep her next to him. However, were you aware that the one who sent you here

Speaker 11
was none other

Speaker 8
than Ikari himself? He refused our request for the pilot of Unit Zero and has sent you here in her stead, Dr. Akagi.

Speaker 7
He sent me instead of her? The way to the truth, which you wanted, was sent by

Speaker 16
36 other methods. But they won't reach you. The only way that is guaranteed is this capsule. This is all I have. Now it's completely up to you as to how to use this. The passcode is our first memory. Goodbye. And take care.

Speaker 12
The silence from you no longer hurts as much as it once did. Not since you gave me your heart and soul.

Speaker 8
So, has Dr. Akagi's deposition proved acceptable? She is not like Fiutsuki. It is more beneficial for us to release her. The woman has rendered remarkable service to the Eva series. Let it continue to be of use for a while.

Speaker 9
For the future of mankind.

Speaker 8
As for the Evangelions themselves, there are now eight under

Speaker 9
construction.

Speaker 8
And four that are not. The disappearance of Tokyo 3 will prove to be a boon to the project. We must accelerate the completion of that day. The promised time will be at hand.

Speaker 4
Hello? Listen

Speaker 7
to me carefully. For the next few minutes, you'll be free from the Secret Service. Come here now while you can.

Speaker 4
Rizko?

Speaker 3
Sorry, it won't work without my password.

Speaker 7
I see. Did Kaji arrange this?

Speaker 12
Show them to me. All the secrets you buried here.

Speaker 7
All right, but this one will see them as well. Agreed.

Speaker 14
This looks just like Rey's room.

Speaker 7
That's not surprising. This is the place where Rei was born.

Speaker 14
She was what?

Speaker 7
She was born here. The visions of light and water that stream through her consciousness are merely reflections of this place.

Speaker 12
Dr. Akagi, this isn't what I came to see.

Speaker 7
I

Speaker 12
know that,

Speaker 7
Misato. Is that... on Ava? The first one. A failure. We abandoned it ten years ago.

Speaker 4
A graveyard for Avis?

Speaker 7
Nothing that elaborate. Just a dumping ground. It's also the place where your mother was taken from you. You may not remember it, but you were watching at the very moment when your mother disappeared. Do you remember that, Shinji? Doctor!

Speaker 12
So, this is the core of a dummy plug? This is

Speaker 7
where we produce the

Speaker 14
components.

Speaker 7
Oh my god, it's Rey. They're all Rey? You mean the dummy plugs are? Uh-huh. These are the cores of the dummy plugs. They're what makes the system work. Who are they? These? These are empty vessels. Nothing but spare parts. Spare rays. Mankind found a god and man. in his folly, tried to make the god his toy. For that arrogance, mankind was punished. That happened 15 years ago, and the god that man found was lost. But man continues to attempt to resurrect the god, and from that god, Adam, man attempted to make a man who was like a god himself, and that was Ava. What? Avas are human? Yes. Yes. Inside the empty shell of each Eva is a human soul. But the only vessel which can hold a soul is Rey. These things are empty husks. They have no souls, no right to live. The room of Gav is empty.

Speaker 10
Stop this! Do you have any idea what you're doing?

Speaker 7
Yes, I know. I'm destroying them.

Speaker 13
These aren't human, just things with human forms But even so, I lost to these things To these soulless dolls I

Speaker 13
couldn't win I could have suffered any humiliation Endured any torture But he had already chosen God, I'm a fool Like mother, like daughter Fools to the end If you want to kill me, go ahead and do it I'd welcome death

Speaker 7
If that's what you want,

Speaker 10
you are a fool. What is this curse

Speaker 12
that consumes all those who come into contact with Ava? *crying

Speaker 10
* Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars Let me see where spring is like on Jupiter and us In other worlds, hold my hand In other words, duly kiss me Fill my heart with song And let me sing forevermore You are all I love for All I love, sip and adore In other words, please Let's be true in other worlds.

Speaker 12
I love you. The city that he had been protecting has disappeared. The friends that he was close to have gone. The girls that he had been drawn to have been consumed by fear. All of Shinji's emotional supports are gone. But now a new friend smiles upon him in the twilight. Shinji gives himself over to that smile, and it's as if all the sins that he has ever committed are gone. But fate has yet another cruel trick in store. Next episode, The Final Messenger.
