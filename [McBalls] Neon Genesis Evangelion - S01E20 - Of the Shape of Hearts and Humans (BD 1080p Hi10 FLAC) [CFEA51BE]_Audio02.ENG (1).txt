Speaker 1
The young man like a poor man You're a young man, you're a fairy tale The blue wind is now on the door I can't wait to see 遥か未来目指すための羽があること 残酷な天使のテゼ 窓辺からやがて飛び立つ ほとばしる熱いパッドスで 思い出を裏切るなら

Speaker 2
It's eating the angel.

Speaker 3
Those bindings allowed us to control it, but now the Ava is removing the web that binds it to our will. The beast inside the Ava is free at last!

Speaker 4
Unit 1's awakened and been set free. Zaylay sure won't stay quiet about this, will they?

Speaker 5
This is insane. The Ava series aren't capable of generating S2 organs themselves, but we never imagined that one would be able to take one into itself this way.

Speaker 2
This incident is at extreme odds with the scenario we created.

Speaker 5
Gando Ikari. It was a mistake to

Speaker 6
entrust nerve to him, wasn't it?

Speaker 7
Hmm.

Speaker 6
But he was the only one who could achieve this project's goals. Ikari, what's going on in your mind? It's begun at last. Indeed. This

Speaker 8
is the beginning.

Speaker 9
The damage the Ava incurred is beyond the Hendlick limit. Yes. It may be a while before we can restore everything to normal. Fortunately, the Magi system can be transferred to a new location. We may be able to begin working as early as tomorrow. This place isn't going to

Speaker 10
be viable anymore. It's just a matter of time before they decide to abandon it. Most likely. But for the time being, we'll have to use the secondary control center. Without the Magi? Yes. We'll clean the dust off and be back in business by this afternoon.

Speaker 9
But the chairs are too cramped down there and the sensors don't operate smoothly. It's difficult to work there.

Speaker 11
Well, at least the layout is the same as our original control center.

Speaker 9
At least we have

Speaker 10
an alternative. We have no choice when it comes to using Unit 1.

Speaker 2
It may be restrained by the cage, but are you sure it's safe?

Speaker 11
Well, no heat emissions, free electrons, electromagnetic fields, or chemical reactions, and the S2 unit's completely inactive.

Speaker 2
Nevertheless, on three separate occasions, Unit 1 has moved without power. You can't judge this situation by just the things you can see.

Speaker 11
Uh-huh. We sure can't take any chances. That's a fact. It's as unpredictable as you are, Major. Uh... sorry.

Speaker 6
However, our concerns are not limited to Unit 1. Correct.

Speaker 7
Serious damage was sustained by Units 0 and 2. Headquarters was partially destroyed, exposing Central Dogma.

Speaker 5
We can't even estimate how much money and time have been lost. This is because we didn't put a bell around

Speaker 6
Ikari's neck.

Speaker 4
A bell was there,

Speaker 6
but it didn't ring. A bell that doesn't ring has no purpose. We'll make sure the bell works next time.

Speaker 4
My, my. What a completely unexpected situation. How will you explain this to the committee? I mean, to Sele?

Speaker 8
There isn't anything to explain. Unit 1 wasn't under our control. This was an accident. Thus, Unit 1 will remain frozen until the committee gives us further orders. Exactly. That is a very appropriate

Speaker 4
decision. However, isn't your son still trapped inside it?

Speaker 9
I knew this was hopeless. It's not accepting the eject code. What about the backup codes? Also refused. Even a direct circuit isn't getting through.

Speaker 11
But the plug's video monitor's still active. I'm channeling it to the main screen.

Speaker 10
What in the hell is this? This is the truth behind a 400% sync ratio.

Speaker 2
I can't believe it! What happened to Shinji? He's

Speaker 10
been taken into Eva Unit 1. Take it into it? What in the hell is an Ava? It's a thing created by man in man's own image. I really can't describe it any other way. Created by man? You didn't create anything. You just copied something you found in the Antarctic. What was the original? That's what I want to know. This is not just a copy. A human will is inside it. Are you saying somebody willed this to happen? Yes, the Ava did.

Speaker 2
Do something, damn it! You created this, didn't you? Take responsibility for what

Speaker 12
you've done!

Speaker 13
I'm still alive. I know that Wonder Girl's still alive! Don't bother me with trivial crap like that, Misato! I can't believe it.

Speaker 3
I couldn't do anything. I can't believe that stupid Shinji outperformed me.

Speaker 10
I can't stand it. What do

Speaker 2
you mean you're

Speaker 10
going to salvage Shinji? Well, theoretically, Shinji's life force still exists in there. Ha! And will you be respecting that life this time? Losing Shinji is out of the question now. Oh, I don't know. What Nerve wants is Unit 1 as their tool, not Shinji. I don't deny

Speaker 9
it. Our assumption is that Shinji's body lost its ego border, and that he's now floating in the entry plug in quantum form. You're saying that Shinji has shifted into a form we can't see? Yes. The LCL has chemically altered into something very similar to the seawater of primitive Earth.

Speaker 10
In fact, it's almost identical to the primordial soup we've duplicated in laboratories. Primordial soup? Yes. All of the substances which composed Shinji are still preserved in the plug, and his soul exists there as well. In fact, his ego image is giving a

Speaker 9
sort of substance to his plug suit. In other words, this salvage operation must both reconstruct his body and return his soul into it. Is that possible? Possible?

Speaker 10
With the Magi's support? Yes, it is. This

Speaker 2
is all theoretical stuff you're talking about, isn't it? You won't know what will really happen until you do it.

Speaker 14
What is this? Where am I? The entry plug of Unit 1? But there's nobody here. Not even myself. What is this? I don't understand. These people. Yes, they're people I know. People who know me. I understand now. This is my world. What is this? This is supposed to be my world, but this I don't understand. An image from outside. A hostile image? That's right. The enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Our enemies are something called angels. They have the names of the angels, too. They are the targets of Eva and Nerve. This is our revenge for the death of Misato's father. But why do I fight? Why do I do this despite all the pain and suffering?

Speaker 13
What are you, stupid? An unknown enemy is attacking us. Of course we have to fight them. Who cares what they think?

Speaker 14
Am I odd to try to find a reason to fight? Am I not supposed to think about it? Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. All are my enemies. That which threatens us is the enemy. Of course, how can I be faulted for protecting my own life and those of others? Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. Enemy. My enemy. Enemy. Enemy. My enemy. Damn it. Damn it. God damn it. You hurt Doji and killed my mother!

Speaker 14
FATHER! Why do you hate your father? Anyone would hate him. He's no father at all. You don't understand him, do you? Of course not. In 14 years, I've hardly ever even seen him. Is that why you hate him? Yes. My father doesn't need me. My father deserted me! Am I a substitute? Yes! That's got to be it! He abandoned me because he already

Speaker 2
had Ayanami! As if you didn't already run away yourself.

Speaker 14
No! It's all his fault! That time I was actually going to tell him I hate him! Did you make me become a pilot just to make me suffer?

Speaker 5
Correct.

Speaker 14
How can you say that?! You have to be so called! It's not fair! You didn't even need me, did you?

Speaker 4
I called you because I had a use for you.

Speaker 14
But why? Why is it me?

Speaker 8
Because there is no one else who can do it.

Speaker 14
No way. Why haven't I ever seen this before? It's not fair! It's not possible! That's right! I already knew Ava! I already knew Ava! And then I ran away, leaving my father and mother behind!

Speaker 5
Current

Speaker 10
concentration of

Speaker 1
LCL stable at 36. Oxygen concentration is nominal.

Speaker 5
Electromagnetic radiation pulse is normal. Weight pattern is zero.

Speaker 1
All counters are functioning normally.

Speaker 9
Salvage operation guidelines. It's incredible that you were able to come up with all this in just one month.

Speaker 10
Thanks for the credit, but this isn't all my work. The majority of this data is from ten years ago. What

Speaker 9
data from ten years ago? Has this happened before? Yes, but it was before I started working here.

Speaker 10
It was during my mother's time. But I can still pick her brains.

Speaker 9
Then how

Speaker 10
did it come out ten years ago? They didn't succeed.

Speaker 14
Kindness. Warmth. Is this warmth a part of being human? I was never aware of it until now. I was never aware of it before, but now I think I know what it is. I didn't know what it was, but now I think I understand. They are. Because... because I pilot an Ava. That's why they treat me so well. That's the reason I keep going on. It's the justification for my continuing existence. Who and why I am. That's why I have to pilot the Ava. To fight. I have to fight the ones that they call our enemy. That I have to win. That's right. I can't lose. I must be the pilot. I must do what they tell me to do. And I've got to win. Just like they tell me to. Otherwise, I'm nobody. Nobody.

Speaker 10
Work hard. Work hard, Shinji. Get to work, you stupid idiot. Yeah, work hard.

Speaker 14
You gotta work hard.

Speaker 7
Good job, Shinji.

Speaker 14
Misato, Ritsuko, Asuka, Toji, Kinsuke, Father. They all respect me. They respect me when I pilot the Eva. They all respect me. They respect this totally worthless being. They all tell me piloted, so I'll prove to my father that I'm worth something. Work hard, Shinji. But I am working hard. I am. Somebody, please. Somebody be nice to me. I fought so much. I'm doing the best I can. Can't you treat me better? Can't you be nice to me? Why can't you be nice to me?

Speaker 2
I'm nice to you. Tell me, Shinji, do you want to become one with me? To be of one mind and body? It could be very, very nice. Ask me anytime. I'm ready. Hey,

Speaker 13
Shinji, you idiot. Don't you want to be one with me? To be of one mind and body? It would be really awesome. You ought to appreciate your good fortune. Come on.

Speaker 2
Ikari. Do you want to become one with me? To be of one mind and body? It could be very pleasant. Shinji? Do you want to become one with me? To be of one mind and body and soul? It could be very pleasant. Relax and release your soul.

Speaker 14
All of the probes have been inserted. Electromagnetic radius is fixed at zero minus three.

Speaker 9
Eagle water pulse connection is complete. Roger, start the salvage operation.

Speaker 11
Initiating program. Transmitting burst signal. Signal received. No rejection.

Speaker 9
Proceed to send the second and third signals.

Speaker 10
Affirmative. Shift the subject to stage two. Come on, Shinji.

Speaker 2
Stupid Shinji.

Speaker 11
Shinji

Speaker 2
Akari.

Speaker 11
Hey, Shinji!

Speaker 2
Yo, Shinji! Ikari. Shinji. Stupid Shinji. Shinji Ikari. Hey, Shinji. Yo, Shinji! Ikari.

Speaker 7
Shinji. Stupid Shinji. Stupid Shinji. Shinji Ikari.

Speaker 9
It's no good! His ego borderline is frozen into a fixed loop! Try to radiate the wave patterns from all directions!

Speaker 3
My god! All of the radiated signals are being trapped in Klein space! What does that mean? It means we failed. Abort intervention! Reverse the tangent graph! Set the addition value at zero. Right!

Speaker 11
Distudo reaction in the Q area. Pattern is sepia. I've got a change in the core pulse 2! Plus O3, confirm!

Speaker 3
Maintaining current condition has

Speaker 9
priority! Stop that backbone! Right! Plus.5! .8! This is all wrong! I can't stop it! What's going on?!

Speaker 14
Don't you want to come back? Why, Shinji? I don't... I don't understand myself. I... What do I want?

Speaker 15
What do you want? What do you want, Shinji?

Speaker 9
The EVA is rejecting the

Speaker 15
signal!

Speaker 11
Shinji's ego formation is disintegrating in the LCL! Pressure in the plug is increasing! Aboard all operations! Power

Speaker 9
down! It's not working! The plug is being ejected! *BOOM* *BOOM*

Speaker 14
SHANJI!

Speaker 14
*GASP* Where am I? Inside the Ava! Inside the Ava? Did I pilot the Ava again? But why? You won't pilot the Ava anymore? I decided that I would never pilot Ava again.

Speaker 2
But you have just piloted Evangelion Unit 1. Shinji, you are here because you have piloted the Eva. Piloting the Eva has created your present. You can

Speaker 16
never deny your past,

Speaker 2
Shinji. Nor can you deny the fact that you did indeed pilot it once more. That which is, is. It's true. I just wanted to tell you that only you can decide. It's your future. Only you can decide, Shinji. You must make a choice.

Speaker 14
I...

Speaker 2
I... I am science! It can't even save one small life! Give me back my Shinji! GIVE HIM BACK!

Speaker 14
That scent... a human smell... Misato? Ayanami? No, not that. That's right. This is the smell of my mother. The second

Speaker 8
impact has occurred. Must he live in this hell?

Speaker 15
Anywhere can be heaven, as long as you try to live. And because he is alive, for as long as he lives, he will have a chance to attain happiness.

Speaker 4
Of course. You're right.

Speaker 15
Mother? Have you decided yet?

Speaker 14
If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl, I'll name the baby, Rei.

Speaker 15
Shinji, Rei,

Speaker 16
good names. Mother.

Speaker 7
Shinji? Shinji!

Speaker 10
Well, Unit 1's restoration ought to be finished by the day after tomorrow. So even when they're given divine power, human beings still treat it as a matter of fact. I can hardly agree with that. Speaking of which, the committee is looking at freezing the Evas.

Speaker 2
The Evangelion androids. They may be man-made, but who knows what lurks inside that black box. Uh-huh. I'm just glad that Shinji's

Speaker 10
life was saved. No thanks to me. The credit probably goes to you. Hey, you want to go bar hopping tonight?

Speaker 2
Uh, sorry. I've got to go somewhere.

Speaker 10
See ya! Shinji's just been saved and she's already running to her lover? Well, I guess I can't blame her.

Speaker 2
Ritsuko must be thinking I'm pretty disgusting.

Speaker 4
Appearing to give in to our sexual desires makes for a more realistic appearance. A good deception.

Speaker 2
Deceive the intelligence department? Or the commander in Ritzko? Or me?

Speaker 4
No, no. I meant myself.

Speaker 2
You want to fool the others? You never show interest in others, but you want their attention. You really are just like my dad.

Speaker 4
I didn't know you still smoked.

Speaker 2
I only smoke after this sort of thing, so nobody knows but you. Here's smoke in your eyes.

Speaker 4
Really? I'm honored.

Speaker 2
And how's instrumentality going? Adam could wipe out mankind. Why is he being kept there?

Speaker 4
Did you come to see me just to learn that?

Speaker 2
Yeah. Well, actually, that's one of the reasons. It

Speaker 4
would be my honor to be used as my lady's cat's paw. But I can't.

Speaker 2
I just want you to know what I want. What are Nerve and Commander Ikari really planning?

Speaker 4
I'd like to know that myself.

Speaker 2
Hey, you can't dodge my questions by doing that. No, don't put strange things in there. What are you doing? I can't believe this. What?

Speaker 7
What is this?

Speaker 4
This is for you. The first time in eight years. And maybe the last as well.

piano plays softly Thank you.
