Speaker 1
The old man like a poor man, the young man, the story of the young man. The blue wind is now Even if you're in the door, you're smiling and smiling. It's so easy to touch, but I'm not sure how to reach. I don't know what you're still knowing. I don't know what to do. It's hard to see, right? The back of your back is a way to see the future. The hell of a god of the天使, I will soon fly away from the window. I will be able to fly with hot dogs, I will be afraid of the memories. I'm going to

Speaker 2
Retrieve it! Hurry!

Speaker 3
The target has gone silent! What's Shinji's status?

Speaker 2
He's alive!

Speaker 4
Unit 1 has been recovered. Send him to the 7th cage.

Speaker 2
I'm going to the cage. Take over for me, please.

Speaker 5
Unit 1 secured. The pilot's brainwaves are extremely erratic. His cardiac readings are very weak! Increase the power to the life support systems. Give him a heart massage. Roger. Heartbeat stabilized. Force eject the

Speaker 2
entry plug. Hurry! Emergency LCL discharge. Roger. Come on, open the hatch. Come on!

Speaker 6
*Bang

* *Evil*

Speaker 3
Its accelerated particle beam cannon has hit the balloon. The decoy's been vaporized.

Speaker 2
Next one.

Speaker 3
*Squeak* The Type 12 Mortar has been vaporized!

Speaker 2
Yeah, I see that.

Speaker 3
From the data we've collected, we're assuming

Speaker 7
the Angel automatically attacks any opponents that come within a certain range. Hmmm... that range will be targeted. It's too risky for close range combat in an Ava, isn't it?

Speaker 2
What's the status of its AT field?

Speaker 7
It's still active. It's strong enough that the spatial changes in phase are visible. And needless to say, using conventional means of attack, guided missiles, artillery, and bombs would inflict more damage on us than on the Angel.

Speaker 2
Yeah,

Speaker 7
offensively

Speaker 2
and defensively, it's almost perfect. A real flying fortress. What's the Angel's current location?

Speaker 8
At this moment, the target is directly above us, penetrating the Tokyo-3 null zone. A giant shield with a diameter of 17.5 meters

Speaker 7
is boring towards Nerve HQ. That's it then. It appears the enemy is going to attack Nerve headquarters directly.

Speaker 2
Sassy bastard! What's its estimated time of arrival?

Speaker 7
6 minutes, 54 seconds AM,

Speaker 8
just after midnight. By that time, it will have breached all 22 levels of defense armor, and will penetrate headquarters itself.

Speaker 2
Less than 10 hours.

Speaker 3
The shield has contacted the first armor plate.

Speaker 9
What kind of condition is Unit 1 in? Well, Unit 1's defensive armor was melted down to the third layer. But the good news is that the central control unit sustained no damage. Given three more seconds, it would have

Speaker 4
shot right through the

Speaker 7
Ava. It'll take three hours to install replacement parts.

Speaker 4
Understood. What's Unit Zero's status? The reactivation of Unit Zero shouldn't prove a problem, but there's still a feedback error remaining. So it wouldn't... Survive combat. What's the

Speaker 2
condition of Unit One's pilot?

Speaker 7
No physical damage. However, nerve pulses are up by 0.8. That's still within the acceptable limits.

Speaker 3
Enemy arrival, 9 hours, 55 minutes.

Speaker 2
Talk about high-pressure situations.

Speaker 7
Why don't we raise a white flag?

Speaker 2
Before we do that, there's just one more little thing that I'd like to try.

Speaker 3
You want to use a sniper to shoot the target from outside its firing zone?

Speaker 2
Yes, sir. Instead of trying to neutralize the target's AT field, I believe a pinpoint shot with a focused high-energy beam is the only way.

Speaker 5
What do the Magi say? The

Speaker 2
responses from the Magi supercomputers were two affirmative and one conditional affirmative.

Speaker 5
Our probability of success is

Speaker 7
8.7%.

Speaker 2
It's the highest value we could get. I

Speaker 7
see no reason to reject your plan. You may proceed, Captain Katsuraki.

Speaker 9
Yes, sir. You know how crazy this whole operation is, don't you? Operations Director Katsuraki. Don't

Speaker 2
be rude. It's not crazy. It can be done within nine hours and has the highest chance of success.

Speaker 9
It does? Really? But our positron rifle can't handle such a high output. What are you going to do about

Speaker 2
that? If ours won't work, we'll borrow one.

Speaker 9
We'll borrow one?

Speaker 2
You don't mean... Yeah, the SSDF's new prototype. I've come on behalf of NERV to hereby requisition the prototype self-propelled positron cannon as of 1500 hours today.

Speaker 10
But this is just... so ridiculous!

Speaker 2
We'll do our best to return this in as close to its original condition as we can. Thank you for your cooperation. Have a nice day. It's all yours, Ray! Take it away! What the? Be careful, that's a piece of precision machinery! Can I believe

Speaker 10
this? I cannot believe this.

Speaker 7
But ma'am, our latest calculations show that it'll take at least 180 million kilowatts to penetrate that Angel's AT field. Just where exactly are you planning on getting that much electricity?

Speaker 2
Where do you think I'll get it? All over Japan! We apologize for interrupting our regular programming for this emergency bulletin. From 11.30pm tonight until tomorrow morning, there will be a large-scale power blackout throughout most of Japan. We

Speaker 11
appreciate your cooperation. Repeat, from 11.30pm tonight until tomorrow morning, there will be a large-scale power blackout throughout most of Japan. We appreciate your cooperation. *Bell rings*

*Bell rings* *Bell rings*

Speaker 10
The shield

Speaker 11
has just broken

Speaker 2
through the seventh defensive layer. What's the status on the energy supply system?

Speaker 7
Um, we're running about 3.2% behind schedule, but we should be finished by 2310.

Speaker 2
And the positron rifle?

Speaker 7
For the honor of Technology Development Department Section 3,

Speaker 8
we bet that we'll have it built in 3 hours!

Speaker 9
And how's our defense coming? Well, a shield is about the best we can come up with. So, is this the shield? Yes, it was sort of part of the space shuttle. It may look ugly, but it's got an electromagnetic base coating that Section 2 guarantees will stand up to the enemy's particle beam for at least 17 seconds. Pretty impressive, huh? Good work, Ritsuko.

Speaker 2
What about the sniper position?

Speaker 7
Taking geographical features and access to power transformers into consideration, this is our best choice.

Speaker 2
Right, everything's looking good. Our sniper will attack from the top of Mount Futago. We will commence at zero hours tomorrow morning. From this point on, this operation is called Operation Yashima!

Speaker 10
Roger.

Speaker 2
Now the only remaining problem is the pilot.

Speaker 12
Unit 1's pilot is conscious now. His examination results look normal.

Speaker 2
Good. Then the operation will proceed as planned.

Speaker 12
Roger.

Speaker 2
But I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

Speaker 12
Let's

Speaker 2
get to Mt. Vuntago now!

*phone rings* *cough*

Speaker 13
*phone

Speaker 13
rings* Ayanami. Pilot Ikari, I've been sent here to brief you on the Operation Yashima timetables. The operation will begin at midnight zero hundred hours. Prior to that, pilots Ikari and Aionami will arrive at the cage by 17:30. At 1800, Unit 1 and Unit 0 will activate. At 18:05, both units will be deployed. They will arrive at the temporary base at Mount Futago at 18:30. There, they will await further orders. Here, this is a new one. Oh? Don't show up looking like that, Pilot

Speaker 14
Ikari. Oh... Oh! Sorry. I've been apologizing since yesterday. Your meal.

Speaker 13
I don't feel like eating anything. We will be departing in 60 minutes.

Speaker 14
Do I really have to pilot Ava again? Yes, you do. I don't want to! You can be so cool about it because you haven't had the kind of experiences I've had yet. I don't want to go through it again! Then you can just stay here

Speaker 13
in bed. What do you mean by that? I will pilot Eva Unit 1. Dr. Okagi is already prepared to rewrite the personal data files for Unit 1. Ritsuko is? Captain Katsuragi and Dr. Okagi will be waiting for me in the cage. Hey! Goodbye.

Speaker 7
*Sigh* They're really late.

Speaker 3
We ought to evacuate to the shelter. No way! I hacked into my dad's data files! I'm absolutely sure this is the time it's said. Well, okay then. Where in the heck are they? Oh! The entire mountain is moving! There they are! The Evangelions!

Speaker 9
Totally awesome!

Speaker 6
Go

Speaker 10
for it, Evangelions! We believe in you! Go, we believe in you! Yeah! Go Evangelion! Yeah!

Speaker 3
The shield has penetrated through the 17th layer of armor. It will reach headquarters in 3 hours, 55 minutes.

Speaker 7
Power supply stations from Shikoko and Kyosho areas completed.

Speaker 2
Beginning test of each cooling system.

Speaker 9
That's a very delicate piece of machinery. Handle it carefully. This thing wasn't built for field operations. Will it really work? Point taken, but we have no choice. This was the most expedient way of achieving our goal. Are you sure it's safe to use? Theoretically, yes. However, we're not sure if the cannon barrel and accelerator will be able to handle the stress or not. This is the first time it's ever been fired with such a high power output behind it. Listen up. Here are the battle plans for the operation. Shinji. Yes? Your Unit 1 will be the gunner. Right. Rei, you will cover him with Unit 0. Yes. The reason for this arrangement is because Shinji has a higher sync ratio with Unit 1, and this operation will require an exceptionally high degree of precision. Since the positron beam will be influenced by the Earth's gravity, magnetic fields, and rotation, it will not fire in a straight line. You must remember to adjust for these deviations. You must penetrate the core precisely. But Ritsuka, I've never practiced with this before. Don't worry. Just do what the manual says. As soon as the indicators in the center converge, just pull the trigger. The computers will handle the rest. Also, be aware that before you can fire the rifle a second time, you will first have to wait for the unit to cool, then replace the fuses and reload. You've got to hit it the first time. What if I miss? Or the enemy shoots back? Shinji, don't even think about something like that. You've got to destroy the Angel with your first shot.

Speaker 14
So I have no choice.

Speaker 13
I... I'm just to defend Unit 1, is that correct? Yes. Understood.

Speaker 2
It's time. Get geared up. Right.

Speaker 14
Maybe this will be our last day alive. Why would you say something like that?

Speaker 13
You won't die. I'll be protecting you.

Speaker 14
*music* Ayanami, just why do you pilot this thing? Because I'm bonded to it. You're bonded?

Speaker 13
Yes. It's a

Speaker 14
bond. You mean to my father? To all people. You're very strong, Rei. I have nothing else. What do you mean you have nothing else? It's time.

Speaker 13
Let's go. Goodbye, Shinji.

Speaker 11
The time is approaching zero hundred hours.

Speaker 7
Commencing operation.

Speaker 2
Listen, Shinji. We're entrusting you with the energy of the entire nation of Japan. I'm counting on you.

Speaker 7
Roger.

Speaker 2
Initiate primary connection. Do it!

Speaker 7
Initiating power transmission from districts numbers 1 through 803.

Speaker 11

Speaker 10
Three, two, one! Fire now!

Speaker 3
*Evil Scream The shield has broken into the geo front.

Speaker 5
- Hurry, second shot. - Replacing fuses, initiating recharge. - Barrel cooling in progress. - We've got another high energy reading building inside the target.

Speaker 4
- Not now. - Ah! - Look

Speaker 6
out,

Speaker 2
Shinji! - Ah!

Speaker 10
- Oh!

Speaker 5
- Ayunami! The shield can't last long! Are we ready? 10 more seconds! Arrgh! Hurry up!

Speaker 10
Hurry up! Arrgh! Yeah! We made

Speaker 2
it!

Speaker 10
Ayanami! *Gunshot Ayanami! Are you alright? Ayanami!

Speaker 14
Don't ever say that. Just don't say that you have nothing else. Just don't say that. And don't say goodbye when you leave on a mission. It's just too sad. *crying* Why don't you just try smiling?

Speaker 10
Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars Let me see where spring is like going Jupiter and Mars In other words, hold my hand

Speaker 10
In other words, do me, kiss me Feel my heart with sound and let me sing forevermore You are all I long for, though I won't supernate all In other worlds, please be true. In other
