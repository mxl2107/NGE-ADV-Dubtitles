Speaker 1
The young man I just saw you just look at The world's

Speaker 2
*Ejects* It's not working! Unit 1's interlock circuit has been cut off!

Speaker 3
What about the eject signal?

Speaker 2
All codes are being blocked from inside the plug! It's not being accepted!

Speaker 3
Look! Shinji, if we hadn't taken over, you would have been killed!

Speaker 2
That's not the

Speaker 4
point.

Speaker 3
Maybe, but it's the truth!

Speaker 4
Stop pushing me, dammit! Don't push me anymore! Unit 1 has 185 seconds of power left. That's enough to destroy at least half of headquarters!

Speaker 5
He'll do it too, the way he is right now.

Speaker 2
Shinji, will you listen to us? If the commander hadn't made the decision to engage the dummy plug, everyone here could have been killed! I said

Speaker 4
that's beside the point, damn you! My father tried to kill Toji, and he did it using my hands! That bastard!

Father! I know you're there! Say something! Answer me!

Speaker 5
Increase the entry plug's LCL pressure to its maximum level.

Speaker 6
What?

Speaker 5
I have no time to waste on a petulant child.

Speaker 4
I've still got a

Speaker 7
direct control circuit!

Speaker 2
Damn it. Damn you. How

Speaker 8
are you? I'm not hurt enough to stop doing my job. I couldn't lie in bed during an emergency like this. So what did they end up doing with Shinji? It's my understanding that they had to

Speaker 6
cut the

Speaker 8
escape hatch open

Speaker 9
with a laser cutter and remove him forcibly.

Speaker 10
This sucks. I'm afraid that this time... He's really finished. He can't talk his way out of this. Idiot. Is he alright? He wasn't injured, if that's what you mean. He's probably imagining that it was all a dream. A dream? Yeah. Don't tell me you don't dream either.

Speaker 4
Shinji, why is he in the hospital there next to me? Is this the same hospital where my sister is? Shhh. Shhh. Shinji and Ayanami?

Speaker 9
Ikari, why did you do that?

Speaker 4
Because I couldn't trust him. My father betrayed me, Rei. Even though I was finally able to talk to him, he still doesn't understand me... at all.

Speaker 9
Did you try to understand him? His feelings?

Speaker 4
I used to try.

Speaker 9
Why don't you try to understand him?

Speaker 4
I SAID I DID!

Speaker 9
You're running away from the truth because it's ugly?

Speaker 7
Why not?! What's wrong with running away from reality if it sucks?!

Speaker 4
This

Speaker 1
is weird. What are those two arguing about?

Speaker 8
This is by special permission. You've got exactly five minutes. Thank you.

Speaker 6
Hey,

Speaker 11
it's the class rep.

Speaker 9
Tizuhara, how are you feeling?

Speaker 11
Lousy, but at least I'm

Speaker 3
still alive. That's strange. I thought Shinji was here. Was that just a dream?

Speaker 9
They took him out of here yesterday. You slept for three days, Toji.

Speaker 1
I did? Three days? Did you? No,

Speaker 9
I've only been here a little while. They wouldn't let me. I mean, I came as the class representative, you know.

Speaker 3
Of course, I know that.

Speaker 9
Do you really?

Speaker 4
I'm sorry. I didn't get to eat the lunch you made.

Speaker 9
Don't worry about it. It's alright. Just wish I could bring you a lunch here, but it's not allowed.

Speaker 4
Uh, Srep, would you do me a favor? Uh-huh. Would you tell my sister that there's nothing wrong with me? Shinji Akari, Commander wants to see you.

Speaker 5
Disobeying orders. Using an Eva for personal vendettas. Childish intimidation. These are all criminal offenses. Do you have anything to say?

Speaker 4
Yes. I don't want to pilot an Ava anymore. And I don't want to stay here either.

Speaker 5
Well then, you may leave.

Speaker 4
Yes. I'll go back to my old teacher.

Speaker 5
So, you're running away again? You disappoint me. I assume that we will never meet again.

Speaker 4
Yes. That's my intent.

Speaker 5
This is me. Erase the third child's ren. Ray will become Unit 1's designated pilot, with the dummy plug as backup.

*phone rings* *phone rings*

*phone rings*

*phone rings*

Speaker 4
Hey! Shinji! Can you hear me? Is it true that you're leaving? It is true, isn't it? But why? Why are you running away again? I admired you! I envied you! You're different from us! Damn! Even Toji became a pilot! - I don't think Asuka will be coming. She must be pretty disgusted with me.

Speaker 8
- Yes, she didn't even ask me to say goodbye to you.

Speaker 4
- That sounds like her. That's good.

Speaker 8
- It's going to be hard if you keep hiding your anger like that.

Speaker 4
- That's your philosophy, Misato. I can't live the way you do.

Speaker 8
- As I'm sure you may. - I'm sure you may. You know there will be a lot of restrictions placed upon your activities from now on.

Speaker 4
Yes, I know that, but--

Speaker 8
Yes?

Speaker 6
Let

Speaker 8
me ask

Speaker 4
you one thing. Why was Toji chosen to be the fourth child?

Speaker 8
It would seem that all of the students that are in your class are fourth-level candidates, Shinji. I just found out myself that it was yet another elaborate fabrication.

Speaker 4
All of them?

Speaker 8
All of my classmates? Shinji, about Suzuhara. That was a mistake that can't be mended with words alone. But I have to be honest with you. I was projecting all of my dreams, hopes, and purpose onto you. I know that it's been a huge burden for you, but we-- and by that, I mean everyone at Nerve-- have had no choice except to place our future in your hands. I want you to remember that.

Speaker 4
The end justifies the means?

Speaker 8
Yes, that's how it is. And another thing-- I'll be leaving your passcode to headquarters and your room as they are.

Speaker 4
What's the point? Get rid of them. It's over now. I won't pilot that thing.

Speaker 8
This is the real Shinji talking. I've never heard him sound so certain about anything before.

Speaker 12
A special state of emergency has been declared for the Tokai region. All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately. A special state of emergency has been declared for the Tokai region. An angel?

Speaker 13
All personnel, go to first stage battle stations. Prepare for ground-to-air intercept.

Speaker 6
Target status!

Speaker 9
It's broken through

Speaker 6
our perimeter! The Kamagataki defense line has been shattered!

Speaker 8
The first 18 layers of armor have been breached! I don't believe it. 18 layers destroyed in one shot. The AVAs can't deploy fast enough to intercept up top. Position Unit 2 for combat inside the geo-front, directly in front of headquarters. ASCA will snipe the target as soon as it breaks into the geo-front.

Speaker 2
Zero status? Unit 0 is in the AT Field Neutralization Zone, Major. But the left arm still hasn't been regenerated. Then it's not ready for

Speaker 5
combat yet. Send Ray out in Unit 1. Prepare a dummy plug as the backup system.

Speaker 8
Right. Initiating entry. Charging LCL. Commencing A10 nerve connection. The pulse

Speaker 2
flow is reversing! Unit 1's refusing the neural connection!

Speaker 6
Is that possible?

Speaker 5
Ikari? Yes. Is it refusing me? Abort the activation. Send Ray out an AVA Unit 0. Reactivate Unit 1 with the dummy plug.

Speaker 8
But Unit Zero isn't ready! It's not a problem. I can go. Rey? If I die, I can be

Speaker 4
replaced. I made up my mind. I swore I'd never pilot that thing.

Speaker 1
Hey, you there! What are you doing? Get in the shelter, quickly!

Speaker 3
It's no use! One more hand in the armor will be completely destroyed!

Speaker 8
I'm counting on you, Asuka.

Speaker 10
Here it comes. I can beat this angel even without Shinji the hero here to help out.

Speaker 9
Damn you!

Speaker 6
Shite!

Speaker 13
Next!

Speaker 6
I'm

Speaker 13
neutralized against AT Field, aren't I? Why won't you collapse, damn you! This can't be happening, I can't lose again, not again!

Speaker 6
My god!

Speaker 11
- Adopt a train hunt! - Alaska, no! Disengage your nerve connections now!

Speaker 10
- Evacuation training? What are you, stupid? That stuff's not for pilots like us.

Speaker 11
- Direct hit on the eighth block. Abandon the sixth shelter. All

Speaker 6
survivors

Speaker 11
go to the third shelter.

Speaker 3
- Unit two is severely damaged. It can't continue combat. How's Asuka?

Speaker 8
She's alive! Verdumpt!

Speaker 3
The Angel has started moving again!

Speaker 8
What's Unit 1's status? Dummy plug

Speaker 2
upload completed. Call insertion completed.

Speaker 8
Initiate contact. Roger! What?! The pulse has vanished! It's refusing the

Speaker 2
dummy plug! Unit 1 won't activate! The dummy and

Speaker 5
Ray... Were both refused. Fyutsuki, take the con.

Speaker 4
Evacuate the casualties to the 6th block! Uninjured! Go to the 3rd shelter!

Speaker 1
Hey! This way! Hey, what are you doing? Do you wanna die?

Speaker 3
Asuka... Hey, Shinji!

Speaker 4
Kaji? What are you doing here?

Speaker 3
That's my line. What are you doing here, Shinji? I...

Speaker 4
I decided that I'd never pilot an Ava again. And since I decided that...

Speaker 3
Oh, really? Well, to answer your question, since my other job became public knowledge, I'm off the combat roster. So, here I am, sprinkling. At

Speaker 4
a time like this?

Speaker 3
What better time? Although I'd rather be between Misato's melons, this is a place I'd like to be when I die.

Speaker 4
Die?

Speaker 3
That's right. It is said that if an angel comes into contact with Adam, who lies sleeping beneath this very ground, humanity will be eradicated in the third impact. The only thing that can stop this is the one thing that has power equal to an angel's. Evangelion.

Speaker 4
Ayanami, with no rifle! It's an N2

Speaker 8
mine! Ray! AT Field, full power.

Speaker 6
Unit zero. Rei! Oh dear god.

Speaker 3
Shinji, the only thing I can do is stand here in water. But you, you have something that you can do. That only you can do. Nobody is forcing you. Think for yourself and make that decision by yourself. Think about what you have to do now. Think about no longer having any regrets. *Sounds

Speaker 5
of process from step 108.

Speaker 7
Let me pilot it! Please, let me pilot Unit 1!

Speaker 5
Father… Why are you here?

Speaker 4
I'm here because I'm the pilot of Evangelion Unit 1,

Speaker 7
Shinji Ikari! We've been breached! Target is inside the main shaft! It's advancing! Where is it heading? It's advancing directly towards Central Dogma! It's

Speaker 8
coming

Speaker 6
here!

Speaker 8
All personnel evacuate!

Speaker 6
All personnel evacuate! Repeat, all personnel evacuate! Wait!

Speaker 8
Ava Unit 1? Shinji!

*Screams* No!

Speaker 1
- Please, I know! - Launch the fifth catapult! Check! *Mario screams* *Mario screams*

Speaker 6
*Mario

screams* *Mario screams*

Speaker 2
Huh? Energy reserve depleted! One is completely drained its reserves! The backup power supply isn't working! Shinji! Shinji!

Speaker 7
Shinji! Dammit, move! Move! Move! Come on, move, you goddamn piece of junk! Move now or there's no point to any of this, dammit!

Speaker 11
Huh? What's that?

Speaker 7
Move! Move! Move! Move! Come on! Move! Oh, God! You've got to move now! Everyone will be killed! God, I'm sick of it already! Come on move! God damn you, you filthy stinky buster!

Speaker 2
It's... it's reactivated.

Speaker 8
Oh my god!

Speaker 2
This is impossible. It must be wrong. How can Shinji's sync ratio with Unit 1 be over 400%?! It's finally happened.

Speaker 9
It's aware. Oh!

Speaker 6
*Sigh* It's breaking

Speaker 13
free! Free of what? Those plates weren't just armor. They were also restraints.

Speaker 7
Those bindings allowed us to control it. But now the Ava is removing the web that binds it to our will. The beast inside the Ava is free at last!

Speaker 3
Unit 1's awakened and been set free. Zele sure won't stay quiet for this. Was this part of your scenario, Commander Ikari? It's begun at last. Indeed. This is the beginning. Oh!

Speaker 11
In other words, the rain is big Fill my home with song and let me sing forevermore

Speaker 11
For all our love, for all our love In other worlds, please be true. In other worlds, I

Speaker 8
love you. Fused with another existence, what will Shinji see? Meanwhile, everyone who was left behind tries desperately to rescue him, but the attempt fails. It's the next episode. Form of the mind, form of the man.
