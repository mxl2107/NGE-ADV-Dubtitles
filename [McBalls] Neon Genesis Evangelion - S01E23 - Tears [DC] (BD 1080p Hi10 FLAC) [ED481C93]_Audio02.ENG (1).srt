1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 1: The young man

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Speaker 1: I just saw you just look at me

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,140
Speaker 1: I'm smiling at you

4
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,940
Speaker 1: I'm so happy to touch my heart

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,400
Speaker 1: I'm just curious to see you

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,180
Speaker 1: I'm still not aware of my heart

7
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,140
Speaker 1: I'm still not aware of my heart

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,000
Speaker 1: But I'll never forget

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Speaker 1: The back of the back of the

10
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,100
Speaker 1: I will be a little

11
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,220
Speaker 2: more

12
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
Don't hesitate. Move ahead.

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,000
If I can see you again, I will say...

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,320
Speaker 2: the words that I could not say eight years ago.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,540
Speaker 2: Bye.

16
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,340
Speaker 3: Another phone that will never ring.

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,740
Speaker 4: Misato's shutting herself off again, as usual.

18
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,540
Speaker 4: Is Asuka going to come back today?

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,880
Speaker 5: She skipped school.

20
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,400
Speaker 5: She won't go home.

21
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
Speaker 5: All she does is play those games.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,740
Speaker 5: Hikari?

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,900
Speaker 5: Uh, yes?

24
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,520
Speaker 6: Can I sleep here?

25
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,060
Speaker 6: Yeah.

26
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Speaker 6: I'm sorry I'm inconveniencing you.

27
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,420
Speaker 6: You're not inconvenient.

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,320
Speaker 6: When I didn't win with my Ava, I lost whatever value I might have had.

29
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 6: I hate. I hate. I hate everything.

30
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,920
Speaker 6: And I hate myself the most.

31
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,280
Speaker 6: I don't care about anything anymore.

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,360
Speaker 6: There's no point.

33
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,200
Speaker 5: There's nothing to be ashamed of, Oscar.

34
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,040
Speaker 5: You did the best you could. You should be proud.

35
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,120
Speaker 5: I'm not a child.

36
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Speaker 7: So that child is gone.

37
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,320
Speaker 7: Yes, even cats die.

38
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,280
Speaker 7: Don't cry, Grandma.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,420
Speaker 7: Yes, I'll come home as soon as I have time.

40
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,420
Speaker 7: I haven't visited Mother's grave in three years.

41
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,600
Speaker 7: Yes, I'll call you next time.

42
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,360
Speaker 7: Yeah, so even cats can die.

43
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Speaker 8: It is impossible to retrieve the Lanch of Longiners now.

44
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,260
Speaker 8: Why did you use it?

45
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,400
Speaker 8: And what about the Ava series? We don't have them all scheduled yet.

46
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,360
Speaker 9: Destroying the Angels was our top priority.

47
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,840
Speaker 9: There was no other way.

48
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,420
Speaker 9: No other

49
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,960
Speaker 8: way?

50
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,240
Speaker 8: You'd better come up with a more believable excuse.

51
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,920
Speaker 9: Your actions these days belie a lack of respect for this committee.

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,820
Speaker 9: Fyutski, I'm in conference.

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,900
Speaker 9: Understood.

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 9: Another Angel is approaching.

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,820
Speaker 9: We must finish this later.

56
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,980
Speaker 8: You're assuming you'll still have a seat here?

57
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,860
Speaker 8: Are you going to betray us, Ikari?

58
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,380
Speaker 3: I'll be there in 15 minutes. Sort a Unit Zero through the 32nd gate. Use Unit Two as the backup.

59
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,140
Speaker 3: No, I'm sorry. I don't have the authority to cancel the Commander's freeze on Unit One.

60
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,920
Speaker 3: That's right. Bye.

61
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,900
Speaker 3: It's another Angel, alright.

62
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,180
Speaker 10: Damn.

63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,780
Unit Zero has launched. Advancing to intercept.

64
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,300
Speaker 9: Unit Two, remain in the launch bay.

65
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,580
Speaker 9: No. Move it out, sir.

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:39,680
Speaker 9: What?

67
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,300
Speaker 9: No arguments. It might be useful as a decoy at least.

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,620
Speaker 9: Right.

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,080
Speaker 9: Ava Unit 2 ready to launch.

70
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
Speaker 6: Here I am in this seat again.

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,340
Speaker 6: Am I even linked to this thing anymore?

72
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,620
Speaker 6: Unit 2, advance

73
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,420
to the 8th gate.

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,180
Stand ready to move out as soon as your launch position is determined.

75
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,900
Speaker 6: Even if I go, I'll just be a burden on the others.

76
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,780
Speaker 11: Target approaching. It's past the final intercept line at Gora.

77
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,600
Speaker 6: I just don't care anymore.

78
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,820
Speaker 11: The target is above the Wakidani Valley,

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,360
rotating in a fixed position.

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Speaker 3: Target's AT field is still active.

81
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,700
Speaker 3: Where have you been?

82
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,400
Speaker 3: I'm sorry, no excuse.

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,380
Speaker 3: Status report!

84
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:25,800
Speaker 3: It

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,520
Speaker 9: looks like we're in a stalemate, Major.

86
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,260
Speaker 9: He's right.

87
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,360
Speaker 9: The target's field pattern keeps cycling

88
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,180
Speaker 7: from blue to orange!

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,160
Speaker 7: What's that mean?

90
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,440
Speaker 7: The Magi aren't able to answer that question yet!

91
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,260
Speaker 9: We just don't have enough solid data right now.

92
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 7: However, I'm certain that it's capable of assuming forms

93
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,560
Speaker 7: besides the one we see now.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,120
Speaker 7: So we can't attack first.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,880
Speaker 12: Ray, let's hold back and study it for a bit.

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,740
Speaker 12: No,

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,440
Speaker 5: it's coming.

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,140
- Ray, efface of action!

99
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,960
Speaker 9: - She can't!

100
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,520
Speaker 5: There's not enough

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:54,960
time!

102
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Speaker 9: Contamination! The target's affecting Unit Zero!

103
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,660
Speaker 7: What's

104
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,400
Speaker 12: the status on Unit Zero's AT field?

105
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,160
Speaker 12: The field's up, but it's not stopping the Angel's probe!

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,700
Speaker 7: Is the Angel trying to establish first level contact with Unit Zero?

107
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,940
Speaker 7: It must be.

108
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,000
Speaker 7: We've got biocontamination invading Unit Zero!

109
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,780
Speaker 7: Ava Unit 2, roll out! Take some of that

110
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,600
Speaker 10: heat off of Ray!

111
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,440
Speaker 3: *Biofusion

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
Speaker 12: *

113
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,960
Speaker 13: It's sink! Her sink ratio's under 10%!

114
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,820
Speaker 13: Asuka!

115
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,260
Speaker 3: It just won't move!

116
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,260
Speaker 3: It won't move?

117
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,460
Speaker 3: She's just the target sitting out there! Get her back! Do it now!

118
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,600
Speaker 5: Who is this?

119
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,200
Speaker 5: You. Myself. And an Ava?

120
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,460
Speaker 5: No, I sense somebody other than myself.

121
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,539
Speaker 5: Who are you?

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,560
Speaker 5: An angel.

123
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,919
Speaker 5: Are you one of the beings we call the angels?

124
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,240
Speaker 5: Don't you want to become one with me?

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,200
Speaker 5: No, I am me, not you.

126
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,760
Speaker 5: Hmm, but you shall.

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,580
Speaker 5: It's too late.

128
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
Speaker 5: I will share part of my mind with you.

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Speaker 5: Let me share with you these emotions.

130
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,220
Speaker 5: This is pain.

131
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,220
Speaker 5: Yes.

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,860
Speaker 5: Do you feel this

133
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,200
Speaker 11: pain?

134
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Speaker 11: This pain?

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,660
Speaker 11: No, it's different.

136
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,180
*music*

137
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,820
You are that sorrowful.

138
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,000
Speaker 5: Is this a tear?

139
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,660
Am I the one crying?

140
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,740
Speaker 9: Ray!

141
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,260
Speaker 9: I want Evangelion Unit 1 taken out of cryostasis.

142
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,500
Speaker 9: Launch it immediately.

143
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,440
Speaker 9: What?

144
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,040
Speaker 9: I said launch it!

145
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,260
Speaker 6: Yes, sir.

146
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,800
Speaker 6: Why for her?

147
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,560
Speaker 6: Am I so worthless you couldn't do this for me?

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
Speaker 3: Spread your AT field to full!

149
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,940
Speaker 3: Get way out of there now!

150
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:11,840
Speaker 14: Right!

151
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,700
Speaker 5: Shikari!

152
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,020
Speaker 3: Shinji! You've got to use your progressive knife!

153
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,500
Speaker 3: *Gunshot*

154
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,560
*Screaming*

155
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,760
*Screaming*

156
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,880
You are Akari!

157
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Speaker 5: This is my mind and soul, to become one with Akari.

158
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,920
Speaker 5: *Gunshot*

159
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,580
Speaker 5: You will not!

160
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,320
Speaker 5: Her AT field's

161
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,800
Speaker 10: been reversed!

162
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,660
Speaker 10: She's got biocontamination everywhere!

163
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,160
Speaker 13: She's trying to contain the angel!

164
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,140
-

165
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,240
Speaker 12: -Her field is at its limit. Her core won't be able to hold at this rate. -Rey abandon

166
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,900
Speaker 5: unit zero!

167
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:25,840
Speaker 5: -I cannot. If I leave unit zero the AT field will cease to be. I will not let it.

168
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,980
Speaker 5: -Rey, don't do

169
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,180
Speaker 10: it.

170
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,540
*Gunshot*

171
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,260
Speaker 14: The targets

172
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,300
Speaker 12: disappeared.

173
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,060
Speaker 12: This operation is over.

174
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,720
Speaker 12: Downgrade alert status to condition yellow.

175
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,040
Speaker 9: Roger. Shifting alert status to condition yellow.

176
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,300
Speaker 3: What's the status of Unit Zero?

177
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,220
Speaker 3: I don't think the entry plug ejected.

178
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,600
Speaker 3: So now to rescue team.

179
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,020
Speaker 7: If there's anything left to rescue...

180
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,300
No antibiotic substances from the 16th Angel have been located as of yet.

181
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,480
Speaker 2: We'll continue to search.

182
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,580
Speaker 7: The traces of Level C spread out to the southwest.

183
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,320
Speaker 2: Dr. Akagi, we've located the plug!

184
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,960
Speaker 9: Dr.

185
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,160
Speaker 7: Akagi...

186
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,700
Speaker 7: Here is top secret. Clean out the plug and destroy everything.

187
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,440
Speaker 7: Understood. Do it now!

188
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,380
Speaker 8: At last, we have defeated all of the Angels up to the Sixteen.

189
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,780
Speaker 8: Now there is only one left.

190
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,560
Speaker 8: As it is written in Xela's Dead Sea Scrolls.

191
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,900
Speaker 8: Promised time is at hand. The road has been long and the sacrifices have been great.

192
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,240
Speaker 8: True. We have lost the Lance of Longinus. And now Unit Zero.

193
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,040
Speaker 8: That is sufficient reason for

194
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,000
Speaker 1: removing Ikari.

195
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,580
Speaker 8: Surely he must have understood what release of Fielitski

196
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,760
Speaker 11: meant.

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,920
Speaker 8: We shall have to find another Katspor to use against Ikari.

198
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
Speaker 8: And this one must know the truth.

199
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,220
*Bell rings

200
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:17,260
Speaker 4: Misato, I can't cry anymore.

201
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,420
Speaker 4: I feel the pain, but the tears won't come.

202
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,560
Speaker 4: Why is that?

203
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,300
Speaker 4: Shinji,

204
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,280
Speaker 12: I don't know what to do or say.

205
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,000
Speaker 12: All I can do is be here for you.

206
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,060
Speaker 12: Don't

207
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,480
Speaker 4: touch me!

208
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
Speaker 4: Just leave me alone, Misato.

209
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,200
Speaker 4: I'm sorry.

210
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,020
Speaker 3: I know how lonely he must be.

211
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,540
Speaker 12: Does the fact that I'm a woman frighten him?

212
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,040
Speaker 12: Or is he afraid of getting close to anyone?

213
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Speaker 3: Pen-pen, come here.

214
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,700
Speaker 12: It's true.

215
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,680
Speaker 3: Anything is better than being alone.

216
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,800
Speaker 3: And I'm the one who's lonely.

217
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 15: Ray, the product of my despair,

218
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,400
Speaker 15: and yet at the same time, the vessel of your hope.

219
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,240
Speaker 15: In the end, I suppose it was unreasonable to expect to forget.

220
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,740
Speaker 12: Hello?

221
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,100
Speaker 12: Yes? What?

222
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,280
Speaker 12: Shiji!

223
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,100
Dr. Godai, internal medicine one.

224
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,440
Speaker 13: Dr. Goddai, please call conference room two immediately.

225
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,240
Speaker 14: Ray!

226
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,980
Speaker 14: I'm so glad.

227
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,140
Speaker 14: I can't believe you're alive.

228
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,040
Speaker 14: Why isn't my father here?

229
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,840
Speaker 14: Um, I...

230
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,940
Speaker 14: Thanks for saving my life.

231
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,140
Speaker 5: For doing what?

232
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,580
Speaker 14: You saved me.

233
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,760
Speaker 14: By sacrificing Unit Zero.

234
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,760
Speaker 5: Oh, did I save you?

235
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,920
Speaker 14: Don't you remember?

236
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,920
Speaker 5: I just don't know.

237
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,060
Speaker 5: I think I must be the third one.

238
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,380
Speaker 5: *BOOM*

239
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
Speaker 9: *Clocking*

240
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,000
Speaker 9: is likely to cause a great deal of trouble with Chairman Keel.

241
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,220
Speaker 9: I've given the old men of Sele something else to look at.

242
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,560
Speaker 9: There is no problem.

243
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,140
Speaker 9: It is our intent to carry

244
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,260
Speaker 8: out this Inquisition

245
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,160
Speaker 9: in a dignified

246
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,600
Speaker 8: manner.

247
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,240
Speaker 8: It is not our intent to bring any shame upon you.

248
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,700
Speaker 7: I don't feel any shame.

249
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,160
Speaker 8: She's a strong woman.

250
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,040
Speaker 8: I can see why Ikari wants to keep her next to him.

251
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,500
Speaker 8: However, were you aware that the one who sent you here

252
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,260
Speaker 11: was none other

253
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,380
Speaker 8: than Ikari himself?

254
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,840
Speaker 8: He refused our request for the pilot of Unit Zero and has sent you here in her stead, Dr. Akagi.

255
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,200
Speaker 7: He sent me instead of her?

256
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,180
Speaker 7: The way to the truth, which you wanted, was sent by

257
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,280
Speaker 16: 36 other methods.

258
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,400
Speaker 16: But they won't reach you. The only way that is guaranteed is this capsule.

259
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,080
Speaker 16: This is all I have. Now it's completely up to you as to how to use this.

260
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,060
Speaker 16: The passcode is our first memory.

261
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:15,640
Speaker 16: Goodbye.

262
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,320
Speaker 16: And take care.

263
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,680
Speaker 12: The silence from you no longer hurts as much as it once did.

264
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,920
Speaker 12: Not since you gave me your heart and soul.

265
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,740
Speaker 8: So, has Dr. Akagi's deposition proved acceptable?

266
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,460
Speaker 8: She is not like Fiutsuki.

267
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,820
Speaker 8: It is more beneficial for us to release her.

268
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,000
Speaker 8: The woman has rendered remarkable service to the Eva series.

269
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,900
Speaker 8: Let it continue to be of use for a while.

270
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,320
Speaker 9: For the future of mankind.

271
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,980
Speaker 8: As for the Evangelions themselves, there are now eight under

272
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,520
Speaker 9: construction.

273
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,620
Speaker 8: And four that are not.

274
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 8: The disappearance of Tokyo 3 will prove to be a boon to the project.

275
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,660
Speaker 8: We must accelerate the completion of that day.

276
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,800
Speaker 8: The promised time will be at hand.

277
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,160
Speaker 4: Hello?

278
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,920
Speaker 4: Listen

279
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,420
Speaker 7: to me carefully. For the next few minutes, you'll be free from the Secret Service.

280
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,840
Speaker 7: Come here now while you can.

281
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,460
Speaker 4: Rizko?

282
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,280
Speaker 3: Sorry, it won't work without my password.

283
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,220
Speaker 7: I see. Did Kaji arrange this?

284
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,360
Speaker 12: Show them to me. All the secrets you buried here.

285
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,160
Speaker 7: All right, but this one will see them as well.

286
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:41,960
Speaker 7: Agreed.

287
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,900
Speaker 14: This looks just like Rey's room.

288
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,080
Speaker 7: That's not surprising. This is the place where Rei was born.

289
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,260
Speaker 14: She was what?

290
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,900
Speaker 7: She was born here.

291
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,680
Speaker 7: The visions of light and water that stream through her consciousness are merely reflections of this place.

292
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,020
Speaker 12: Dr. Akagi, this isn't what I came to see.

293
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,400
Speaker 7: I

294
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,080
Speaker 12: know that,

295
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,960
Speaker 7: Misato.

296
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,380
Speaker 7: Is that... on Ava?

297
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,700
Speaker 7: The first one. A failure. We abandoned it ten years ago.

298
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,940
Speaker 4: A graveyard for Avis?

299
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,060
Speaker 7: Nothing that elaborate. Just a dumping ground.

300
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,200
Speaker 7: It's also the place where your mother was taken from you.

301
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,820
Speaker 7: You may not remember it, but you were watching at the very moment when your mother disappeared.

302
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,300
Speaker 7: Do you remember that, Shinji?

303
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,040
Speaker 7: Doctor!

304
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,920
Speaker 12: So, this is the core of a dummy plug?

305
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,940
Speaker 12: This is

306
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,840
Speaker 7: where we produce the

307
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,320
Speaker 14: components.

308
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,680
Oh my god, it's Rey.

309
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,660
Speaker 7: They're all Rey? You mean the dummy plugs are?

310
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 7: Uh-huh. These are the cores of the dummy plugs.

311
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,640
Speaker 7: They're what makes the system work.

312
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,600
Speaker 7: Who are they?

313
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,320
Speaker 7: These? These are empty vessels.

314
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,680
Speaker 7: Nothing but spare parts. Spare rays.

315
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,000
Speaker 7: Mankind found a god and man.

316
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,380
Speaker 7: in his folly, tried to make the god his toy.

317
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,760
Speaker 7: For that arrogance, mankind was punished.

318
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,800
Speaker 7: That happened 15 years ago,

319
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,240
Speaker 7: and the god that man found was lost.

320
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,240
Speaker 7: But man continues to attempt to resurrect the god,

321
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
Speaker 7: and from that god, Adam,

322
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,420
Speaker 7: man attempted to make a man who was like a god himself,

323
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,840
Speaker 7: and that was Ava.

324
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,640
Speaker 7: What? Avas are human?

325
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,320
Speaker 7: Yes.

326
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,280
Speaker 7: Yes. Inside the empty shell of each Eva is a human soul.

327
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,880
Speaker 7: But the only vessel which can hold a soul is Rey.

328
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,800
Speaker 7: These things are empty husks.

329
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,300
Speaker 7: They have no souls, no right to live.

330
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
Speaker 7: The room of Gav is empty.

331
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,980
Speaker 10: Stop this! Do you have any idea what you're doing?

332
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,380
Speaker 7: Yes, I know.

333
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,100
Speaker 7: I'm destroying them.

334
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,820
Speaker 13: These aren't human, just things with human forms

335
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,160
Speaker 13: But even so, I lost to these things

336
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,320
Speaker 13: To these soulless dolls

337
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:41,580
Speaker 13: I

338
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,200
couldn't win

339
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,740
Speaker 13: I could have suffered any humiliation

340
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,700
Speaker 13: Endured any torture

341
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,220
Speaker 13: But he had already chosen

342
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,160
Speaker 13: God, I'm a fool

343
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,880
Speaker 13: Like mother, like daughter

344
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,660
Speaker 13: Fools to the end

345
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,400
Speaker 13: If you want to kill me, go ahead and do it

346
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,140
Speaker 13: I'd welcome death

347
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,340
Speaker 7: If that's what you want,

348
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,520
Speaker 10: you are a fool.

349
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,040
Speaker 10: What is this curse

350
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,500
Speaker 12: that consumes all those who come into contact with Ava?

351
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
Speaker 12: *crying

352
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360
*

353
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,440
Speaker 10: Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars

354
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Speaker 10: Let me see where spring is like on Jupiter and us

355
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,640
Speaker 10: In other worlds, hold my hand

356
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,340
Speaker 10: In other words, duly kiss me

357
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Speaker 10: Fill my heart with song

358
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,300
Speaker 10: And let me sing forevermore

359
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,940
Speaker 10: You are all I love for

360
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,320
Speaker 10: All I love, sip and adore

361
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,680
Speaker 10: In other words, please

362
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,560
Speaker 10: Let's be true in other worlds.

363
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,240
I love you.

364
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,480
Speaker 12: The city that he had been protecting has disappeared.

365
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,620
Speaker 12: The friends that he was close to have gone.

366
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,060
Speaker 12: The girls that he had been drawn to have been consumed by fear.

367
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,980
Speaker 12: All of Shinji's emotional supports are gone.

368
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,020
Speaker 12: But now a new friend smiles upon him in the twilight.

369
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,640
Speaker 12: Shinji gives himself over to that smile,

370
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,760
Speaker 12: and it's as if all the sins that he has ever committed are gone.

371
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,840
Speaker 12: But fate has yet another cruel trick in store.

372
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,040
Speaker 12: Next episode, The Final Messenger.

373
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,020
you
