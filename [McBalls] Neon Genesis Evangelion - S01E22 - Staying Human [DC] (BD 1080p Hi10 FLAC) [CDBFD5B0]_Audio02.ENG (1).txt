Speaker 1
I guess we'll be in Japan by this time tomorrow. Misato said she'd pick me up by lunch. Oh, Misato's the person who was in Germany before Yukaji. I don't like her much, though. She's just so affected in the way she lives. So, I guess this'll be goodbye for a while. That's so boring.

Speaker 2
Oh,

Speaker 3
I'm sure you'll make lots of new boyfriends once you get to Japan, Asuka. And let's not forget that the third child is a boy, too.

Speaker 1
I'm not interested in children. You're the only one I love, Kashi.

Speaker 3
Well, that's quite an honor.

Speaker 1
I mean it, Kashi! If it's with you, then all of that stuff is totally okay! Kissing, and what's after that, even?

Speaker 3
Asuka, you're still a child. Those things can wait until you've grown up a little.

Speaker 1
Huh? But why? Can't you see that I've already grown enough? I am a grown up! Just look at me, Tony! Please, please!

Speaker 4
So the fiction has become the reality. How ironic that the experiment's advocate should become its victim. So, you believe that the contact experiment was the

Speaker 5
direct cause? You mean was the mental breakdown the result of the contact? Yes. Killing herself and leaving such a young girl behind is so awful. Perhaps, but I believe there may have been some additional causes.

Speaker 4
Asuka, darling, Mama cooked your favorite for you. Oh no, you mustn't complain about what you like and dislike, For that girl over there will laugh at you. She just sits there

Speaker 1
every day, talking to that doll as if it were her real daughter.

Speaker 6
I think it's because of the guilt she must feel. She devoted her entire life to her research, not to taking care of her own daughter.

Speaker 1
Oh, I feel your grief.

Speaker 6
It's like looking at porcelain figures of a mother and her child. Perhaps there really isn't much difference between humans and dolls.

Speaker 4
Mankind creates dolls in our own image. If God exists, perhaps we're all just a bunch of dolls to him.

Speaker 6
Hearing you say something like that makes it hard for me to believe that you're a modern physician.

Speaker 4
I may be a doctor, but I'm a human being. And a woman first.

Speaker 1
You're a strong girl, Oscar. But it's alright if you have to cry. I'll never cry, Grandmother. I have to take care of myself now. - Asuka,

Speaker 7
your sink ratio has dropped an entire eight points.

Speaker 2
Don't think about anything else. Just concentrate the way you used to. - I'm trying to!

Speaker 7
- Asuka's sink ratio is getting lower and lower. - What does it mean, ma'am? - It means trouble. We don't have a spare. Let's concentrate our efforts on fixing Unit Zero. We can't waste time on the one we might not be able to use. - Hmm.

Speaker 4
The litosis process in the left arm of Unit 2 has

Speaker 8
cleared the numerical requirement.

Speaker 4
Code 3. Development of

Speaker 1
necrosis is currently under 0.5. The current status of Unit 0's regeneration is stable. Connecting receptors to the secondary terminal.

Speaker 4
The Avas were created from the angel known as Adam. Now, in order to defeat the angels, We are employing the same forces which caused the second impact and wiped out half of the human race. Only humans could be so foolish as to attempt to harness the engine of our own destruction. I hate the Avas. Is our revenge worth this? Major

Speaker 3
Katsuragi!

Speaker 4
They've started construction on all the Avas through Unit 13? At seven different locations around the world?

Speaker 9
Yeah. This information came from Shanghai. It's reliable.

Speaker 4
So why are they speeding up the construction process now?

Speaker 9
Well, we've lost two Avas and two more are severely damaged. I'd assume they're trying to create a reserve force.

Speaker 4
Perhaps. But we've been receiving spare parts from Germany that were originally intended for AVA Units 5 and 6. They've been spending an awful lot of money

Speaker 9
lately. And that's after they've doubled the existing budget. The executives are being driven by something.

Speaker 4
Yeah. I can almost feel the committee's impatience behind this.

Speaker 9
- Hmm, do you think they're doing this in anticipation of having to intercept multiple angels at once?

Speaker 4
- Huh, except that there's no reason for them to be doing that outside of the official channels. There's got to be some other reason for this.

Speaker 7
- I'm sorry, the telephone number you just dialed is currently not in use. Please try again.

Speaker 1
- That's weird, I still can't get through. I wonder if he went somewhere again. *BEEP*

Speaker 1
Our train will presently be arriving in Terminal 2. For your safety, please wait behind

Speaker 1
the white line until the train has come to a complete stop. That idiot Shinji's Eva just swallowed him for a whole month. And now, he's acting like nothing ever happened. Okay, so I lost this time. That doesn't change the fact that you're a little... I'll smoke!

Speaker 4
This is the first time we've gotten together in a while. Why is there such an air of gloom? I'm finished now. Asuka?

Speaker 1
Why should I get it? It's probably just Kashi calling for you. You should answer your own phone. That's not likely.

Speaker 7
Oh, fine.

Speaker 1
Ah, the invincible Shinji stoops to answering the phone. He doesn't just save the world. Damn him! I hate the way he ignores me. It's a call for you from Germany, Asuka. I think it's your mother. A call for me? My mother? Give me that! Hello?

Speaker 10
Hello,

Speaker 1
Moody!

Speaker 10
Aha!

Speaker 1
When she speaks in a language I can't understand, Asuka seems to be a different

Speaker 10
person. Ja, ja. Ich bin mit die Jungen sehr popul√§r. Ach ja, niemals! Er ist ein selber Mensch. Ja? Yeah? Yeah? Asuka's mother. Really? Ah, so. Das ist aber toll. Ich werde jetzt in Bett gehen. Auf Wiederhauen. Gute Nacht.

Speaker 1
Wow, you two were on the phone quite a while. Well, it was just a routine communication. I wish I talked to my family. It's totally overrated, and it's all just for show. She's not my real mother anyway. Oh? It's not my real mother anyway. I don't feel like I hate her or anything. I just feel like... And why in the hell am I telling all of this to you?! I'm sorry. Ha! I've really hit rock bottom when I get sympathy from a loser like you! It just makes me sick. There's no way I'm bathing in water that Misato and stupid Shinji have used. I won't use a washer that Misato and Shinji the dork have used for washing underwear. And I don't want to have to sit on a toilet that's been used, not by the two of them. I don't even want to breathe the same air they do, not the two of them. I hate Misato, and I hate Shinji, and I hate that first child,

Speaker 8
bitch,

Speaker 1
Rei!

I hate my dad! I hate my mom! But mostly, most of all, I hate my... I hate him! I can't do it anymore! Why do I have to do this? Why me?

Speaker 4
Synchrograph, minus 12.8. It's barely over the starting indicator. That's pathetic. That's an even worse score than yesterday. Asuka's not feeling well

Speaker 7
today. It's her period. Sync ratios aren't influenced by physical changes. The problem's deeper, in her subconscious. It looks like we may have to replace Unit 2's pilot. Asuka? You're finished now. You know,

Speaker 4
Asuka's pride has been badly damaged. It's hard to blame her after she was defeated so badly. But what's worse is that she feels like she was beaten by Shinji. Maybe it's time the three of us stopped living together. So you've hit your limit? Your nice synthetic family is falling apart? I don't have to take that from someone who tries to fill the holes in her own empty life with a bunch of cats. Hmph. I'm sorry. I'm just upset.

Speaker 1
Why do I have to suffer through this just because I'm a girl? It's not like I want to have children anyway! The Route 7 loop is currently closed due to an accident. Please close Route 12 at the gate door.

*Clap* *throwing*

*Sigh*

Speaker 1
This is my fault? I'm blocking myself? - Yes, Ava has its own mind. - It's just a big toy. - Then you don't know? - Now I know something's up when Wonder Girl starts talking to me. What's up? Are you happy that I'm having trouble with my Ava now? Well, don't worry, 'cause when the next angel comes, our invincible Shinji will ride out and destroy it! We little girls want how to fight anymore! They only need that pathetic Shinji! I thought it was bad when Shinji was nice, but when an emotionless, wind-up doll like you starts being sympathetic, I'm doomed! I am not a doll. You are! You'd do anything you're ordered to, don't you? You'd kill yourself if your commander told you to, wouldn't you? Of course. Then you are a robot, just like I thought! You're an unthinking, emotionless pup, and I hate you! I hate you! I hate everyone! Oh!

Speaker 11
Man, it looks like Shinji didn't show up again today. Rei misses class all the time, but...

Speaker 2
Asuka's gone too, and Suzuhara's still in the hospital.

Speaker 11
The situation must be really bad. They're all gone.

Speaker 7
The connection and fusion of VAs are within normal limits. The field of proliferation is within the expected range.

Speaker 1
So, after losing like that, you're finally fixed, are you? You're my doll, and you're supposed to do whatever I tell you to without arguing, do you understand? And why does a weapon need a mind anyway? It just causes more trouble. Anyway, you've got to obey all of my orders, do you hear? This is stupid.

Speaker 3
All personnel go to first stage alert. Prepare for Angel Assault.

Speaker 1
An Angel? Another one?

Speaker 3
We have visual confirmation on the Angel. Maximum magnification. Its orbit is just outside our defense envelope. And it's maintaining a constant distance from us.

Speaker 4
So does that mean it's looking for a nice comfy place to land? Or that it's going to destroy us from way up there?

Speaker 3
We can't attack it from this

Speaker 9
distance.

Speaker 4
Yeah, and unless it decides to come into our range, there's not much we can do offensively. The Avas weren't designed to combat an enemy that's still in orbit. How's Ray? Ray and Unit Zero are both ready and waiting. Understood. Roll out unit zero. Equip it for long-range firing.

Speaker 1
Oscar, be ready to back her up in unit two. You want me to back up unit zero? That's right. Take the rear guard position. You can't be serious. Ava, unit two, launch now! Oscar!

Speaker 7
It's okay. Let her take the point if that's what she wants. Are you sure,

Speaker 3
Major?

Speaker 7
If she screws this up, that bitch won't be piloting anymore. You mean this is her last chance? Start preparing her replacement just to be safe. Right.

Speaker 3
Excuse me, aren't we gonna use Unit 1?

Speaker 4
Unit 1 stays in cryostasis. Those are Commander Ikari's orders. And after what's happened, we better accept that.

Speaker 1
If I fail this time, they won't let me pilot anymore. You can do it, Oscar. You must. The target is still out of range. Damn! Why are you so slow? Come and fight, Angel!

Speaker 3
The enemy has a particle beam weapon? No! No thermal emissions detected! Abnormal reading on Asuka's psychograph.

Speaker 12
Mental contamination imminent. An eco-border attack? The angels understand our psychology that well.

Speaker 3
Pulsatron beam disengaged. It's not working. It's too far out. No more! - No! - Damn, her rifle is out of ammunition. - What's that thing made of? - It's some kind of energy oscillation using visible wavelengths. It's

Speaker 12
similar to an AT field. - How's Asuka? - The mental contamination is crossing her ego borderline. - No! Don't come into me,

Speaker 8
don't!

Speaker 2
*Screams* Get out of my mind! Please, get out of my mind!

Speaker 7
- Asuka! - Let the breath critical! We've got to get Asuka out of there immediately. Her mind is going to be permanently damaged.

Speaker 2
- Asuka, retreat! - No! That was an order, Asuka! I'm ordering you to retreat!

Speaker 1
No! Never! I'd better die than admit defeat now! Asuka!

Speaker 3
Accelerator synchronization initiated. Voltage is increasing. Approaching pressure zone.

Speaker 1
Compulsory focus

Speaker 3
convergence activated. Compensation

for the Earth's rotation and gravity 0.03. Pressure in the chamber is at maximum.

Release the final safety locks.

All personnel, prepare for firing.

Speaker 3
It's no good. There wasn't enough energy to penetrate

Speaker 12
its AT field. It's too far for our weapons. But we're at maximum power output. We can't get any more power. Unit 2's cycle graph is getting weaker. What's the status on the LCL mind barriers? Negative. If we can't even hope for a buffering effect! Switch to life support only. Don't let it feed back into her. I'll try.

Speaker 7
Somehow that ray is scanning into Asuka's mental wavelength. Are the angels trying to analyze what's inside a human mind?

Speaker 1
Why am I crying? I swore that I wouldn't cry. *Screams* Please don't

kill me! No! I'm not Mama's doll! I'll think for myself and I'll live for myself!

Speaker 1
No! Don't make me remember that! I wanted to forget those things! Don't uncover them! I don't want those terrible memories anymore! Stop this! Please stop it now!

Speaker 7
Please, Asuka, die with me.

Speaker 1
If that's what you want, I'll tie with you, Mama. Just please, please don't stop being my mother! Mama! Mama! Mama?

Speaker 1
Are you...? Huh? I'm Asuka, Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh? What are you, stupid?

Speaker 13
Now's my chance.

Speaker 1
Look at me, dammit! Look at me!

Speaker 13
No!

Speaker 1
None of this is the real me! I'm Asuka, Asuka Langley Soryu. Charmed, huh? What are you, stupid? Now's

Speaker 13
my chance...

Speaker 1
LOOK AT ME DAMMITS LOOK AT ME! No! None of this is the real me! Hm? Huh? I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soryu! Charmed, huh? What are you, stupid? Now's my chance... LOOK AT ME

Speaker 2
DAMMITS LOOK AT ME!

Speaker 1
No! None of this is the real me! Hm? Huh? I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soryu! Charmed, huh? What are you, stupid?

Speaker 13
Now's my chance...

Speaker 1
Look at me, dammit! Look at me! No! None of this is the real me! Hmm? Huh? I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soruyu. Charmed, huh? What are you, stupid?

Speaker 13
Now's

Speaker 1
my chance. Look at

Speaker 2
me, dammit! Look at me! No!

None of this is the real me! I'm sorry.

Oh my god, help me!

Why are you there, damn you!

You don't do anything! You won't help me! You won't even hold me!

Speaker 2
You're no one! No

one! No one! Why are you again?

Speaker 1
I is only... Are you alone?

No! Stay away from me!

I'm going to live on my own!

Speaker 2
Do you love me? I won't rely on anyone! Do you feel you love me? I can't live on my own!

Speaker 1
But you're lying.

Speaker 10
No! *Evil

Speaker 1
Scream

Speaker 14
Pilot's mind entering danger zone!

Speaker 3
Position constant! The target hasn't moved yet! The possibility of the target coming into Unit Zero's range is 0.02 percent! Could we airlift Unit

Speaker 4
Zero and try an airborne attack? No, that

Speaker 15
wouldn't work. If the Angel attacked, we'd be defenseless. Let

Speaker 4
me

Speaker 15
go out in Unit One! Forget it! This Angel's ability to attack the Pilot's mind is way too dangerous!

Speaker 5
Yes, we cannot allow Unit One to be touched by an Angel. But

Speaker 12
that can't happen as long as

Speaker 5
I'm not defeated! There is no guarantee of that.

Speaker 12
If we don't do something, Asuka will die! That is

Speaker 5
true. Rey, go to Dogma and get the lance. Use the lance of Loginous! You can't do that, Akari! There is no other way to destroy a target that remains in orbit beyond the reach of our AT fields. Proceed.

Speaker 4
But I thought that if Adam and Ava were to come into contact, it would cause the third impact! We can't take that chance, Commander! It's too dangerous! So that story was another lie. But if contact with an angel didn't cause second impact, then what did? Opening

Speaker 7
Central Dogma barriers 10 through 15. Unit Zero has passed the 6th Malmog√© Trench. Now opening barriers 16 through 20.

Speaker 4
If something like this won't cause third impact, then what really caused second impact?

Speaker 5
Ikari, it's too early to use the lance. The committee has already started to mass produce Avis. This is our chance, Fyutsuki. Our chance, but... We cannot make time run backwards, but we can spur its course forward with our own hands. The old man won't allow this, Ikari. Therefore, we must finish this before Sele has time to act. After all, it is not acceptable to lose Unit 2 at this time. But you just can't

Speaker 15
use the Lance of Longinus without getting Sele's approval first. You're asking for trouble! The need is the justification. There are no other factors to consider. The need? You've just been looking for a convenient excuse, haven't you?

Speaker 3
Pilot's EEG dropping to 0.06! We're past the limits of the life support system! Unit zero's passing through vent two. She'll be coming in over the surface!

Speaker 4
So that's the Lance of Longinus. Unit zero's in position

Speaker 3
to throw! Right in sighted. Error corrections have been made. Starting countdown.

Ten seconds till zero. Nine.

Eight.

Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

Speaker 3
Target annihilated. AVA Unit 2 has been released.

Speaker 15
I need a status update on the Lance.

Speaker 3
The Lance reached escape velocity. It's now moving into a lunar orbit, sir.

Speaker 15
So it's almost impossible to recover now.

Speaker 16
Right. There are no methods available for recovering something of that much mass.

Speaker 1
Unit 2 psychograph returning to normal. Return

Speaker 3
the body to the second cage.

Speaker 1
Returning body via access path 67.

Speaker 4
What's Oscar's status?

Speaker 16
We've confirmed that the pilot's alive. Should we put her in quarantine because of the contamination? Yeah.

Speaker 1
Hey,

Speaker 3
Asuka?

Speaker 1
I'm-- I'm glad you're okay. Shut up! Who the hell is okay? How could it get any worse? That little bitch! That little bitch, Ray, rescued

Speaker 8
me!

Speaker 1
Don't you know that I'd rather have died?

Speaker 8
I hate her! I hate you, Gigi!

Speaker 1
I hate everything!

Speaker 4
In the next episode, AVA Unit Zero and its pilot are possessed and violated by another But even as Rei's mind and body are eaten away, she never loses sight of her inner self. As the angel's corrosive essence eats into her Ava's core, Rei chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice. To protect Shinji from the angel, she surrenders her own essence, taking with her a huge section of Tokyo 3 in a wave of heat and light, and leaving behind only memories in people's souls. It all happens in tears.
