2
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,420
Of course it would have to show up right now of all times.

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,940
Just my luck.

4
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,780
We're sorry.

5
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,520
Due to the state of emergency that has been declared,

6
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,560
all lines are currently out of service.

7
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:24,900
No good.

8
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,220
My cell's not getting a signal either.

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,380
And none of the buses and trains are running.

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,660
so much for meeting here i guess i should go find a shelter

11
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,900
Oh, my God.

12
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,580
Oh no!

13
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000
Hi there! Sorry I'm late.

14
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,500
Target is still active.

15
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,580
Now advancing on Tokyo-3 out of defense perimeter.

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,920
Air Force reports first

17
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,800
wave attacks ineffective.

18
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,340
Launcher full assault.

19
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,060
Fourth Division, close in and cut off its line of advance.

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Hit it with everything you've got.

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,560
Bring that target down at all costs.

22
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,120
What the hell?

23
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,640
Why is it still standing?

24
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
The tank battalion's been wiped out.

25
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,700
That thing is just striding over our defenses like they're not even there damn it then we hit it harder

26
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,980
We can't let it get through

27
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,820
an AT field as we expected

28
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,540
Conventional weapons won't be of any use against an angel

29
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,920
Yes understood will activate the contingency plan

30
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,819
What the heck are they do oh crap they're gonna use an into mine

31
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,500
Get down!

32
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,280
We did it!

33
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,360
Sorry, gentlemen.

34
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,220
It seems you won't be needed here today after all.

35
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,120
Are you okay?

36
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,320
I think...

37
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
I just can't get this dirt out of my mouth.

38
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,840
I'll take that as a yes.

39
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,000
So, ready?

40
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,720
Push on three!

41
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,760
Three!

42
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,900
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?

43
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,000
Thanks for helping me out.

44
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,000
Come on, I should be thanking you, Miss Katsuragi.

45
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,840
Oh, please, it's Misato.

46
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,640
And I'll guess you prefer Shinji over Mr. Ikari.

47
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,460
Yeah.

48
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,660
What's the status of the target?

49
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,920
You saw that explosion. It's over.

50
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,500
Visuals back online.

51
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,100
That was it. Our ace in the hole.

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,920
It had no effect.

53
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,500
God damn it!

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,580
At least the car didn't get totaled.

55
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,760
That would have been bad news.

56
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,100
I've still got 12 payments left on the loan, and I doubt my insurance covers in two mines.

57
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,600
Oh, I also requested express lift service, so that should help us make up some time once we get there.

58
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,460
But you're being awfully quiet. You okay?

59
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
What? Oh, yeah.

60
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,120
You sure? I figured you'd be asking a million questions by now.

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
Um, no. Sorry.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,900
It's nothing you have to apologize for.

63
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,260
It's just, you know, what was that huge thing back there?

64
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,720
Why did I almost get blown to smotherines? Natural responses.

65
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,780
Well, um, guess I figured you wouldn't give me answers

66
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,820
even if I asked.

67
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,640
So, you're the type that likes to assume the worst, huh?

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,200
That's pretty jaded for a kid.

69
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,660
I'm not jaded. I'm just doing what my teacher told me to do, that's all.

70
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh. Well, that's fine.

71
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,420
Incidentally, that thing we saw back there was a life form known as an angel.

72
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,020
*gunfire*

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,380
The fourth angel.

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,800
Its ability to regenerate itself is quite impressive.

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,500
We're dealing with the near perfect lifeform, entirely self-sufficient. It's to be expected.

76
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,380
Those who ate of the fruit of life, indeed.

77
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,300
Yes, they exist only to destroy us who ate of the fruit of wisdom.

78
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,420
*Word*

79
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
Switch gates now closed.

80
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,940
I can't

81
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,100
fear.

82
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,400
Nerve?

83
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,060
Yep.

84
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,100
We're a clandestine organization that answers directly to the UN.

85
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,340
That's where my dad works,

86
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,800
isn't it?

87
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,220
Well, yeah.

88
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,400
You do know what your father does, don't you?

89
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,560
All I know is what my teacher told me.

90
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,780
He said it was something important to mankind's future.

91
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,340
As of now, operational command will be transferred to you and your team.

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,220
It's time to show us what you've got.

93
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,220
I understand.

94
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,400
At this point, it's clear that our weapons do not provide adequate means to deal with the target,

95
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,700
which makes you our last line of defense, Ikari.

96
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,060
So tell us, can you stop this thing?

97
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,820
That's what nerves

98
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,660
for, gentlemen.

99
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,040
Will my dad be waiting for us once we get

100
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,300
there?

101
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,780
I don't know. It depends, I guess.

102
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,360
Dad.

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Oh, that reminds me. Did he happen to send you an ID card?

104
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,860
I think.

105
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,840
Do you mean this?

106
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,240
Perfect, thanks.

107
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,680
And here, you better read this.

108
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,420
Welcome to Nerve?

109
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,900
Wait, so does this mean I'm going to be working for them somehow?

110
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,980
Guess it wouldn't surprise me.

111
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,400
No way Dad would have asked me to come unless he needed something.

112
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,980
Sounds like you and your dad don't get along too well.

113
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
Guess we have that in common.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,680
Wow! That's... it's the real Geofront!

115
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,320
Yep. And that's it, our secret underground base.

116
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,320
Nerve HQ. The key in the effort to rebuild our world and ensure mankind's place in it.

117
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,340
Let's see. From the station's west entrance, we took a ride at Northgate No. 3, which takes us to Route 8.

118
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,080
I swear it's like they set this place up to be confusing on purpose

119
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,320
But I'm pretty sure we're on the right track now though

120
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,160
Um,

121
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,500
are we lost?

122
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,480
I'm new here, okay?

123
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,120
But if we keep moving, we'll get there eventually

124
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,660
Stage

125
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,900
two, cooldown complete

126
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,840
Magnets crew return to surface

127
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,720
Pressure

128
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,100
stable

129
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,340
Finish thawing out the conductors in the left arm

130
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,540
I want it ready in three minutes

131
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,720
And don't forget to chart the apoptosis data during the procedure

132
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,460
Report

133
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,640
for Dr. Rikagi. Arrival of Lieutenant Colonel Katsuragi of Operations Section 1 and one additional member confirmed in SHOUT

134
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:29,220
S365-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5

135
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,680
So this is the boy, I take it?

136
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,580
Yep.

137
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,200
Ritsuko Akagi, head of Project E Technology Division, Section 1.

138
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,040
It's a pleasure.

139
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,680
Uh, yeah.

140
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,580
I'll leave the rest to you.

141
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,480
Their first reunion in three years.

142
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,400
Vice Commander, we've confirmed that the target is coming online.

143
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,500
Understood.

144
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,060
All personnel to battle stations, condition 1.

145
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,740
Revealing, all personnel to battle stations.

146
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,960
Condition one, prepare to intercept the wrong

147
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,360
target.

148
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,360
Shinji Ikari, I'm going to show you something.

149
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,760
You're looking at the most advanced weapons system ever developed by man,

150
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,200
the synthetic humanoid Evangelion.

151
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,300
This is Unit 1, humanity's last hope for survival.

152
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,800
So this is part of my dad's work?

153
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,980
It is?

154
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,400
It's been quite a while.

155
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,400
It's you.

156
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,920
We're moving out.

157
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,940
Moving out?

158
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,600
But Unit Zero is still in suspension, right?

159
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,880
You can't seriously be considering activating Unit One.

160
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
Do you know of another option?

161
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,300
Shinji Ikari.

162
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
You will be the pilot.

163
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,040
Dad, why did you sin for me?

164
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,660
I think the reason has already been made obvious.

165
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,600
So what? You expect me to just get in this thing and fight? Is that it?

166
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,340
Correct.

167
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,000
But that's crazy! Why are you doing this? You never wanted me here before! Why now?

168
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,720
Because now I have a use for you.

169
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,840
But why? Why me, Dad?

170
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,640
It

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,600
would be impossible for anyone else.

172
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,560
It's impossible for me.

173
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,860
I've never even seen anything like this before.

174
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,660
How can I be the pilot?

175
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,100
He'll receive instruction.

176
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,780
No, it...

177
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,320
It just won't work. I...

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,860
I'm telling you, there's no way!

179
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,000
If you're going to do it, do it now.

180
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,740
If not, leave.

181
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,260
Damn it. It knows our location.

182
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,840
Level one. Armor plating eight

183
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,220
destroyed.

184
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,020
Shinji, there isn't much time.

185
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,020
Fire alert. Block D. All personnel, please evacuate immediately.

186
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,680
Get in, Shinji.

187
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,840
It's not fair. If I'd known he'd wanted this...

188
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,680
Oh, why did I come?

189
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,180
Why

190
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,640
did you?

191
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,060
Why did you come, if not for this?

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,540
You mustn't run away.

193
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,780
Not from your father, and especially not from yourself.

194
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,500
I know that, but...

195
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,840
What you're asking is impossible!

196
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,900
Fuyutsuki, begin prepping Rei.

197
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,320
But can we use her?

198
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,280
She's not dead yet.

199
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,160
Understood.

200
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,700
Ray.

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,680
Yes?

202
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,840
We can't use the spare. You're going out.

203
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,600
Yes.

204
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,440
Let's move! Switch out the core unit!

205
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,600
Set Unit 1 to the

206
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,260
L0 type

207
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,180
and reactivate!

208
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,760
Roger. Canceling current operation.

209
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,360
Reconfiguring core unit.

210
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,240
I knew it. He didn't really need me.

211
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,940
No one does.

212
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,700
Target

213
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,080
has blocked the last line of defense.

214
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,260
Moving into position directly overhead.

215
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,680
Are you alright?

216
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,020
I mustn't run away.

217
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,420
I mustn't run away.

218
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,380
I mustn't run away.

219
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,460
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away!

220
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,160
Fine, I'll do it. I'll be your pilot!

221
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,020
Stage three cooldown complete.

222
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,880
Auto-invitation altered. Disengaging.

223
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,380
Auxiliary voltage nominal. Terminal signal plug. Ejecting now.

224
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,800
Ejection confirmed. Inserting entry plug. Releasing spinal cord transmission system. Establishing connection.

225
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,840
Move insertion complete.

Now flooding

234
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,900
entry clock.

235
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,980
Wait, what is this?

236
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,860
Just relax. Once your lungs are filled with the LCL,

237
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
it'll allow your blood to be oxygenated directly.

238
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,760
You'll get used to it.

239
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,580
Primary power source connected.

240
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,260
Round and out.

241
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,060

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,580
Opening communication channel.

252
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,500
Checklist all clear through 1-4-0-5.

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,100
Synapse synchronization rate 41.3%.

254
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,500
And that's without the benefit of a plugsuit. Incredible.

255
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,560
Harmonics are within normal parameters. No instabilities detected.

256
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,000
Right, we're clear.

257
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,340
We are go for launch!

258
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,720
Initiating launch

259
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,160
sequence.

260
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,420
Disengage lock bolt one.

261
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,420
Disengage confirmed.

262
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,200
Retracting a millical bridge.

268
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,000
Internal

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,320
batteries fully charged. External power source connection nominal.

270
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,280
Roger that.

271
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,660
Transfer either Unit 1 to the launch pad.

272
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,980
All unit transport systems are good

273
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,260
to go.

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,420
Red hydraulics operating normally.

275
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,460
Unit 1 currently traveling along path 5-2.

276
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,420
The electromagnetic field adjusted.

277
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,200
Ava Unit 1 has arrived at the launch terminal hub.

278
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,300
Now lock it in position. Awaiting final launch clearance.

279
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,920
List 6, Dabby 5, opening launch gates 1 through 8.

280
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,620
Launch path is clear. All green.

281
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Prep sequence complete.

282
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,080
Understood.

283
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,660
Last chance to abort.

284
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,600
No. Either we stop that Angel, or humanity's future ends here.

285
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,939
Ikari, are you sure this was the right thing to do?

286
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,319
Launch it!

287
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,300
Ready, Shinji?

288
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,100
Yeah, ready.

289
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,020
Here we go! Release final safety!

290
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,580
Evangelion Unit 1, move

291
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,080
out!

292
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,280
Shinji, just concentrate on walking for now.

293
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,180
Walk.

294
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
He's doing it.

295
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,860
Just walk.

296
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,880
Shichi, pull it together!

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
You have to get up!

298
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,620
Now!

299
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,120
Listen to me!

300
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,080
Don't panic!

301
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,800
Your arm isn't really being pulled!

302
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,280
Focus!

303
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,740
Where are the Ava's defenses?

304
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,200
System unresponsive.

305
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,140
The field hasn't deployed.

306
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,820
What? Why?

307
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,940
Left arm damage!

308
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,940
Acer, cut!

309
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:52,880
No!

310
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,560
Xinjiang!

311
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,380
We have a crack in the cranial plating.

312
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
The armor won't last much longer.

313
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,580
Hit damage!

314
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,460
Extent unknown!

315
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,600
Situation critical!

316
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,140
What's the status?

317
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,100
The synchronization graph is inferring!

318
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,140
Pulse reversing!

319
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,760
Break the circuit!

320
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,700
Try to stop it!

321
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,240
No good!

322
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,760
It's rejecting the signal!

323
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,560
We're locked out!

324
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,500
How's Shinji?

325
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,100
No response!

326
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,140
Condition unknown!

327
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,200
Unit 1

328
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,520
is completely

329
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,260
shut down!

330
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,040
Misato!

331
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,320
So

332
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,860
that's it!

333
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,760
Aboard mission! Pilot's safety is top priority!

334
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,600
Get him out of there now! Eject the flock!

335
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,060
It's no use! All remote links have been severed!

336
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,940
No, Shinji!

337
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,020
Unit 1, reactivate!

338
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,560
It's what? That shouldn't be possible!

339
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,000
Unit 1, drop the one normal

340
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,400
power!

341
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,060
Oh no, this call berserk!

342
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,520
We've done it.

343
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,720
It's an AT field.

344
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,140
This is bad.

345
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,780
As long as the Angels got that field up...

346
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,280
We won't be able to touch it.

347
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,060
Left arm restored!

348
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,020
No way!

349
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,000
Unit 1 has also deployed an AT field.

350
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
It's neutralizing the phase space.

351
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,260
My God, it's breaking right through it.

352
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,700
It just tore through that AT field.

353
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,460
like it was nothing.

354
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,720
*Gunshot

355
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,360
So now we've seen it.

356
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,000
The Ava's true form.

357
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
So, have you picked out a name?

358
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,400
If it's a boy, we'll name him Shinji.

359
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,140
If it's a girl, Rei.

360
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,780
Shinji,

361
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,320
Rei.

362
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,980
Shinji, Shinji,

363
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,840
Shinji, Ayanami.

364
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,480
Rei, Rei, Rei Ikari.

365
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,640
No, Rei, Ayanami.

366
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,140
I don't recognize this ceiling.

367
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,920
The fourth Angel's attack and subsequent destruction.

368
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,400
The acquisition of the third child, AVA Unit 1's successful deployment.

369
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,080
All according to plan, it would seem.

370
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,180
The astronomical cost of repair to Unit 1 was an unexpected setback.

371
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,100
Compared to Unit 0's suspension, however, this is a minor concern.

372
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,760
The recovery operation for AVA Unit 1 has been completed.

373
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,920
It's currently being held in Cave 6.

374
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,580
The inspection of the unit is set to take place today at 10 hundred hours.

375
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,120
What about the mission recorder?

376
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,300
Nothing. No data. It went offline when the Ava went berserk.

377
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,880
So we won't know the cause, which means this could happen again.

378
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,120
And next time, we might not be so lucky.

379
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
How serious was this malfunction?

380
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,120
Will the unit be ready when the fifth angel appears?

381
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,740
You needn't be concerned.

382
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,220
Now that Unit 1 is assigned to active duty, Unit 2 and its designated pilot are undergoing evaluation in Germany.

383
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,500
C2 and Unit 3 and the rest are also completed on schedule.

384
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,040
We are counting on you not to disappoint us.

385
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,860
It is your duty to ensure that Nerve and the Evas are utilized appropriately.

386
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,440
Precisely. Annihilating the Angels is only one part of our covenant with Lilith.

387
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,140
The Human Instrumentality Project. This is

388
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,060
our ultimate goal.

389
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,260
I would advise you not to lose sight

390
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,480
of it.

391
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,660
I understand. Rest assured, Sele's plans will soon come to fruition.

392
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,680
The disintegration of the Angel after it lost its Etihad.

393
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,500
It's beyond anything we anticipated.

394
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,200
It's

395
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,560
like staring into the bloody pools of hell. Reminds me of the second impact, you know? Not a good feeling.

396
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,240
The Avas can beat the angels. The fact that we're even here to see this means that mankind has a sliver of hope.

397
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,560
It seems the pilot shouldering that hope has just woken up.

398
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,680
Paging Dr. Ugai. Dr. Ugai, Eternal Medicine 1. Please contact Dr. Azuma in Surgery 1 immediately.

399
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,880
Medical conference with

400
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520
incident B will be held in schedule.

401
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,440
All project coordinators, please proceed to conference room 2.

402
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,100
Alone? Seriously?

403
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,060
That's

404
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,240
right.

405
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,020
His room will

406
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,320
be in block six up ahead. I trust you have no problem with that.

407
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,780
No. What? Really? You're okay with this?

408
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,540
Yeah, it's fine. I'd rather be alone. It's... well, it's what I'm used to.

409
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,440
What did you say? You heard me. I said I decided to let Shinji stay at my place. What's the big deal?

410
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,300
I cleared it with the higher-ups. You don't have to worry about a thing. I promise I won't put the moves on him.

411
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:23,440
I

412
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,840
hope not! Why would you even say something like that, honestly?

413
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Oh yeah, she never did have a sense of humor.

414
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,000
So, what do you say?

415
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,460
You ready to live it up tonight?

416
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:35,880
I

417
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,520
don't know.

418
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,000
Come on, let me throw a welcome party for my new roomie.

419
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,740
It'll be fun.

420
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,100
Is it true? You're really moving?

421
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,320
We sure are.

422
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,100
I mean, we never dreamed this place would really turn into a war zone.

423
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,420
It's just gotten too dangerous.

424
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,540
I know what you mean.

425
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,860
My husband is telling me that the children and I should evacuate too.

426
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,300
Oh, did you hear?

427
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,720
There were over 100 relocation notices filed this morning alone.

428
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,160
It doesn't surprise me.

429
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,360
I don't care how much they fortify this city.

430
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,040
When it comes down to it, you can't count on nerve or anything.

431
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,220
Oh, I think the shiver's just thinking about yesterday.

432
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,460
How close we came?

433
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,860
I know, right?

434
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,380
Hope you don't mind, but we need to make a tiny little side trip.

435
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,040
Where are we going?

436
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,500
Somewhere nice. You'll see.

437
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,940
From up here, the city just looks so lonely.

438
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,840
It's time.

439
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,480
*music*

440
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,380
Amazing!

441
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,860
The buildings, they're growing!

442
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,360
This whole city is a fortress built to intercept angels.

443
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,080
It's our city, Tokyo 3.

444
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Take a good look down there.

445
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,840
You see it?

446
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,260
That's the city you protected.

447
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,660
Oh, good.

448
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,520
It looks like they delivered your stuff already.

449
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,080
I just moved in here the other day myself,

450
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,100
so I still have some unpacking to do, too.

451
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,180
Well, come in.

452
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,020
Okay.

453
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,200
Thanks for having me.

454
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,740
Shinji, this is your home now.

455
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Just come in.

456
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,240
Well, home sweet home.

457
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,920
Home sweet home.

458
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,260
Oh, sorry it's a little messy.

459
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,540
Like I said, I'm just settling in.

460
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,960
This is a

461
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,460
little messy?

462
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,180
Hey, while you're

463
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,620
out there,

464
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,240
would you put the food away in the fridge?

465
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,560
Yeah, sure.

466
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,040
Ice?

467
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,300
Snacks?

468
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,640
Nothing but beer?

469
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,140
What did I get myself into?

470
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,920
All right.

471
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,340
Let's dig in.

472
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,260
Uh, okay.

473
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,260
Ah!

474
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Yeah!

475
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,280
I tell you, Shinji, it's moments like these that make it all worthwhile, don't you think?

476
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,580
You're not eating.

477
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,340
I know it's all microwave food, but it's good, trust me.

478
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,760
Well,

479
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,940
it's just, I don't usually eat

480
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,380
stuff like

481
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,120
this, so...

482
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,900
Are you being

483
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,560
picky?

484
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,760
No, I just

485
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,860
meant that...

486
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,200
It looks good.

487
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,020
Kind of nice, right?

488
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,900
Two roomies sitting down to a hot home-cooked meal.

489
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,420
Right.

490
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,760
Good, because from now on, this is your place as much as it is mine.

491
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,300
So kick back and make yourself comfortable, okay?

492
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,320
All right.

493
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,220
Right, right, right, right.

494
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,540
Is that all you know how to say?

495
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,280
Step out of it!

496
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,680
You can't just agree on everything anyone tells you!

497
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,020
Right?

498
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,860
Anyway, I know just the thing you need.

499
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,880
A nice hot bath to clear your head.

500
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,020
Wash all those worries down the drain.

501
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,040
Misato, there's a thing!

502
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,280
A what?

503
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,720
I don't know if it's...

504
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,680
Oh, that thing.

505
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,040
He's a bird, actually.

506
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,120
A warm-water penguin.

507
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,560
Since when do birds like that even exist?

508
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,000
Since always, I guess.

509
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,340
Though they're rare these days.

510
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,880
His name's Pen-Pen.

511
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,600
I should have mentioned he lives with me.

512
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,860
Just think of him as another roomie.

513
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,000
And now that you've met, why don't you go cover up?

514
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,080
Maybe I was acting just a little too cheery.

515
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But it was all I could do to keep a straight face.

516
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,360
Misato Katsuragi.

517
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,560
She's not a bad person.

518
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,980
She means well.

519
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,260
Wash all those worries down the drain.

520
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,020
But for me, baths only bring back a wash of bad memories.

521
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,300
How did Ray seem this afternoon?

522
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,100
You went to see her today, didn't you?

523
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,040
At the hospital?

524
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,300
She'll be fine.

525
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,240
She'll be ready when it's time to reactivate Unit Zero.

526
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,260
That's all that matters.

527
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,760
Then what about your son?

528
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,660
Psychologically speaking, he seems rather unstable.

529
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,920
Let him be.

530
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,200
If nothing else, it gives us an excuse to bring Unit Zero out of suspension.

531
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,320
Then we'll act in accordance with Lieutenant Colonel Katsuragi's suggestion.

532
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,900
The third child suddenly selected without a preliminary report.

533
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,900
And the timing of the Angel attack the same day he was scheduled to arrive.

534
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,920
Not only that, but the fact that he's Commander Ikari's son.

535
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
The coincidences just keep stacking up.

536
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,900
Yet we did defeat the angel that has to count

537
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,500
for something.

538
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,340
But I still don't like it.

539
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,080
Another ceiling I don't recognize.

540
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
I guess that's no surprise.

541
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,220
There's no place in this entire city I'm familiar with.

542
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,540
Shinji, this is your home now.

543
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,780
Why

544
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,060
am I

545
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,440
here?

546
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,700
Shinji, I'm opening the door, okay?

547
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,660
Listen, I forgot to tell you something.

548
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,400
What you did the other day was a good thing, an admirable thing.

549
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,120
You should feel proud, okay?

550
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,340
Okay, Shinji. Hang in there.

551
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,660
Sorry about that, new kid. Thing is, I owed you one and I had to do it.

552
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,760
It just wasn't gonna feel right until I did.

553
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,379
I apologize. Don't take it personally, though.

554
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,520
Toji's sister got hurt in that mess the other day.

555
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,700
Well, I guess I'll see you around.

556
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,580
What did I do? It's not like I wanted to

557
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,520
be the pilot.

558
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,919
What?

559
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,800
Are you ready, Shinji?

560
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,399
Yes.

561
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,040
As you know, all angels have a part called the core.

562
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,139
It is their one

563
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:57,700
weak spot.

564
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,340
Destroying it is the only way we can physically eradicate an angel.

565
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,060
This is what you'll aim for.

566
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,300
Center in on the target, and then pull the trigger.

567
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,660
Repeat this drill until you've learned to do it by feel.

568
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,060
Right.

569
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,780
Yes, very good. We'll continue practicing in the induction mode for now.

570
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,160
Right.

571
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,280
I must say I'm a bit surprised that Shinji agreed to be a pilot again.

572
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,840
I think he's just the type that does what he's told.

573
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,760
I'd guess that until now, that's how he's gotten through life.

574
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,740
Center in on the target and then pull the trigger.

575
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,580
Center in on the target and then pull the trigger.

576
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,940
Center in on the target and then pull the trigger.

577
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,360
Center in on the target and then pull the trigger.

578
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,480
That reminds me.

579
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,120
I heard Shinji was hit by a classmate on his first

580
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,680
day of school.

581
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,520
Are you sure we have adequate security for the pilots?

582
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,160
The intelligence department has them under constant surveillance.

583
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,120
He was never in any real danger.

584
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,440
Besides, I think it's better not to interfere in his private life if we can avoid it.

585
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,460
Says the woman who's living with him.

586
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,880
His maintenance is still part of your job, isn't it?

587
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,920
Technically speaking, he's just so much more naive and complicated than I expected.

588
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,320
Complaining already. You're the one who insisted on taking him in.

589
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,560
Oh, shut up.

590
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,320
You're right, though.

591
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,020
From what I've been able to tell of him, Shinji's personality may not be geared toward making friends.

592
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,620
Have you ever heard of the hedgehog's dilemma?

593
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,100
Hedgehogs? Those little spiky critters?

594
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,840
See, with hedgehogs, even if they want to get close to one another for warmth,

595
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,000
the closer they get, the more they risk hurting each other with the quills on their bodies.

596
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,120
It's really no different for people.

597
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,080
Shinji is worried about what will happen if he lets someone get too close.

598
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,060
He's afraid of that pain, and that's made him pull away completely.

599
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,460
Can you believe this? It's crazy, right?

600
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,500
I know.

601
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,240
Well, he'll figure it out someday.

602
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,100
The part of growing up is allowing yourself to get hurt sometimes.

603
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:22,280
To keep letting people in until you finally find that safe distance where you can be close without hurting each other too much.

604
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,040
I hope you're right.

605
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,720
Jeez, when are they going to approve the budget to repair this part of Building V anyway?

606
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,220
Maintaining the Avas and keeping them equipped takes top priority.

607
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,360
So, probably never.

608
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,060
They could at least bring for seat warmers.

609
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,120
There's an emergency.

610
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,780
Come on, let's go.

611
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,300
We have a confirmed visual on the object.

612
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,420
E-747 target verified.

613
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,860
Analysis pattern blue. It's here. The fifth angel.

614
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,540
Now, battle stations, condition one.

615
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,240
Roger that. Preparing city for ground-to-air interception.

616
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,480
Tokyo-3 transitioning to battle configuration.

617
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,080
Central block commencing retraction.

618
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,120
I'm sorry.

619
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,400
*Extreme music*

620
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,380
Transition complete. Central block and districts 1 through 7 have been retracted.

621
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,080
Government

622
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,880
ministries and

623
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,100
military departments have been notified.

624
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:25,600
Target

625
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,900
is continuing its advance.

626
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,120
Air

627
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,960
defense system currently operating at 48%.

628
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,280
Status of non-combat personnel and civilians.

629
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,040
So far, all districts reporting successful evacuation.

630
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,440
Students, please stay with your class.

631
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,440
All other residents, please proceed to your designated blog.

632
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,580
The District 7

633
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,480
lost children's...

634
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,760
Man, they're doing it again.

635
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,640
Where they just post some goofy message?

636
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,320
It's what you call a news blackout.

637
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,940
They don't want civilians like us to see what's going on.

638
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,300
A major event like this doesn't seem fair.

639
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,320
A waste of the taxpayer's money.

640
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,840
I guess these military types just won't be satisfied until they've fired all their bullets.

641
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,560
Japanese government, they're requesting EVO mobilization.

642
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:11,900
They just

643
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,860
don't get it, do they?

644
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,160
We'll mobilize whether they request it or not.

645
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,800
LCL charged.

646
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,780
Crip lock released.

647
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,600
Dad isn't even watching.

648
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,780
Why am I piloting this thing again when everyone hates me for it?

649
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,960
Hey, I need to talk to you about something in private, okay?

650
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,260
Yeah, what?

651
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,720
Come

652
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,600
on, now.

653
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,320
Fine, whatever.

654
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,260
Right,

655
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,340
so then you said...

656
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:39,480
Hey, class rep.

657
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:40,940
What's up?

658
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,100
We gotta go, you know, take a leak.

659
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
Really? Oh, come on, you guys. You should've done that earlier.

660
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,820
So what do you want?

661
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,240
I

662
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,920
gotta see

663
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,220
it. I mean, just once before I die.

664
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,500
The shootout up there?

665
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,600
This is it. The real deal.

666
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,380
And there's no telling when another one of those things will come along.

667
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,460
Kensuke, man. I don't know.

668
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,120
But this

669
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,760
might be the only chance we ever get.

670
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,900
Come on, please. I just need you to help me with the lock.

671
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,640
All right.

672
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,400
You know, you can be pretty damn pushy sometimes.

673
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,880
Has anyone ever told you that?

674
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,840
Shinji, it's time to mobilize. Are you ready?

675
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:15,860
Yeah.

676
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,200
Listen closely.

677
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,340
As you neutralize the enemy's AT field,

678
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,140
fire a volley with the Gatling gun.

679
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,460
Do it just like we practiced and you'll be fine.

680
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,220
Right.

681
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,340
Move out!

682
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,780
Sweet!

683
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,600
Definitely makes all the trouble we're gonna get in worth it.

684
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,180
Here's the main event!

685
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,640
*Mario*

686
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,580
Awesome.

687
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,000
Center enemy to rank and then pull the trigger.

688
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
Just like we practiced, alright Shinji?

689
00:41:59,460 --> 00:41:59,700
Right.

690
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,500
And...

691
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,420
Check your fire! You'll lose the target at the blast class!

692
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,000
He's already getting thrashed.

693
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,140
He'll be fine.

694
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,600
We're sending out the spare rifle.

695
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,680
Take it!

696
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,800
Shinji!

697
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,040
Shinji!

698
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,560
Wow.

699
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,660
Maybe he's still not seeing straight from that beating again.

700
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,240
You shut up!

701
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,560
Umbilical cable severed.

702
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,420
Ava has switched to internal power.

703
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,240
Operational time, 4 minutes 53 seconds.

704
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,120
It's coming this way!

705
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,600
Shinji, are you alright?

706
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:22,180
Shinji! What's the damage?

707
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,680
None. All combat

708
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
systems operational.

709
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,920
What the? Two of Shinji's classmates?

710
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,500
What are they doing out there?

711
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,480
Why the hell doesn't he fight it?

712
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,700
I'm thinking it might be because we're here.

713
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,420
He can't fight with us in the way.

714
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,080
Unit 1

715
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,120
has 3 minutes, 28 seconds operational time remaining.

716
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,900
Contact service melting. Damage is 15%.

717
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,800
Shinji, let those two in the cockpit.

718
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,720
Once you have them secured, we will retreat and regroup.

719
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,620
Go, now!

720
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,540
You two,

721
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,300
get in!

722
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,120
Quickly!

723
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,820
What the hell?

724
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,980
There's water in here?

725
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,200
A camera!

726
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,080
Contact service!

727
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,800
Protected film three melting!

728
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,120
Now hurry get out of there retreat

729
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,500
Use extraction route number 34

730
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,360
New kid, I think they're telling you to run

731
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,220
I mustn't run away

732
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,280
Progressive knife equip

733
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,980
Shinji, I gave you an order. Retreat! Shinji!

734
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,800
That stupid boy.

735
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,200
*Gunshot*

736
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,180
*Screaming*

737
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,180
*Screaming*

738
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,300
*Screaming*

739
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,920
Time remaining till complete unit failure!

740
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:27,880
Thirty seconds!

741
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:28,860
Twenty-eight!

742
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,000
Twenty-seven!

743
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:30,960
Twenty-six!

744
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:31,980
Twenty-five!

745
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,000
Twenty-four!

746
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:33,920
Twenty-three!

747
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,000
Twenty-two!

748
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,200
Ava, Unit 1 has come to a halt.

749
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,780
Target has completely disintegrated.

750
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,060
*crying*

751
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,620
Shinji, why did you ignore my orders up there?

752
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm sorry.

753
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,340
I am your superior officer in charge of your missions.

754
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,300
Yeah.

755
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,860
Which means you have an obligation to follow my orders no matter what.

756
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,040
Do you understand?

757
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,040
Yeah.

758
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,780
Then make sure this never happens again.

759
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:01,960
Yeah.

760
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,260
Are you even listening to what I'm saying?

761
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeah, I hear you.

762
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,180
Loud and clear.

763
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,020
But what does it matter anymore?

764
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:11,720
We won.

765
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Look, I'll pilot it when you tell me to.

766
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,360
That's all you really won, isn't it?

767
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,900
We're done here.

768
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,400
Go home and get some rest.

769
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,440
I'll be there soon.

770
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,540
*Sigh*

771
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,540
*Sigh*

772
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,660
We have fun today.

773
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,300
We are just waiting for taking care of you.

774
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,800
Try a special service to improve your fitness.

775
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,080
We're dead.

776
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,000
Happy birthday.

777
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,040
So he's not coming home.

778
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,900
Damn that boy.

779
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,220
-

780
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,260
Icari? Shinji

781
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,740
Icari?

782
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,820
Hmm, so our newest student is already absent.

783
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,620
Well, I suppose we can forgive him just this once.

784
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,280
As for the rest of you, it's time for a pop quiz.

785
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,740
Oh, that's so exciting.

786
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,680
That's it. I'm ready, all right. You can take me back to Misato now.

787
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,160
So, do you feel better after your little walk?

788
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,660
Was it worth it?

789
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:01,960
Not really.

790
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,060
But I don't care anymore.

791
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,060
Not about any of it.

792
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,460
And even if I did, it's not like I have any choice.

793
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,320
I'm an Ava pilot now.

794
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:14,680
Nothing else.

795
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,920
That's what Dad called me here for, right?

796
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,400
That's what you all want.

797
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,120
So you win. I'll pilot it. If that's what makes everyone happy, then fine.

798
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,160
And what about you? Is this what you want?

799
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,100
I know I'm not cut out for this. I mean, is that really so hard for anyone to see?

800
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,980
But until Rey gets better, you and Dad and everyone expects me to That's

801
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,840
enough! This isn't about what

802
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,280
other people want! This is your choice! You decide

803
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,400
for yourself whether or not you're gonna pilot the Ava.

804
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,480
If you don't want to do it, leave.

805
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,060
You're free to go at any time you'd like.

806
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,140
It's up to you.

807
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,640
I had my doubts, but in the end, your son behaved exactly as you predicted he would.

808
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,340
Yes. Next, I'll have him begin getting closer to Rey.

809
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,860
The plan will proceed unchanged.

810
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,000
Following the script we laid out for these children 14 years ago,

811
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,439
the story of their lives...

812
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,240
It's almost cruel.

813
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,320
Just hurry up and do it.

814
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,480
Come on, what are you waiting for?

815
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,420
Just do it or I'm not gonna feel right. Come on!

816
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,640
I know he means that too.

817
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,580
Go on,

818
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,820
you'll be doing him a favor.

819
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,520
Okay, now we're even.

820
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,460
Sorry I decked you the other day.

821
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,140
Go!

822
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,860
Go!

823
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:56,400
Hurry!

824
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,720
Better hurry!

825
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,040
Do you have to see it though?

826
00:52:59,160 --> 00:52:59,760
All right!

827
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,140
Go!

828
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,880
Take the shot!

829
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,220
Hey,

830
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,100
come on, guys!

831
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,720
Don't worry!

832
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,780
Ew, the boys are down there gawking again!

833
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:05,500
Whoa!

834
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,400
They're so bad.

835
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,780
Look at Toji with those pervy little eyes.

836
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,580
Rei Ayanami, 14 years old.

837
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,660
She was our first qualified pilot, chosen in accordance with the Marduk report.

838
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,720
The first child, the designated pilot for the Evangelion prototype Unit Zero.

839
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,100
Beyond that, her history is a blank.

840
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,620
It's been completely erased from official records.

841
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,380
And my dad? When she got hurt, he's the one who saved her?

842
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,520
Abnormality

843
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,620
and activation system!

844
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,580
Irregularity detected in stage 3!

845
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,320
Signs of internal

846
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,000
projection in central nerve elements.

847
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,100
Interference in main transmission!

848
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,280
Hull reversing! We can't stop it!

849
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,160
Direct monitors

850
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,600
disconnected.

851
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,160
Interference in

852
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,600
main transmission.

853
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,400
Blood depth unstable! It's being drawn toward the AVA!

854
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,520
Abort contact!

855
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,980
Emergency shutdown circuits 1 through 6!

856
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,400
This is not working! The signal isn't getting through!

857
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,880
Unit Zero is out of

858
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,280
control!

859
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,680
Abort the experiment. Cut the main power.

860
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,220
Yes, sir.

861
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,780
Unit Zero has switched to auxiliary power.

862
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,340
35 seconds to complete

863
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,120
system shutdown.

864
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,600
Automatic taping system still not responding.

865
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,280
Sir, it's dangerous. Get back!

866
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,120
Emergency auto ejection activating!

867
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:26,760
Shut it down!

868
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,920
Special bagel I heard!

869
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,200
No, Ray!

870
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,880
Ten seconds, complete system shutdown!

871
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:50,080
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,

872
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,160
one!

873
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,320
Unit Zero is now offline!

874
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,420
Ray, are you alright?

875
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,680
Ray!

876
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:18,720
I understand.

877
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,200
That doesn't

878
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,040
really strike me as something Ikari would do.

879
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,860
His part in it has been expunged from the official report, but it definitely happened.

880
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,500
And even after all that, he still wants to take Unit Zero out of suspension.

881
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,480
Aren't we being a bit hasty?

882
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,420
The Angels have forced our hand.

883
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,880
We need every weapon in our arsenal that we can get.

884
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,740
That's true, but still.

885
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,700
Rey's reactivation tests have already been completed,

886
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,340
and there are no problems with Unit Zero itself.

887
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,340
All that's left is to calibrate the neural connections and then she'll immediately be put back on active duty, huh?

888
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,360
Rey, she's always alone.

889
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,020
Why is that?

890
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:10,920
Ava unit one entering stage three cool down. Page six. Received with system shutdown checklist. Pages one through three.

891
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:11,860
Copy

892
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,620
all personal data from entry phone from LQR analysis.

893
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,280
*Sigh*

894
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,240
I'm getting used to it.

895
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,680
Then things are settling in.

896
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,480
This isn't your first time living with a guy, as I recall.

897
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:50,480
Nah.

898
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,940
But this isn't

899
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,000
anything like eight years ago.

900
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,180
It's not a romantic thing, for one.

901
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,680
I don't know about that.

902
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,000
It could be.

903
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,060
Shinji's only staying here because of you.

904
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:00,980
No.

905
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,740
I'd say it's mostly for his dad.

906
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,340
He's hoping his dad will finally notice him.

907
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:09,700
Maybe get to know him.

908
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,240
Have any kind of contact.

909
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,480
Just one little word of praise.

910
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:14,920
That's all it

911
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,100
would take. And then he'd know he's not alone.

912
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,260
So these issues with his father, I'm guessing you can relate?

913
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,760
I just don't get it. How can Commander Ikari be so disinterested in his own son?

914
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,520
He has no problem talking to Rei. It just doesn't seem fair.

915
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,840
But is it that unusual? Powerful men are notoriously self-absorbed.

916
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,520
That still doesn't make it any easier to watch, you know?

917
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,740
At any rate, I think it's time I was getting back.

918
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,860
Always the good little workaholic, aren't you?

919
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,820
Oh, here. As long as you're going home, take these.

920
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,520
Shinji's official security card and Rei's renewal. I missed her earlier.

921
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,760
If you could, ask Shinji to give it to her tomorrow.

922
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,020
Yeah, sure.

923
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,600
Rei Ayanami.

924
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,220
Why does dad smile when he sees her?

925
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,840
Why won't he smile for me?

926
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:45,300
I don't know.

927
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,680
Anybody home?

928
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,140
It's Shinji. Shinji Ikari.

929
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,180
Rei?

930
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,340
I'm coming in.

931
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,400
*Gasp*

932
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,620
Does Ray wear glasses?

933
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,819
Ray, I was just...

934
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,040
I wasn't snooping.

935
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:58,980
I...

936
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,140
Ah!

937
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:30,940
Would you get off me?

938
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,140
I was...

939
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,220
What?

940
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:56,940
Wait, I...

941
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:57,780
But I...

942
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,800
I... I was just...

943
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,380
I was... I was asked to...

944
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:07,760
To...

945
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:09,740
What was it?

946
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,040
Oh, the card! There's a new card!

947
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,840
They asked me to bring it!

948
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,100
So, uh...

949
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:18,560
So...

950
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,120
It's not like I meant to...

951
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,500
Ritsuko!

952
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,720
She forgot to give it to you.

953
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:30,860
Honest.

954
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,360
And no one answered when I rang the doorbell.

955
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,260
And the door was unlocked.

956
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,300
So, uh...

957
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,280
I...

958
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,920
Central dog bell is currently open.

959
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,740
Group 3 personnel are requested to use direct gate 4.

960
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,700
Like I was trying to say, they issued you a new one. Ritsuko asked me to give it to you.

961
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,980
Sorry about earlier.

962
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:13,560
For what?

963
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,220
Hey, um, aren't you scared at all?

964
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,240
I mean about getting back in the Eva why I

965
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,840
Heard you that hurt pretty bad during the last experiment, so I

966
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,760
Was wondering if you know you were still fine with piloting

967
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:41,520
Yes, I'm fine, but you don't know when it might go berserk again, right?

968
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,980
Aren't you worried? What if it happens in the middle of a battle

969
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,380
with an angel and we lose?

970
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,000
Tell me your commander Ikari son, aren't you?

971
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,500
Then why are you scared? Don't you have faith in his work?

972
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,460
No, how could I? I mean, how could anyone?

973
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:02,760
What's wrong?

974
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,000
Oh,

975
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,680
my God.

976
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:38,620
approaching so it does let's send unit one out to meet it

977
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,560
AVA unit one prepare for launch switch into anti-air interstate equipment

978
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,420
target in range now entering lake tashi airspace AVA unit one equipped and ready to launch let's move out

979
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,560
I'm reading increased target energy levels.

980
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,520
Wait, it's charging up?

981
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,180
Oh, no!

982
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,020
Look out!

983
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,380
That's too much for him. Lower the sink rate.

984
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,420
Deploy the blast shield.

985
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:30,800
Hey!

986
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,660
Abort! Execute emergency recovery of AVA Unit 1!

987
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,140
We can't! The catapult is melted! It won't operate!

988
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,400
What about the AT field?

989
01:04:59,420 --> 01:04:59,900
It's been raced

990
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,760
to maximum levels.

991
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,840
It's just barely managing to maintain integrity.

992
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,620
That's it. Scrap the mission. Prioritize pilot safety.

993
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,240
Initiate clog ejection.

994
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,620
No. Cancel that.

995
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,680
If we were to eject the pilot now, the Ava's AT field would vanish and the unit would be destroyed.

996
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,880
We'd be placing ourselves in a near hopeless situation.

997
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,240
Yes, but...

998
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,000
There's no other choice.

999
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,060
Force of all recovery of Unit 1!

1000
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,540
Denonate explosive bolts!

1001
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,840
*Dramatic music*

1002
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:04,780
Target has ceased attack.

1003
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,160
Transfer unit 1 to emergency cage 99.

1004
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,820
Medical team, stand by!

1005
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,900
Top priority goes to cooling the LTL

1006
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,480
at times 5.

1007
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,640
- It's repeating a pulse, but it's fake.

1008
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,100
- Maximize the plug to its life support system.

1009
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,000
Cardiac massage.

1010
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:16,780
- Yes, ma'am.

1011
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,500
Vital stabilized.

1012
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,460
- Good, now force eject the plug.

1013
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,720
- In response, force eject sequence initially.

1014
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,500
- LCL emergency release.

1015
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,300
Yes, ma'am.

1016
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:29,820
- LCL

1017
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,300
training.

1018
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,020
- Where's that medical team?

1019
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,140
I'm sorry.

1020
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,260
The target has started its attack from directly overhead.

1021
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,740
It's drilling straight down to the geofront.

1022
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:15,960
So

1023
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,580
this one's looking to hit us where we live.

1024
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,420
It's coming right for Nerve headquarters.

1025
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,740
Okay, people. Analysis reports. Give me something.

1026
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,900
Based on earlier target data, we have surmised that the target automatically eliminates all hostiles that approach within a certain range.

1027
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,060
which means close-quarter combat with the Avas is out

1028
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:32,520
of the question.

1029
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,360
What about its AT field?

1030
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,500
It's up and running.

1031
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:38,700
On top of that, it keeps its phase pattern constantly shifting.

1032
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,120
That's why it changes shape.

1033
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,320
It'll be extremely difficult to neutralize.

1034
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:43,980
According to Magi's calculations,

1035
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,420
it is theoretically possible to penetrate the target's AT field

1036
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,300
using a delivery of aerial N-2 bombs.

1037
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,500
However, a blast of the magnitude required

1038
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,380
would destroy NERF headquarters as well.

1039
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,280
Yes, Magi-2 and Matsushiro came to the same conclusion.

1040
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,120
And it seems the Japanese government and the UN

1041
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,280
are proposing attacks

1042
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,280
that involve Nerve Headquarters self-destructing.

1043
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,500
That's ridiculous. They obviously don't realize what's at stake here.

1044
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,100
If this place goes, it's all over for everyone.

1045
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,520
But ma'am, it may already be too late.

1046
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:14,020
By our latest reports, the target's drill has penetrated armor level 2,

1047
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,320
with no signs of slowing down.

1048
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,080
There are 22

1049
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,160
completed armor belts between us and the surface.

1050
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,020
At present rate, penetration of all remaining levels is expected to occur

1051
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,160
tomorrow morning at 6 minutes, 54 seconds past midnight.

1052
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,200
Less than 10 hours, 15 minutes away.

1053
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,960
Unit Zero hasn't been calibrated yet, so it's

1054
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,900
still not combat And

1055
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,020
the

1056
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:36,400
earlier damage to Unit One means it won't be fully operational for quite some time. So

1057
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,940
things aren't looking good for us at the moment.

1058
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:38,759
What

1059
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:40,759
do you mean? We're completely out of options.

1060
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:41,240
We

1061
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,660
could try sending up a white flag.

1062
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:44,580
There's

1063
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,720
a thought. But before

1064
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,839
we do that, there's one other little thing I want to look into. Those secret

1065
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,319
SSDF research papers. Intelligence still

1066
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:52,920
has them, right?

1067
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,620
I've got to hand it to you.

1068
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,000
You've concocted some crazy plans before.

1069
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:13,180
But this one tops them all.

1070
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,160
It's executable in nine hours.

1071
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,560
And it gives us a fighting chance against the Angel.

1072
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,740
Now, which part of that is crazy exactly?

1073
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,140
Operation Yashima.

1074
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:21,839
Let's see.

1075
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:28,180
You're requisitioning electricity from all over Japan so that you can charge a high-power, self-propelled positron cannon,

1076
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,180
a top-secret prototype which you've somehow commandeered from the SSDF Research Institute.

1077
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:39,859
It's incomplete, so to make up for its lack of a targeting system, you're going to use the AVA as a precision sniper.

1078
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,799
Nothing crazy-sounding about that.

1079
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,740
I'll tell you, the UN forces are one thing, but I'm amazed you managed to talk SSDF internal affairs into this.

1080
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:48,359
Well,

1081
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,380
they owe me a few fakes.

1082
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,160
Like they say, set a fox to catch a fox.

1083
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,220
Please be advised, tonight from midnight until

1084
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,540
dawn, there will be a large-scale nationwide power outage.

1085
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:03,880
We

1086
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,540
ask all citizens for their cooperation during this time. Repeating.

1087
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:13,980
Please be advised, tonight from midnight until dawn, there will be a large-scale nationwide power outage.

1088
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,400
Okay, here goes.

1089
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,380
Please be advised, tonight from midnight until dawn, there will be a

1090
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,700
large-scale nationwide power outing.

1091
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,020
We ask all citizens for their cooperation during this time.

1092
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,180
The Angels drill has just penetrated armor level seven.

1093
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,040
How are things coming with the power system?

1094
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:56,960
The power system will be supplied directly from the new Gotemba substation

1095
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,520
at two auxiliary locations.

1096
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,580
We are currently laying superconductive supply

1097
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,100
cables

1098
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:01,700
towards lower

1099
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,500
Futago Mount.

1100
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,960
Full transformer array and all lines are expected to be ready

1101
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,140
for power by 2250 hours tonight.

1102
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,140
And what's the progress on that sniper mount?

1103
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,960
Well, it's starting to come together.

1104
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:12,520
Give

1105
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,260
me a few more hours

1106
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,340
and I'll have it ready for you.

1107
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,900
AVA Unit 1, status.

1108
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,220
Maintenance crews refitting Unit 1 with Type-G sniper equipment.

1109
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,420
Estimated time to completion, two hours.

1110
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,200
Understood.

1111
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,320
Then I guess all that leaves is the pilot.

1112
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,480
You think he's willing?

1113
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,480
He may not want to get in again.

1114
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,940
How do you propose we handle the matter of Unit 1's pilot?

1115
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,600
We have yet to run a successful test on the dummy plugs.

1116
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,640
We'll try to keep the current pilot in place until they're more practical for use.

1117
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,160
Worst case, there's always brainwashing.

1118
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,660
No, if it doesn't work out, we'll use Ray.

1119
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,940
Have her pilot Unit 1?

1120
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:51,480
We'd be taking an enormous risk.

1121
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,600
We'll resort to whatever means are required.

1122
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,900
If we're to succeed, there are eight more angels that must be defeated.

1123
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,960
Only then will it all begin.

1124
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,980
I don't like it, being a naval pilot.

1125
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,400
It's expected that I always do well, so no one ever thanks me for it.

1126
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,600
And if I fail, everyone hates me, unless I get killed.

1127
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,940
So why am I even still here?

1128
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,220
I only came because I thought something might change.

1129
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,380
That something good might happen.

1130
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,840
I didn't come here to feel miserable.

1131
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,480
Is that really how you want to keep living your life?

1132
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,540
Running away when things get hard?

1133
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:40,680
My life.

1134
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:42,980
Why am I alive?

1135
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,720
I used to think being alive was pointless.

1136
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,820
No one needs me.

1137
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,920
Not Dad, not Misato.

1138
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,020
If I'm not in the Ava, I'm not needed at all.

1139
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,480
That's why I have no choice but to be a pilot.

1140
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,420
That's why I have to stay here.

1141
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,800
But when I pilot the Ava...

1142
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,000
The same ceiling again.

1143
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,380
This is all I get when I pilot the Ava.

1144
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:20,460
Ray?

1145
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,340
How long have you been here?

1146
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,720
Listen, at zero hundred hours tomorrow,

1147
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,340
Operation Yashima is scheduled to begin.

1148
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,740
Pilots Ikari and Ayanami will report to Terminal 2.

1149
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,580
19.30 hours today.

1150
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,140
20.00 hours.

1151
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,700
The Evas, Unit 1 and Unit 0, will take position.

1152
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,080
20.05, we launch.

1153
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,460
20.30, arrive at Fortress 2, Futugo Mountain.

1154
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,080
After that, stand by for further orders.

1155
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,900
Tomorrow, when the date changes, the operation will commence.

1156
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:57,740
Your meal.

1157
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,760
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

1158
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,640
We're leaving in 90 minutes.

1159
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,020
They expect me to get back in that thing?

1160
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,100
They do.

1161
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,580
It's too much.

1162
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,020
I don't ever want to be that scared again.

1163
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,280
Not like that.

1164
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,360
Or I can't even run away.

1165
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,240
You're scared of the Eva?

1166
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,380
fine stay in bed

1167
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,160
stay but

1168
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,960
I'll pilot unit one myself

1169
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:29,960
Ray wait

1170
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:31,420
goodbye

1171
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,200
*Many*

1172
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,300
Enemy drill has now penetrated through Armored Level 17.

1173
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:51,920
Four hours and

1174
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,120
fifty-five minutes until we've reached Nerve Headquarters.

1175
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,100
Aerial Line 3

1176
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,840
now online in West Hakanay, Shinsen, and South

1177
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,380
Tonosan.

1178
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:58,960
Roger that.

1179
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,920
Begin system test. Route all power directly to central hub.

1180
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,740
Installment of 500,000 volt normal transformers on schedule.

1181
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,440
No change to timetable.

1182
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,580
Transformer array 28 is arrived five minutes late.

1183
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,600
Coordinators, please work to get them connected quickly.

1184
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,540
Container HQ3

1185
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,820
is cleared for unloading.

1186
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,940
Please confirm switch tests for superconductive ultra high voltage transformer arrays.

1187
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,580
Roger. Begin test zero one through five

1188
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:23,920
zero.

1189
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,540
operation

1190
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:28,120
validation starting with the first which just complete for all

1191
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:29,940
long-distance transmission system

1192
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,860
operating at full

1193
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:31,260
capacity

1194
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,400
so this is the prototype positron cannon it's

1195
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,920
a hasty construction job but the

1196
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,980
design is theoretically sound we'll

1197
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,140
be forcibly linking the zero-point control

1198
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,700
the unit one's type G equipment.

1199
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,900
Well, we'll be counting on you.

1200
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,960
Now, if only we could say the same

1201
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,640
of our pilot.

1202
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,700
Let's just hope Misato can bring him

1203
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,060
around.

1204
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:05,740
Here you are.

1205
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,240
What are you doing? You missed the rendezvous time.

1206
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:11,880
Listen.

1207
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,200
You made up your own mind to be a part of this.

1208
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:16,640
Now you need to do your job

1209
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,660
like you're supposed to.

1210
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,740
I'm just... I'm scared, okay?

1211
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,960
You all have it so easy.

1212
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,340
You're always safe underground at headquarters, giving out orders.

1213
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,980
I'm the only one in real danger.

1214
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,380
You want to tell me how that's fair?

1215
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,840
Come with me for a minute.

1216
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:44,620
No.

1217
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,320
Fifteen years ago, in the second impact, half the world's population was wiped out.

1218
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,640
If we allow the angels to bring about the third impact now, the human race won't survive.

1219
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,500
Not one single

1220
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,000
soul.

1221
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,660
I already know all this. I don't need to hear it again.

1222
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:20,700
If an angel should ever manage to get past our defenses and make its way all the way down here to level triple E, this whole place is set to automatically self-destruct.

1223
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:27,520
Even if it costs us our own lives to kill the angel, we will prevent the third impact from happening.

1224
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,720
Every man and woman in this organization is prepared to pay that price.

1225
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,400
What is that?

1226
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,000
It can't be.

1227
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:55,800
An Ava?

1228
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:56,460
No.

1229
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,260
What you're seeing is the origin of all life on this planet,

1230
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,260
as well as the key to its end.

1231
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,800
The second angel, Lilith.

1232
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,120
Lilith?

1233
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,440
That's right.

1234
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,240
And it's the trigger that will set off the third impact.

1235
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:12,800
We have to protect Lilith.

1236
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,720
That's what the Avas are for.

1237
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,460
And piloting one is something only you can do.

1238
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,380
In other words, we've entrusted the future of mankind

1239
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,360
and all life on Earth to you and the Ava.

1240
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,660
But that's so much to ask.

1241
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,760
I don't understand. Why me?

1242
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,780
There is no why.

1243
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,740
That destiny

1244
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,300
happened to be yours, that's all.

1245
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,160
However, I want you to understand that you're not the only one risking your life in this fight.

1246
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:39,300
We are all in this together.

1247
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,020
All right, I'll try.

1248
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:46,880
I'll pilot the Eva.

1249
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,780
Now then, you each have a specific role to perform in this operation.

1250
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,220
Now, Shinji.

1251
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:06,720
Yes?

1252
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,860
You will be the gunner in Unit 1.

1253
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:09,900
Right.

1254
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,680
Rei, you'll be in charge of Defense in Unit 0.

1255
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:13,860
Yes, ma'am.

1256
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:17,980
This operation will require a high degree of precision. There's no room for error.

1257
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:24,480
That being the case, since Unit Zero hasn't been calibrated, Unit One gives us a greater advantage, even in its damaged state.

1258
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:25,960
Listen to me, Shinji.

1259
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:32,060
Positrons are affected by the Earth's rotation, magnetic field, and gravity, so they won't travel in a straight line.

1260
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,440
Don't forget to compensate for those factors.

1261
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,200
When you fire, penetrate the core and only the core.

1262
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,960
But how will I know where it is? What if I miss it?

1263
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:49,000
Don't worry. Within the target, there's an object that materializes only while it's in combat mode. We've surmised that that is the core.

1264
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:55,040
Once you're in position, we'll enter all the specifics of the target location and fire guidance solution from our end.

1265
01:19:55,420 --> 01:20:02,840
You just do things by the book and hold the trigger when the center reticle lines up. As long as you do your part, the machines will do the rest.

1266
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:09,240
I will warn you, there is only one terminal convergence point for the power.

1267
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:14,060
Therefore, Unit 1 cannot move once it's in firing position.

1268
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,460
Meaning I can't run away?

1269
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:17,560
Correct.

1270
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,400
Then if I miss and

1271
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,420
the Angel fires back...

1272
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,140
No. Don't concern yourself with what-ifs right now.

1273
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,360
Concentrate on destroying your target in a single shot.

1274
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,600
Because if I miss, we're screwed. Is that it?

1275
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:33,700
So then. I just have to protect Unit 1, is that right?

1276
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,280
Correct.

1277
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:35,780
I understand.

1278
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,280
It's time.

1279
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:38,860
You two get changed.

1280
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:39,560
Right.

1281
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,740
You know...

1282
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:54,900
There's a chance we could both die on this mission.

1283
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,240
You're wrong.

1284
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,660
You won't die.

1285
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,720
Because I will protect you.

1286
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,940
But maybe I'm not worth protecting.

1287
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,080
It's a message left with the PR department at headquarters.

1288
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:16,760
Huh.

1289
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,820
Um, this is Toji.

1290
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,020
Hey, new kid.

1291
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:30,520
I mean, hey, Shinji.

1292
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,040
We're counting on you, man.

1293
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,320
You can do it.

1294
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:39,420
Hey, Kinsuke here. Shinji, hang in there, okay?

1295
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,900
The End

1296
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,040
Yes, a bond.

1297
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,960
With my dad?

1298
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,000
With everyone.

1299
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,620
You know, you're stronger than I am.

1300
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,640
That's because I have nothing else.

1301
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,200
It's time. We should go.

1302
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:56,560
Goodbye.

1303
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,620
Counting down to midnight.

1304
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,300
All units are in position.

1305
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Final seconds before operation launch.

1306
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,180
Here we go.

1307
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,420
Shinji, look.

1308
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:21,620
Whatever happens out there, I'm grateful to you just for trying.

1309
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:22,820
Thank you.

1310
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,040
Commence Operation Yashima.

1311
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,180

- The L3 was vaporized.

1348
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:07,900
- It'll notice us.

1349
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,060
Don't give it any time.

1350
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:09,800
Next phone.

1351
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:22,940

Final adjustments to Positron Accelerator.

1388
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,600
I don't have Ray's determination.

1389
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,160
I'm not sure I have any qualities that would make me a good EVA pilot.

1390
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:42,820
So why?

1391
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:48,160
All I did was get it to move, and now I'm protecting mankind?

1392
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,180
It's such a huge thing.

1393
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:52,420
I can't even get my mind around it.

1394
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:53,620
Why me?

1395
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:58,320
13, 12, 11, 10.

1396
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:04,540
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

1397
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,560
three, two, one.

1398
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:08,940
Now fire!

1399
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:29,940
Did we get it?

1400
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,700
We missed it!

1401
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,360
- But how? Our timing was perfect.

1402
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:40,520
- It's charging!

1403
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,240
Energy ratings rising!

1404
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,780
- Everyone, brace for direct impact!

1405
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,660
*Squad*

1406
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,780
How's the power system?

1407
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,020
Still online. Looks like it's already starting to recharge.

1408
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,780
And the positron cannon?

1409
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:29,260
Minor damage. It appears to be mostly superficial, but I'm not sure if we'll get another shot out of it.

1410
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,200
No time

1411
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,920
to wait. We'll just have to try it.

1412
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,180
Shinji, are you alright?

1413
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:37,820
Hurry! Get Unit 1 back into firing position! Now!

1414
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,040
Shinji!

1415
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:40,100
Hey!

1416
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,340
Effective immediately.

1417
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,480
The Unit 1 pilot is relief of duty.

1418
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,520
Order the Unit 0 pilot to take over the gunner position.

1419
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,120
Ikari, are

1420
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:58,380
you...

1421
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,160
You heard me. He's clearly useless.

1422
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:00,960
Pull him

1423
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,020
out.

1424
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,200
No, Commander, wait!

1425
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:03,420
He

1426
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,060
could have run away, but he got in the Ava.

1427
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,580
As long as he still chooses to fight,

1428
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:09,000
we should trust him to see this through.

1429
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,040
Shinji, hang in there, okay?

1430
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:15,340
We're counting on you, man.

1431
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:34,780
I'm asking you to have faith in your own son.

1432
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,880
Have faith with me that he is the Unit 1 pilot.

1433
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:50,620
I'll leave it to you. Do as you see fit.

1434
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:51,740
Thank you, Commander.

1435
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:53,680
Shinji.

1436
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:54,920
I'm here.

1437
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:56,560
One more time.

1438
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:58,580
With all the power of Japan behind you.

1439
01:29:59,200 --> 01:29:59,840
All of our hopes.

1440
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:00,920
Our future.

1441
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:01,840
Our lives.

1442
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:04,460
Along with the lives of every creature on this planet.

1443
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,880
It's all in your hands now.

1444
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:08,500
Do your best.

1445
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:09,680
Right.

1446
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,720
Barrel, lock in position.

1447
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,380
Unit 1 has discarded Type G equipment.

1448
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,140
Switching all final firing system controls to manual.

1449
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,140
Enemy control, range 1

1450
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,300
-0, about 10 quarters.

1451
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:30,900
Hurry

1452
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,980
up with the second round!

1453
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,180
Fuse exchanged. Barrel cool down complete.

1454
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:37,500
Power transmission...

1455
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:37,960
Positron

1456
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:40,080
cannon magnetic acceleration being stated.

1457
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,480
Cannon cycling up.

1458
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,120
Pleasure approaching maximum tolerances.

1459
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,940
New firing solution has been entered.

1460
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,740
All further error compensation will be left to the pilot's manual controls.

1461
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,920
Aggression zero point to speed up warning.

1462
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,280
Target's energy levels are on the rise!

1463
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:55,520
What? No!

1464
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:04,500
Shit!

1465
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,440
Shit!

1466
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,920
Come on!

1467
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,420
Hurry, hurry!

1468
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,660
Go on, hurry!

1469
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:41,760
I'm sorry!

1470
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,560
Yes, you did it!

1471
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,540
*gunshot*

1472
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,380
Ray! Ray!

1473
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:51,880
Ray!

1474
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,600
I'm sorry.

1475
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:22,660
Ah!

1476
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,820
Ray! Ray! Are you alright? Ray!

1477
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,300
You have nothing, really? You were just gonna leave me on that?

1478
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,900
And that whole dramatic goodbye thing? Don't do that again, okay?

1479
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,820
Why are you crying?

1480
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:06,780
I'm sorry.

1481
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,860
I guess I don't know what to do in situations like this.

1482
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,560
You could start by

1483
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,080
smiling.

1484
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:31,820
I'm sorry.

1485
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,260
I already know.

1486
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:56,520
If you're waking me, the child has appeared.

1487
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,980
And we've entered the summation stage, right?

1488
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,040
Correct.

1489
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:04,780
The apocrypha of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been passed into the Book of Law.

1490
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:07,560
The time with the Covenant is close at hand.

1491
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,200
The third one again, huh?

1492
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,980
You haven't changed.

1493
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,240
I'm looking forward to seeing you, Shinji Ikari.

1494
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:21,200
I don't know.

1495
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,560
If you want to make a mistake,

1496
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:49,100
I don't know yet, I'm sorry

1497
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:56,960
I've done a lot of things

1498
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:01,920
I've done a lot of things

1499
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:02,500
I've done a little bit

1500
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:14,540
I don't need to know what I'm doing

1501
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,780
If you're not a good person, I'm fine

1502
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,040
But I don't care

1503
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:32,460
if

1504
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:32,460
I'm not a bad person

1505
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:50,080
I'll see you next time.

1506
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:36,200
Killer temple world

1507
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:44,040
Killer temple boy

1508
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,520
Killer temple world

1509
01:39:57,620 --> 01:40:00,880
Killer temple boy

1510
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,940
Ava Unit 5 is mobilized.

1511
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,240
Ava Unit 2 and its pilot are assigned.

1512
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:30,460
EVA Unit 4 ceases to exist.

1513
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,700
EVA Unit 3 undergoes a forced activation experiment.

1514
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:36,960
And EVA Unit 6 and its pilot come flying from the moon.

1515
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,760
As Shinji and Kari's story gradually falls apart,

1516
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,020
how will all of these pieces come together?

1517
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:45,040
Coming soon, Evangelion 2.

1518
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:46,240
You cannot advance.

1519
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:49,940
And don't worry, there'll be plenty more fan service on

1520
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:50,440
the way, too.
