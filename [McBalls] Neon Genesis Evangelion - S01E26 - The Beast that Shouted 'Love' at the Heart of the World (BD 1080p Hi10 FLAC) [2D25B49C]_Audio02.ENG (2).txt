Speaker 1
As a poor man, like a young man, you will be a man. The blue wind is now Even though I'm just looking at The back of the back of the world is "You are a

Speaker 2
me anyway, do you? Using that as an excuse is no different than running away.

Speaker 3
What you truly fear is failure, isn't it? You fear that you may be hated by others. You fear acknowledging that weakness even to yourself.

Speaker 2
How can you criticize

Speaker 3
me when you do the same thing? You're right. At the core, we are all the same. Our minds lack something basic. And we fear that lack. And that is why we are attempting to become one. We will meld with and fill each other. This is the Instrumentality.

Speaker 4
Mankind cannot live without being surrounded by others. Mankind cannot live alone.

Speaker 3
Although you yourself are always unique.

Speaker 4
That is why life is hard.

Speaker 3
That is why life is sad and empty. Thus you want the close physical and mental presence of others. That is why we wish to become one.

Speaker 4
The human soul is made of weak and fragile

Speaker 5
elements. The body

Speaker 3
and mind are made of brittle components as well.

Speaker 5
And so, via the instrumentality, mankind must fill and complement each other. Must you ask? Because there's no other way to exist.

Speaker 3
Why do you exist? Maybe I exist to find out why I exist. For whom do you exist? For myself, of course. Maybe for myself. Are you happy being alive?

Speaker 2
I don't know.

Speaker 3
Are you happy being alive? Of course I'm happy! Are you happy being alive? I don't want to do anything except be happy.

Speaker 4
Do you hate being sad?

Speaker 6
I don't like it.

Speaker 4
Do you hate enduring pain?

Speaker 3
I don't like it.

Speaker 5
Is that why you run away?

Speaker 3
Yes. Do you blame me? What's wrong with running away from something that hurts? I mustn't run away. Tell me why you mustn't run away. Because escaping from reality can be painful. Even though you're running from something more painful. I couldn't bear it. As long as you know what the pain is, it can be endured. That's correct. If the pain is too harsh, you can escape it. If you really hate it, Shinji, you can still run.

Speaker 2
No, I won't. I'm

Speaker 3
tired of escaping. Yes, I mustn't run

Speaker 1
away.

Speaker 3
That is true. That is because you are now aware that running only brings you more pain. This is because running away can be far worse. That's why you do not wish to escape.

Speaker 2
Because if you run away, nobody will respect you. Don't leave me alone. Don't deserve me. I'm begging you. There he goes again, depending upon others who do everything for him. That's a sad survival mechanism, isn't it? So what? It's better than being left all alone. Because you fear being hurt. You try to make

Speaker 3
yourself believe that,

Speaker 7
don't you?

Speaker 8
You're not the only one who gets hurt, Shinji. Everybody feels pain. You aren't the only one.

Speaker 7
It's just easier for you to think that it's true, isn't it? Shut up! I don't care! Why should

Speaker 3
I? Nobody cares about me! Once again, you've abandoned all sense of self-value, of self-worth. I have nothing. There you

Speaker 1
go again, saying

Speaker 3
that you have no worth at all. Do you believe that by not expecting anything, you won't get hurt either? Is that how you sustain your pathetic ego, by asking others to praise you?

Speaker 2
Nobody accepts me.

Speaker 3
That's not true. You just believe that is so. And so that's why I must pilot the Ava. Again, that is merely your point of view. You've been trying to convince yourself that you're worthless since the very beginning. But I have to! I've got to do it!

Speaker 8
No, that's not true. You don't have to. No, you just think you do. No, you're wrong.

Speaker 2
My life is pointless otherwise. And that's why you pilot the Ava? Piloting Ava gives me an identity. A purpose. Piloting Ava gives me an identity. A purpose. I had no value before I became a pilot. The fact that I now pilot an Ava justifies my presence here. I have no other

Speaker 3
value. I have no other value.

Speaker 2
I have no other value, no other value at all. I perceive no value in myself. I hate myself!

Speaker 8
YOU LILTLE WORM! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! Me, too. I hate you, too. I hate everything about you!

Speaker 3
I'm sorry but... I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I

Speaker 4
hate you, I hate you.

Speaker 9
I hate everything about you,

Speaker 4
I hate you.

Speaker 9
Oh Shinji, I hate you.

Speaker 2
See? Everyone hates me! Every person in existence must hate me! No, that's just what you imagine. Yes! But that must be it, because I hate myself!

Speaker 3
Because you hate yourself, no one respects you. I hate

Speaker 2
you! I hate you! I hate everything! But they praise me. They're nice to me. When I pilot the Eva, they treat me better. Other people are being nice to me for the first time. Which is your true feeling? I don't know. Or is it perhaps that both are my true feelings? So that's why you pilot the Ava? Because I have no choice. I only have the Ava. Otherwise,

Speaker 3
you could not retain your own identity. In fact, Ava Unit 1 is part of your sense of being. But if you depend only on the Ava, then the Ava will become your only identifier.

Speaker 8
Ava will become your only value.

Speaker 3
Without that value, you, the real you, will be erased from this existence.

Speaker 2
I don't care! I had no other value to start with anyway! I was learning to play the cello, but that didn't help me either!

Speaker 3
You just didn't discipline yourself! I didn't have to do that!

Speaker 2
But now that I can pilot the Ava... No. Soon you may lose your identity,

Speaker 3
as I have. Soon you may lose Ava and your self-worth.

Speaker 2
I pilot it

Speaker 3
because that's all I can

Speaker 2
do.

Speaker 6
Rain. Dark shadows of gloom hang above me. That's how I feel. This isn't how I want it to be.

Speaker 3
This is not the ending of love. This is not how I wish it to be.

Speaker 6
Morning.

Speaker 3
The beginning of a day. Another terrible day. I wish this wasn't the way it is.

Speaker 2
The sky. Something warm. Something unfamiliar. Something that fills me with horror. I don't want this. I don't want it to be this way. I hate everything! What do you want, Shinji?

Speaker 3
What do you want, Shinji? What do you want, Shinji? Don't

Speaker 3
hate me, please! What I fear is... What I want

Speaker 2
is... Can I stay next to you? May I stay here?

Speaker 3
Do you like me? Do you want to go where your mother is? No. Don't you want to go be with your father?

Speaker 2
No, I don't.

Speaker 3
Why? Because I'm afraid of being hated. Because my identity might start to disappear. What is it that you wish for? What is it that you want?

Speaker 2
You're very insecure, aren't you? To become secure, I have to have... Value! I want to be worth something! I want to be worth enough to attract the attention of others!

Speaker 10
But your value is something you have to find for yourself. You have to find it, Genji.

Speaker 2
I have no value without it. My life is worthless without it.

Speaker 3
Then what am I?

Speaker 2
Then what am I?

Speaker 3
What am

Speaker 11
I?

Speaker 2
Wait, what is this? This is me. This is the shape that lets others recognize me as myself. It is my symbol for myself. This is, this is, and this is as well. Representations. Everything is merely a description, not the real myself. Everything is simply a shape, a form, an identifier to let others recognize me as me. But then, what am I? Is this me? My true self? My fake self? What is it that I am?

Speaker 3
You are you. There is little difference between how

Speaker 2
you interpret yourself and how the others interpret you. Right. My clothes, my shoes, my room. These are all parts of what makes up myself. These things are connected through your consciousness. So what I think is me is me. What I recognize as self is myself. I'm no more and no less than the sum of my self-awareness, but I don't understand myself. Where am I? What am I? Nobody understands

Speaker 11
me!

Speaker 3
What are you, stupid? Of course nobody understands you! Nobody can ever understand you! The only one who can take care of you and understand you is... you, yourself. So you must take care of yourself.

Speaker 2
But I still don't understand myself! I don't even know what it is that makes me myself! How could I love myself?!

Speaker 3
You are still unstable. That is, the present you. And the people around the present you. And the environment that surrounds the present you. None of these elements of reality last forever. Time continues to flow, and time brings change. Your world is in a state of constant change. You're capable of change any time your mind perceives these changes.

Speaker 2
What is this? A world of nothing? A world with nobody in it? This is the world of perfect freedom. Freedom? Perfect

Speaker 3
freedom. A world in which you have no restriction. Is this really freedom? Yes. This is what it is. However, this world has nothing in it.

Speaker 2
Unless I do something?

Speaker 3
Right. Unless you do or think of something. But I don't know what to do or think of. He is uncertain. He has no self-image to orient himself. There's nothing solid here. It is a world in which there are no obstacles, no anything. And yet, you are still afraid, aren't you? What should I do?

Speaker 5
Let me give you a restriction.

Speaker 3
There. Now you have a top and bottom. But you have lost a degree of your freedom. You may no longer fly. You must stand upon the earth.

Speaker 5
But now you feel easier, don't you? Because you have less to trouble your mind. And now you can walk.

Speaker 9
This is happening because you will it to be. Is this my will? This world with the floor is the only thing around yourself.

Speaker 8
But now you can move around anywhere you wish to within it. You could even turn the world upside down if you wanted to do that.

Speaker 3
And your perspective within your world is constantly changing.

Speaker 8
It changes with the

Speaker 5
passage of time. Because the thing that forms your shape is your mind and its interaction with the world that surrounds you.

Speaker 2
You can do anything here, because this is your world. This

is the shape of reality. Reality.

Speaker 2
What is this? An empty space? An empty world? A world where nothing exists but myself? But with only myself, I have nothing to interact with. It's as if I'm here, but not here at all. It's as if I'm slowly fading out of existence. Because only you are here. Only myself? Without others to interact with, you cannot truly recognize your own image. My own image?

Speaker 3
That's right. In the act of observing others, you may find and recognize yourself. Your self-image is restrained by having to observe the barriers between yourself and others. And yet, you cannot see yourself without the presence of others.

Speaker 2
Because there are others, I can perceive myself as an individual. If I am alone, then I will be the same without others. For

Speaker 3
if this world is only of me, then there will be no difference between me and nothing! By recognizing the differences between yourself and others, you establish your identity as yourself. Your mother

Speaker 2
is

Speaker 3
a different individual.

Speaker 2
Right. I am me and she is she. But are you really sure that the perceptions of others form my true self?

Speaker 3
Has it taken you this long to realize that? What an idiot! Huh? It's about time you got up, you idiot.

Speaker 6
Oh, it's you, Asuka.

Speaker 3
What the hell does that mean? Can't you appreciate that I went to the trouble of coming to wake you up personally? I don't hear any words of appreciation for your oldest childhood friend.

Speaker 2
Oh, thanks. Let me sleep a little more. Hey,

Speaker 3
get up, you! It's time to get up, you dark!

Speaker 12
You stupid bird! I didn't mean to get that up! I can't help it. It's morning. I gotta take a whiz or something.

Speaker 10
Oh, my. Oscar's so sweet to come pick him up every morning, and he doesn't appreciate it.

Speaker 5
Hmm. Is that so, dear?

Speaker 10
Yes, dear. And you have to get ready, too.

Speaker 5
I'm always ready, dear.

Speaker 10
Gosh, you are just like Shinji.

Speaker 5
Mm-hmm. You ready?

Speaker 10
Anytime. I am the one who gets complaints from Professor Fuyutsuki if you're late for the meeting.

Speaker 5
That's true. He's your biggest fan. Oh,

Speaker 10
you? Cut that out and

Speaker 12
get ready.

Speaker 5
Yes, dear. She who must be obeyed.

Speaker 12
Hurry up! Jeez, you're such a pain in the ass sometimes. Is this what happens when you start your period? What?

Speaker 3
What did you say? Ow! Mrs. Zucari, we're leaving now. Uh, see you later, Mom. See you, sweetie. Come

Speaker 10
on, dear. Put the newspaper down. Uh,

Speaker 8
all

Speaker 3
right. Hey, isn't a new student starting today? Yeah, that's right. Since this city's going to become the new capital, There are a lot of people moving in. It's no wonder we're getting so many new kids. - That makes sense. I wonder what she's like. Oh, I hope she's got a great butt. - Oh crap, I'm late. I can't be late for the first day.

Speaker 11
I'm sorry! I'm really in a hurry, kid! I'm really sorry! Bye, dear!

Speaker 3
Wow! So did you

Speaker 2
see her panties then? Well, it wasn't a good look really. Just a little flash.

Speaker 8
Oh! I can't believe it that you're the one who has all the luck! What'd you do that for?

Speaker 7
Exactly what were you just talking about, Mr. Suzuhara? It's time to put that idle butt of yours to work! Change the water in the flower vases! Oh, she's

Speaker 3
mean!

Speaker 7
Did you just say something?

Speaker 2
Poor Toji's so carpet-bagged. It's sad, isn't it? Look who's talking. Hey, are you saying that I'm... I'm merely reporting the fact.

Speaker 1
How so? It

Speaker 2
just

Speaker 3
is! Accept it! Hey, why do you treat me like this? Hey, that hurts, you idiot! Ow,

Speaker 8
Stan! The calm, the peace and tranquility. *Bang*

*Bang* *Bang*

Speaker 3
Oh yeah!

Speaker 13
Miss Residdle our teacher!

Speaker 3
Oh, she's gorgeous! Wow! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Look at that!

Speaker 13
Oh! She just... the best! Oh yeah!

Speaker 3
Just look at those three stooges! Have they no shame! *Bang* Listen up dudes, we've got a new blue haired babe here to introduce herself. My name's Rei Ayanami. How's it hanging? No! You're the jerk who was staring at my panties! Hey! What do you mean by that? You're the one who was flashing them, you know. Who are you and why are you defending him? Are you riding his baloney pony?

Speaker 13
No!

Speaker 3
We're just really good childhood friends! You shut up! Be quiet you two, we're in a class, not a bar. Hey, this is more entertaining than class. Go on, I want to see how this turns out. Hey, Shinji, you didn't

Speaker 8
tell me you were

Speaker 3
getting it with Asuka.

Speaker 2
I see. So this is another possibility. Another possible reality. This current myself is the same way. It's not the true myself. I can be any way I wish to be. I see. And myself, who is not an Ava pilot, can exist as well. If you take that into consideration, then perhaps this world isn't that bad. Still, the reality itself might not be bad, but I could still hate myself.

Speaker 8
But it's your mind which takes reality and separates it into what's bad and hateful. It is only the mind which separates reality from truth.

Speaker 9
Any new position from which you view your reality will change your perception of its nature. It's all literally a matter of perspective.

Speaker 3
There are as many

Speaker 4
truths as

Speaker 8
there are people. But there's only one truth that is your truth. That's the one that's formed from whatever point of view to view it from. It's a revised perception that protects you. That's true, and one can have a perspective that's far too small.

Speaker 3
However, a person can only see things from the perspective that they choose to see them from. One must learn to judge things via the perceived truths that one receives from others. For example, sunny days make you feel good. Rainy days make you feel gloomy. If you are told this is so, then that is what you believe is so. But you can have fun on a rainy day as well.

Speaker 4
Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it. That's how fragile the truth for a human is.

Speaker 5
A person's truth is so simple that most ignore it to concentrate on what they think are deeper truths. You, for example, are simply unused to what it is to be liked by others.

Speaker 3
You've never learned how to deal with fearing what others feel about you, and so you avoid it. But... don't the others hate me? What are you, stupid? Haven't you realized it's all in your imagination, you mega-dork?

Speaker 2
But I hate myself.

Speaker 3
One who truly hates himself cannot love. He cannot place his trust in another.

Speaker 2
I'm a coward. I'm cowardly, sneaky, and weak. No. Only if you think you are, but if you know yourself, you can take care of yourself. I hate myself. But maybe I could love myself. Maybe my life could have a greater value. That's right. I am no more or less than myself. I am me. I want to be myself. I want to continue existing in this world. My life is worth living here.

Speaker 11
Yay! You're the best!

Speaker 3
Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!

Speaker 2
Thank you all!

Speaker 11
I'm

Speaker 11
not alone. In other words, truly kiss me Feel my heart with song And let me sing forevermore You are all I long for All I want, sit and adore In other words Please be true In other words

I love you
